# GraphQL Queries

Here, we're going to define some GraphQL queries and VueJS will be using these.

The syntax it generally follows is described here: https://graphql.org/learn/queries/

Though remember, the postgraphile is our act GraphQL implementation. postgraphile follows
the philosophy of graphQL, but introduces elements, so that's why you want see the same 
variable names in the .gql queries here as you will in the official GraphQL docs.

To learn how to use graphQL and query the engine, I would look to our API's 
http://localhost:5000/graphiql page that it sets up when it is running.
