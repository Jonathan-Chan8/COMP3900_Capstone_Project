1	A Liberal National party backbencher has called on the Australian government to lodge a formal protest with the US over the treatment of Julian Assange after a court heard claims of previous plans to poison or kidnap the Wikileaks founder. After a former employee of a private security firm told an extradition hearing in London this week of those alleged discussions between sources in US intelligence and the company, George Christensen told Guardian Australia: “The latest revelations show a foreign power tried to use illegal means to harm an Australian citizen.” Christensen and independent MP Andrew Wilkie met the British high commissioner to Australia on Friday to raise concerns about Assange’s welfare and question whether due process was being observed. Wilkie tweeted after the meeting that the high commissioner, Vicki Treadell, had given the pair “a good hearing” and promised to report the concerns back to London: Wilkie said there were limits to what a high commissioner could say in such situations, but Treadell “was very much in listening mode to hear our concerns” during the half hour video conference, while being mindful the matter was before the courts. Wilkie said he and Christensen argued that Assange should not be extradited to the US and should be allowed to return to Australia - but if that was not to occur, the Wikileaks co-founder should be released into community detention and have full access to his legal representatives. “I also spoke about how the UK, US and Australian governments are misjudging the community mood on this and the mood has shifted in recent times,” Wilkie said. Assange is fighting extradition to the US on charges relating to leaks of classified documents allegedly exposing US war crimes and abuse. “I’ve grown more and more concerned about Julian’s plight since I saw him back in February before the trial began,” Christensen said. “The latest revelations show a foreign power tried to use illegal means to harm an Australian citizen. It’s not on. “I think the latest revelations are deserving of a formal protest by the Australian government. If any security firm plotted or attempted to undertake illegal action against an Australian then perhaps criminal charges should be laid.” The comments come after a lawyer for Assange read out at the Old Bailey in London on Wednesday portions of written evidence provided by a former employee of Spanish security firm UC Global and another person who had been involved with the company. These included claims that the UC Global founder and director, David Morales, had said in 2017 his American contacts had suggested “more extreme measures” should be deployed against visitors to Assange, who had been sheltering at the Ecuadorian embassy in London. UC Global had been contracted by the government of Ecuador to provide security for its embassy. “There was a suggestion that the door of the embassy would be left open allowing people to enter from the outside and kidnap or poison Assange,” the court was told. The witness alleged Morales said these suggestions were under consideration with his contacts in the US. The independent South Australian senator Rex Patrick said the allegations aired in the British court about surveillance of and plans to harm Assange raised “very strong doubts about whether Mr Assange could ever receive a fair trial in the United States”. Patrick called on the Australian government to “get off its backside and afford Julian Assange much more than the minimal ‘consular assistance’ it has belatedly offered so far”. He said it was a case that went “to the very heart of freedom of the press worldwide” and involved the liberty of an Australian citizen in circumstances that were extraordinary by any measure. “Australian foreign [affairs] minister Marise Payne needs to make a very clear public statement of support for Mr Assange, an Australian journalist and citizen, whose position as a journalist is no different from the editors of the New York Times, the Guardian or the Sydney Morning Herald which all published the same leaked US government reports and cables that are at the heart of this case,” Patrick said. “Anything less will be a betrayal of an Australian citizen and a betrayal of media freedom.” James Lewis QC, acting for the US government, told the court on Tuesday that the US case was likely to be that the evidence of the former UC Global employees was “wholly irrelevant”. The Australian government has previously responded to questions about the Assange case by stressing the independence of the British judiciary. In June the Australian trade minister, Simon Birmingham, was asked whether he believed Assange should be extradited to the US. He said it was “a matter rightly determined by the British courts”. “Probably one of the great legacies that Australia has inherited from the United Kingdom is indeed that independence of judiciary and the judgment and decision making that it makes, and I’ll back them to make the right decision,” Birmingham said at the time. When asked in parliament in February Payne said Australia was “in regular contact with authorities in the United Kingdom, in line with our consular mandate, and have been assured by those authorities that Mr Assange is being held in appropriate and humane conditions”. But she added that the Australian government had “no standing in any of Mr Assange’s legal proceedings and is unable to intervene in them”. Christensen, Wilkie and Patrick were among a small group of Australian parliamentarians who wrote to Payne four months ago to call on the Australian government to press its British counterpart for Assange to be released on bail.
2	Firefighters in northern California are warily watching for “violent” winds expected to return to the Napa-Sonoma area, amid continuing extreme heat and low humidity. Red flag warnings of extreme fire danger were to continue into Friday evening for large swaths of northern California. “It’s going to be a big firefight for us in the next 36 hours,” said Mark Brunton, Cal Fire operations section chief, during a late-morning briefing. He added commanders were forced to make do with “a limited amount of resources” due to competing demands for fire personnel throughout the state. More than 2,000 firefighters are battling the Glass fire, which has charred 89 sq miles in Napa and Sonoma counties with almost no containment. It has destroyed about 250 buildings, including 143 homes. The utility company Pacific Gas and Electric also cut power to another 3,100 customers in Napa county at the request of firefighters, the Santa Rosa Press Democrat reported. Hot weather and the potential for fire damage could stress power supplies as people switch on their air conditioners. To avoid shortages, the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state’s power grid, issued a statewide Flex Alert for 3pm to 10pm Thursday. It urged customers to avoid using large appliances during that time and to keep the thermostat at 78F (25.6C) or above. A mid-August heatwave strained the grid to the point where Cal ISO ordered utilities to implement brief rolling blackouts for the first time since 2001. About 150 miles to the north of wine country, the Zogg fire, which also erupted during Sunday’s high winds and grew quickly, has killed four people, the Shasta county sheriff, Eric Magrini, said. A man evacuated with severe burns on Sunday died at a hospital of his injuries on Tuesday, Magrini said. Three others died on Sunday. The deadly blaze that spread to neighboring Tehama county has burned 86 sq miles and destroyed 146 buildings, about half of them homes. But fire crews made significant progress on Thursday, with officials saying the fire was now 26% contained. The Glass and Zogg fires are among nearly 30 wildfires burning in California. Fire-related deaths in California this year total 30. Numerous studies in recent years have linked bigger wildfires in America to global warming from the burning of coal, oil and gas, especially because climate change has made California much drier. A drier California means plants are more flammable. Firefighters say the intense blazes are also becoming harder to fight. On Wednesday, officials said wind-whipped flames led two firefighters to deploy the emergency fire shelters they carry in case of imminent danger from flames The firefighters were assigned to the Glass fire on Sunday when gusty offshore winds fanned the fire, forcing them to deploy the shelters after flames overwhelmed them. The firefighters covered themselves on the ground with the space blanket-looking devices. They were not injured, the California department of forestry and fire protection said. It’s the third time fire crews have had to deploy their fire shelters this month – a last-resort effort to save their lives that was once uncommon. On 8 September, 14 firefighters deployed emergency shelters as flames overtook them and destroyed the fire station they were defending in the Los Padres national forest. Three firefighters were hospitalized and later released. A day later, a crew fighting a deadly blaze in Butte county was overrun by flames when winds shifted; its members escaped with only minor injuries after deploying emergency shelters. Meanwhile in Colorado and Wyoming, two big mountain wildfires were growing again after burning dozens of cabins and other structures. A forecast calling for at least several more days of dry, breezy weather offered little help in the fight against the Cameron Peak fire west of Fort Collins, Colorado, or the Mullen fire west of Cheyenne, Wyoming. Higher humidity, however, bought firefighters time before the fires’ usual afternoon flare-ups. They intentionally burned debris in some places to deprive the fires of fuel while helicopters dumped water on some of the hottest areas. The fires are two of the Rocky Mountain region’s biggest fires in recent years. Each was burning through rugged pine forest dotted with communities of cabins, many of which aren’t inhabited year-round. Both were approaching 200 square miles in size.
3	Strictly Come Dancing contestant HRVY has tested positive for coronavirus, just over two weeks before the launch of the new series. The singer and YouTube star, whose real name is Harvey Leigh Cantwell, announced the news on social media, telling fans he does not have any symptoms and is now isolating for 10 days. The 21-year-old said: “hi, wasn’t gonna worry anyone and say anything but now the story’s out, i have coronavirus, I’m all good, no symptoms, just isolating for the next 10 days. already super bored so prepare yourselves for my Tik toks.” “It just proves that us youngsters can get it and not even realise,” he told his 4.5 million Instagram followers. “I’m fine, I’m chilling, but I’m going to be in this bedroom for a while so I’ll see you guys on the other side.” All contestants are being tested for Covid-19 twice a week, with the first tests taking place on Monday and revealing HRVY’s infection. This year’s stars are set to be introduced to their professional dance partners on 12 October, just days after HRVY’s isolation is due to end, ahead of a pre-recorded launch episode on 17 October. From that point onwards contestants will be eliminated from the show if they test positive for the virus. The live shows will start the following week, on 24 October. The show’s professional dancers have been isolating together in a hotel as they prepare the big dance numbers, and once the pros and celebs are matched up they won’t have contact with other pairs, the BBC’s entertainment boss, Kate Phillips, explained. There are also fewer contestants this year, a smaller studio audience and there will be no crowding around presenter Claudia Winkleman after each routine for post-dance interviews. This year’s lineup includes the actor Caroline Quentin, the Made in Chelsea star Jamie Laing and the Olympic boxer Nicola Adams, who will be performing as part of the show’s first same-sex couple. A BBC spokesman confirmed a member of the Strictly Come Dancing group had tested positive. They added: “We have rigorous protocols in place to manage Covid-19 as the safety of all those involved in the production is paramount.”
4	1) Positives for Villa as champions come to town Jack Grealish responded to the news that Ross Barkley had signed for Aston Villa in typically impish fashion: a tweet full of heart emojis. And why not? Barkley, arriving on a season-long loan, is quite the coup for a side that just about stayed up last season by a single point. The question is how Dean Smith finds a place for Barkley in a midfield that has now found some balance – Villa are now unbeaten in six league games after their 3-0 win at Fulham. Smith would be smart to leave Barkley out of the XI for the visit of Liverpool on Sunday – his side will need defensive discipline and tactical awareness that has obviously been honed on the training ground in recent weeks – but his time will come. Beyond this weekend, Barkley should revel in being a creative talisman once again alongside Grealish. Villa feel a good fit. MB • Aston Villa v Liverpool (Sunday, 7.15pm – all times BST) 2) Thiago Silva in for another test against Palace Wilfried Zaha was the most fouled player in the Premier League last season after Jack Grealish. But the mistreatment of poor old Jordan Ayew tends not to get mentioned so much. Ayew was the league’s third most fouled player last season, joining his Palace teammate and Grealish as the only people to be hacked down more than 100 times in the course of the campaign. But Ayew is not cowed – in fact, he was also the league’s most prolific fouler last season. All things considered, then, he will be a testing opponent for Thiago Silva, who is attempting to bring order to a chaotic Chelsea back line while adapting to the Premier League at the age of 36. Assuming, that is, that Frank Lampard persists with the Brazilian in central defence after last week’s unhappy debut at West Brom. PD • Chelsea v Crystal Palace (Saturday 12.30pm) 3) Reguilón facing another early Spurs test It was not a perfect debut for Sergio Reguilón against Chelsea in the Carabao Cup – the new Tottenham left-back was partly at fault in the buildup to Timo Werner’s goal – but there were glimpses of huge potential. He provided the cross for Érik Lamela’s equaliser and looked very composed on the ball, as would be expected of a Real Madrid graduate. But above all, it was refreshing for Spurs to have some searing pace in the position. One particular moment stood out, Reguilón making up 15 yards on a sprinting Callum Hudson-Odoi to make an outstanding recovering tackle. Should Mason Greenwood start for Manchester United on the right wing, Reguilón will need to continue his form, and will need all of that pace. MB • Manchester United v Tottenham (Sunday, 4.30pm) 4) Blades would now take a scrappy draw at Arsenal In January, Chris Wilder was unhappy with his side despite their salvaging a late draw at the Emirates. Wilder felt Sheffield United had got away with one, performing nowhere near the standards they had set in a season that saw them routinely outwit more fancied opponents. On Sunday he would probably take the muckiest of points, though, given the Blades are goalless and pointless from three games against sides who would all once have been classed as beatable. It might not technically be a case of second-season syndrome, given they also lost their final three fixtures of 2019-20, but something is not quite right and Wilder knows reinforcements would freshen things up. He has called this “the hardest window I’ve ever experienced” and there is no doubt his team is crying out for some added firepower. Against Arsenal they will probably be required to go with what they have got, but the same goes for their opponents given the uncertainty over Houssem Aouar’s arrival. Arsenal often struggle to get going when they are expected to take the initiative in games, as they recently showed against West Ham. Even if United have to ride their luck again, digging in could finally get them back on their feet. NA • Arsenal v Sheffield United (Sunday, 2pm) 5) Leeds v Man City set to be a football fiesta Manchester City responded to their first league defeat last season by winning their next league game 8-0. Leeds are no Watford but we can be sure that Pep Guardiola will be demanding another goal spree. Marcelo Bielsa will probably do likewise so this showdown could be a breathless attacking fiesta. The managers have similar thoughts about the game but their personalities are different: it might just be that Guardiola’s is starting to wear on his players, whereas belief in Bielsa is inspiring a team of comparatively modest parts to greater feats. Saturday’s clash at Elland Road could be revealing; it will definitely be entertaining. PD • Leeds v Manchester City (Saturday 5.30pm) 6) Focus on another Colombian at Goodison It’s already been quite the ride for Steven Alzate. Born in Camden to Colombian parents, the midfielder came through Leyton Orient – after a successful loan spell at Swindon, he made his Premier League debut for Brighton a year ago, at left wing-back versus Newcastle, and was named man of the match. He made his international debut for Colombia shortly afterwards, and was given the No 10 shirt in the following match, with James Rodríguez injured. This season, the 22-year-old has started every league game for Brighton in central midfield and will come face-to-face with Rodríguez this weekend in a trip to Everton, as two form teams meet at Goodison. Alzate has got quite the package: South American flair combined with a steel forged in League Two. He is young, composed, versatile and could go right to the top. MB • Everton v Brighton (Saturday, 3pm) 7) Is the jig up for Burnley? Burnley make this particular writer look stupid every season but early signs have done little to alleviate the suspicion that, this time, the jig might be up for Sean Dyche’s redoubtable group. For a club in their fifth straight top-flight season there appears to be very little money sloshing around and eventually, for all the remarkably consistent application their core of players has shown, there comes a point when the magic wears off. Dyche rowed back slightly on his previous call for action in the transfer market this week, rightly pointing out that Burnley have several key men injured, but he surely knows they are in danger of being outflanked by a number of rivals who are cleaning up their acts and investing smartly. It will be instructive to see whether they can recover any of their old gusto against a shapeless Newcastle, who were mightily fortunate to come out of the past week with a point at Spurs and progress to the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup. Dyche and Burnley have risen to challenges like this many times before; it will be another notable achievement if they can do it again. NA • Newcastle v Burnley (Saturday, 8pm) 8) Leicester and West Ham both out to prove a point These two teams enjoyed superb victories last weekend but Leicester followed that up in the transfer market by beating West Ham to Wesley Fofana, a hugely promising centre-back who should greatly enhance Brendan Rodgers’s options once his transfer is complete. West Ham’s existing defenders, meanwhile, will have to find a way to cope on Sunday with a thrilling home attack consisting of James Maddison, who was omitted from the latest England squad, Harvey Barnes – who has justifiably been called up by Gareth Southgate – and Jamie Vardy, who has retired from international football. For the visitors, Michail Antonio will aim to show that he, too, deserved another England call-up and Declan Rice will attempt to get the better of Nampayls Mendy, whose recent improvement has helped Leicester to tolerate the absence of Wilfried Ndidi. PD • Leicester v West Ham (Sunday, 12pm) 9) Lookman could give Nuno and Wolves a headache Wolves could hardly have been more off-colour in taking a hiding at West Ham, leading Nuno Espírito Santo to lament “lack of concentration, anxiety and mistakes … no organisation” in their defending. Everyone is allowed a blip, especially one of the Premier League’s most clear-headed outfits, although there is a nagging sense that the departures of Matt Doherty and Diogo Jota – together with Jonny’s long-term injury – have left them weaker than they were a few weeks ago. Fulham may not appear very well placed to expose the relative chaos, having begun the season disastrously and shown little aptitude at either end of the pitch. They may have pulled off a masterstroke in signing Ademola Lookman on loan, however. The forward rarely got a look in at RB Leipzig and found Julian Nagelsmann’s exacting demands tricky to plug into; he should stand out in a relegation-threatened side, though, and has the ability to conjure the danger from nothing that Fulham require in the absence of any real cohesion. If he makes his league debut at Molineux, Nuno may need Wolves’ usual steely focus to return quickly. NA • Wolves v Fulham (Sunday, 2pm) 10) Will Djenepo get to keep role for Saints? When Moussa Djenepo scored a stunning solo goal to beat Sheffield United on his first start for Southampton, the talent of the Malian was there for all to see. But it has been a difficult year for Djenepo, who lost his mother in February, struggled to adapt to a different lifestyle and culture, and saw injuries limit his involvement on the pitch. The 22-year-old is now finding his feet: he speaks good English and plays darts with Jack Stephens at the training ground, where he can often be found dancing or playing the piano. Confidence is also high on the pitch after the win over Burnley but with Nathan Redmond fit again for the visit of West Brom, Ralph Hasenhüttl has a decision to make on the wing. Djenepo should be given the chance to showcase his enormous talent again. MB • Southampton v West Brom (Sunday, 12pm)
5	The consumer group Which? has called on the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to introduce a single, robust, dispute resolution service after concluding that passenger rights have been “ripped up by airlines consistently flouting the law”. Responding to a CAA consultation on potential changes to its alternative dispute resolution (ADR) policy, the consumer group said the regulator’s current proposals would lead to even less trust being placed in the already beleaguered travel industry. Which? has repeatedly heard from passengers who have been let down by the convoluted ADR process, after flights were cancelled, delayed or failed to arrive at the airport as planned. The ADR process, which is operated by two private companies and overseen by the CAA, is supposed to arbitrate disputes between airlines and customers seeking compensation as per the law. Which? said passengers frequently had to battle for over a year to receive compensation they were due. Others have had to pay claims management companies to challenge the airlines after the ADR scheme failed them, in some cases losing nearly half the compensation they were due in fees. The CAA has proposed changes to the dispute schemes that would include a new process for “complex and novel” cases that Which? fears would give airlines undue influence over how future cases are handled. The consumer group said the proposal appeared to prioritise the airlines’ perspectives over passengers’ rights, and risked the already weak consumer protections being further diluted. Which? cited the case of Ryanair, which was told to pay £2.6m to passengers whose flights were cancelled by strikes in 2018. Rather than pay up, it simply quit the Aviation ADR scheme, potentially saving millions in unpaid compensation. Due to its limited enforcement powers, the CAA was unable to penalise Ryanair. The regulator took legal action, but almost two years on passengers are no nearer getting the compensation they are owed. Rory Boland, the editor of Which? Travel, said: “Throughout the coronavirus crisis, passengers have seen their consumer rights ripped up by some airlines that have consistently flouted the law – but they have found there is nowhere to turn for support. This situation has only served to highlight that the current complaints system is broken, and tinkering around the edges will not be enough to reform it and make it work for passengers. “The government must ensure that passengers’ needs are front and centre in its aviation recovery plan, starting with the introduction of a mandatory, single ombudsman scheme for airlines, as a first step to restoring trust in the sector.” He said he was concerned that allowing airlines a choice between resolution schemes could enable them to game the system by choosing the one they thought would deliver more favourable outcomes. Richard Stephenson, the CAA communications director, said: “The Civil Aviation Authority was a leading force in the creation of the alternative dispute resolution scheme in the UK which has enabled thousands of consumers to receive compensation from airlines. “We have received Which?’s response to our consultation and we will review its proposals for how improvements can be made to the existing arrangements for the benefit of consumers.”
6	MPs have called on the government to legalise e-scooters in the UK and advertise them to car drivers as a greener alternative for short journeys. The cross-party Commons transport select committee said the scooters, which are only legal to use in limited regional trials, should be allowed on British roads. They also called for robust enforcement to stop people using them on pavements, which they said was dangerous and antisocial, and an impediment to pedestrians and people with disabilities. E-scooters are permitted in most European countries but are illegal on public roads in the UK despite their widespread sale and use. Government-backed trials, limited to shared public rental schemes, started in the summer in Middlesbrough, followed by other pilots in the West Midlands, Milton Keynes and Northamptonshire. The committee recommended that privately owned e-scooters should also be permitted, and called on the Department for Transport to encourage their use as an alternative to short car journeys. It cautioned, however, that it would be counterproductive if people switched from more active and healthy forms of travel such as cycling and walking. The Conservative MP Huw Merriman, who chairs the committee, said: “The UK remains the last major European economy where e-scooters are still banned to use anywhere except on private land and their use on UK roads is currently illegal. “E-scooters have the potential to become an exciting and ingenious way to navigate our streets and get from place to place. If this gets people out of the car, reducing congestion and exercising in the open air, then even better.” The UK trials, operated by a range of companies vying for a share of the growing sector, do not suggest such a move would be straightforward. The rollout across Teesside was slowed after widespread complaints about e-scooters being ridden in shopping centres and along a dual carriageway. Coventry’s scheme was halted after only five days last month over misuse of the vehicles. It was announced on Wednesday that Liverpool would be the next city to run a pilot scheme. The committee said the requirement for a driving licence, which is a requirement for people to take part in the trials, should be dropped, and that local authorities should be allowed to determine maximum speeds. Models in the UK trials are capable of a maximum speed of 15.5mph. The AA backed the call for e-scooters to be legalised but said there should be a national speed limit. It said the safest option would be for the vehicles to use cycle paths and for users to be trained before going on public highways. The dangers of e-scooters were highlighted again last week when a second rider’s death in the UK was reported at a coroner’s inquiry. Barrie Howes, 57, died after a crash in Chatham, Kent, when using an e-scooter on a steep hill in July.

9	We’ve launched a new blog at the link below – head there for the latest: Here’s a quick run down of all the latest coronavirus developments across the globe. Covid cases doubled under most local lockdowns in England. Coronavirus cases have doubled in the majority of English cities and towns that are subject to long-term local lockdowns, Guardian analysis has found, amid growing concern that restrictions are confusing and done “on the cheap”. Pandemic risks overwhelming Wisconsin ahead of Trump rallies. Wisconsin, where US president Donald Trump will hold rallies over the weekend, registered a record increase in new Covid-19 cases on Thursday. The 3,000 new recorded infections fanned fears that the sheer number of new patients could overwhelm hospitals. Paris in danger of restaurant shutdown as France records 9% increase in daily infections. Paris is set to be placed on maximum Covid alert from as soon as Monday, a move likely to force the closure of restaurants and bars and impose further restrictions on public life. French authorities reported a daily rise in new COVID-19 cases exceeding 13,000 again on Thursday. Scottish MP Margaret Ferrier suspended for taking train after positive Covid test. An SNP MP has been suspended from her party and faced multiple calls to resign after taking a train from London to Scotland knowing that she had tested positive for Covid-19. Margaret Ferrier, the SNP MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West, apologised unreservedly for major breaches of Covid regulations. Italy has recorded more than 2,000 daily cases for the first time since April. The country registered 2,548 new Covid-19 infections on Thursday, the first time it has exceeded 2,000 cases in a single day since the end of April. Brazil registered 728 additional coronavirus deaths and 36,157 new cases over the last 24 hours, the nation’s health ministry said. The South American country has now registered 144,680 total coronavirus deaths and 4,847,092 total confirmed cases. Brazil has the second worst coronavirus death toll in the world outside the US. Daily deaths and cases have declined significantly in recent weeks, however health professionals are monitoring certain cities for potential second waves. Wisconsin, where US president Donald Trump will hold rallies over the weekend, registered a record increase in new Covid-19 cases on Thursday. The 3,000 new infections reported in Wisconsin fanned fears that the sheer number of new patients could overwhelm hospitals. Florida, which has four times as many people as Wisconsin, reported 2,628 new cases on Thursday. Wisconsin governor Tony Evers issued an emergency order easing licensing rules in a bid to bolster the number of healthcare workers able to deal with the mounting crisis. “Our emergency department has had several instances in the past week where it was past capacity and needed to place patients in beds in the hallways,” Bellin Health, which runs a hospital in Green Bay, Wisconsin, said in a statement. Its intensive care unit has been full, or nearly full, for a week, it said. Dr Ryan Westergaard, chief medical officer at the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, said the state’s outbreak started in younger people and has now spread through the community. “Public gatherings of any kind are dangerous right now, more so than they have been at any time during this epidemic,” he told CNN on Thursday. Signs that the pandemic is getting worse in the Upper Midwest abound. Wisconsin and North Dakota both reported a record number of hospitalised Covid-19 patients on Thursday, while South Dakota also reported a record number of new cases. New cases of Covid-19 rose in 27 out of 50 US states in September compared with August, with an increase of 111% in Wisconsin, according to a Reuters analysis. Texas is already one of the hardest places in America to vote, and Greg Abbott, the Texas governor, on Thursday made it even harder. The announcement from Abbott, a Republican, limits an executive order from July that made it modestly easier for voters to return their ballots during the pandemic. Texas usually only lets voters return their mail-in ballots in person on election day, but Abbott’s July order said voters could return their ballots in person to the election clerk’s office earlier. He also extended early voting by six days. As a result, some of the biggest counties in the state had planned to offer voters multiple places to could drop off their ballots. Harris county, the most populous in the state, planned to let voters return their ballots at 11 of the clerk’s annex offices around the county. Travis county, home of Austin, planned to offer four places to return their ballots. But the move drew backlash within his own party; Republicans sued the governor over the changes. On Thursday, Abbott backtracked on his earlier order and issued a new executive order only allowing counties to offer voters a single place to return their ballots. Abbott’s order also said officials had to let official poll-watchers inspect the process. Abbott’s order quickly drew outcry and accusations of voter suppression. Texas already severely limits mail-in voting to those who are 65 and older, or who meet a select few other requirements. The state has aggressively opposed a slew of lawsuits seeking to ease those restrictions amid the pandemic. Texas has seen massive growth among Hispanic and other minority voters in recent years, and many of the restrictions in place are seen as a blatant effort to preserve white political power. Harris county clerk Chris Hollins said the new proclamation issued by Abbott “will result in widespread confusion and voter suppression”. Congressional Democrats led by house speaker Nancy Pelosi have proposed a $2.2tn package to respond to the pandemic that has killed more than 207,000 Americans and thrown millions out of work. The House scheduled a vote on the partisan relief bill for Thursday evening. Republican president Donald Trump’s negotiating team has suggested a $1.6tn response, and the White House on Thursday dismissed the Democrats’ offer as not serious. Coronavirus cases have doubled in the majority of English cities and towns that are subject to long-term local lockdowns, Guardian analysis has found, amid growing concern that restrictions are confusing and done “on the cheap”. In 11 out of 16 English cities and towns where restrictions were imposed nine weeks ago, the infection rate has at least doubled, with cases in five areas of Greater Manchester rising faster than the England average in that time. In Wigan, cases have risen from seven per 100,000 residents to 102 in that period. Leicester is the only one of the 16 areas to record fewer cases than when the measures were implemented. The findings will raise concerns after Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said the government’s strategy was to limit the virus to regional hotspots. “If everybody follows the guidance, then we could actually contain it within the areas it is [now] in the way that happened to some degree in Italy and Spain,” he said at a press conference on Wednesday. KLM has submitted a plan to restructure operations to the Dutch state, a condition of the €3.4bn ($4bn) package in aid it is receiving to avoid bankruptcy amid the Covid-19 pandemic. In a statement, KLM said the plan includes agreements with all employees, and would cut costs by 15%, as well as reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 50% by 2030. KLM is cutting its workforce by 20%, including 4,500 jobs this year. The first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, has described the actions of an MP who took a train from London to Scotland knowing she had tested positive for Covid-19 as “utterly indefensible”. Margaret Ferrier, the SNP MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West, apologised unreservedly for two major breaches of Covid regulations. Taking to Twitter, Sturgeon said. It’s hard to express just how angry I feel on behalf of people across the country making hard sacrifices every day to help beat COVID. The rules apply to everyone and they’re in place to keep people safe. A lawmaker from Nicola Sturgeon’s ruling Scottish National Party (SNP) has been suspended after travelling home by train from London to Scotland, despite having received a positive test result for Covid-19. Margaret Ferrier was told her test was positive on Monday after she had spoken in Britain’s parliament at Westminster. She said in a statement: On Monday evening I received a positive test result for Covid-19. I travelled home by train on Tuesday morning without seeking advice. This was ... wrong and I am sorry. The SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford said on Twitter he was suspending her, and that Ferrier would refer herself to the police. It is mandatory in England for people to self-isolate if they test positive for the coronavirus, with fines of £1,000 for those who breach the rules. The opposition Labour party’s Scotland spokesman had earlier said the SNP should condemn Ferrier and discipline her. “It can’t be one rule for Margaret Ferrier, and one rule for everyone else,” Ian Murray said on Twitter. The US Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, were still not in agreement on a coronavirus relief package. “I spoke to Speaker Pelosi a few minutes ago, and they are not in an agreement yet, they have a lot of issues of disagreement,” Schumer told reporters. Pelosi and Mnuchin discussed coronavirus aid in a phone call on Thursday but “distance on key areas remain,” a Pelosi spokesman said. “Their conversation will continue this afternoon,” Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, said on Twitter.

Email: jessica.murray@theguardian.com Twitter: @journojess_ More on the worsening coronavirus outbreak in the French capital from our Paris correspondent. France’s health minister, Olivier Véran, has warned that if the Covid-19 situation in Paris does not improve over the weekend, the city could be placed on “maximum alert” and all bars and restaurants ordered to close from Monday. “We have to anticipate this possibility,” Véran said at his weekly press conference, adding that the authorities would be keeping a close eye on the level of coronavirus contaminations over the next 48 hours. The minister said few French areas had escaped the “rapid circulation” of the virus and that several cities were already on heightened alert. In certain major cities – Lille, Lyon, Grenoble, Toulouse and Saint Etienne – the evolution of the virus was too rapid and “worrying”, he added. The situation in Marseille, put on maximum alert last weekend, has improved slightly, as it has in Bordeaux and Nice. Two categories are most affected, the young and healthy “who do not realise” they are contaminated because they have no symptoms or do not think they have symptoms and vulnerable people who are “seriously” ill, Véran said. Of every ten patients in intensive care, three were under 65 years old, he added. The French health ministry has reported 13,970 new cases in the past 24 hours, up from 12,845 new cases on Wednesday. Here’s a summary of the key global coronavirus developments over the past few hours. Restaurants and bars could be closed in Paris from Monday if coronavirus rates do not improve by Sunday. The capital could be placed on “maximum alert”, the health minister, Olivier Véran, at a press conference on Thursday, warning that “we have to anticipate this possibility”. The Turkish government has been criticised for underreporting cases by the country’s medical association. In a press conference on Wednesday, the health minister, Fahrettin Koca, appeared to acknowledge that Turkey did not record cases of Covid-19 that were not symptomatic. Italy has recorded more than 2,000 daily cases for the first time since April. The country registered 2,548 new Covid-19 infections on Thursday, the first time it has exceeded 2,000 cases in a single day since the end of April. Poland is expecting more than 2,000 new cases a day. On Thursday, the country recorded a record 1,927 new cases, while its health minister said he expected daily cases to continue peaking above 2,000 in the next few days. Sweden has recorded its highest daily caseload since June. A total of 752 new cases were recorded on Thursday, its highest daily rise since 30 June when the health agency registered just over 800 new cases. Italy’s prime minister is seeking to extend the country’s state of emergency until January. On Thursday, Giuseppe Conte said he would ask parliament to extend the current state of emergency beyond mid-October to try to avoid the surge in infections being seen in other European countries. Turkey’s top medical association and the main opposition party have criticised a decision by president Erdogan’s government to only publicly disclose new coronavirus cases if the patient is showing symptoms. Members of the Turkish Medical Association (TTB) and of the Republican People’s Party (CHP) said the policy, acknowledged late on Wednesday by the health minister, hid the true scale of the pandemic and was meant to keep the economy moving. In a Wednesday press conference, the health minister, Fahrettin Koca, appeared to acknowledge the government did not publish the full number of daily positive Covid-19 cases when he said it only tallied those who were symptomatic. The TTB, which has warned of government underreporting for months, said its doubts were confirmed. “You have not led a transparent process. You hid the truth. You did not prevent the pandemic from spreading,” it said on Twitter. After a summer dip, Turkey’s official daily coronavirus cases rose in recent months to more than 1,700, matching levels in May, when a partial lockdown was in place. The tally shows cases fell in recent days to roughly 1,400, with 60-70 deaths. Beginning on 29 July, the health ministry began publishing the number of new daily “patients” – which Minister Koca defined as symptomatic – rather than “cases”, that he said showed the total number of new positive tests. While Koca said the government did not disclose asymptomatic cases, he stressed that contact-tracing teams still managed to isolate them and prevent the virus from spreading. “Those in this group are not of primary importance for the pandemic,” he said on Wednesday. France could declare the capital an area of “maximum alert” meaning closure of all restaurants and bars as of Monday if the Covid-19 situation doesn’t improve. The government use three criteria to decide whether a maximum alert can be applied to any territory – including the overall number of infections, the number of cases in vulnerable people and the number of intensive care beds available. Our Paris correspondent, Kim Willsher, has been posting more details on this on Twitter: The rate of positive Covid-19 tests in 20 New York “hot spot” ZIP codes rose to 6.5% from 5.5% the day before, governor Andrew Cuomo told reporters on Thursday. The overall rate in the state was 1.27%, or 1,382 positive tests out of the 109,218 reported on Wednesday, Cuomo said. He encouraged New Yorkers to download a new contact-tracing app created by the state’s health department and called COVID Alert NY on their smartphones. The app will alert users if they have recently been near someone who goes on to test positive for coronavirus. Many of the 20 hot spots include Orthodox Jewish communities, and Cuomo said he had had productive conversations with community leaders about enforcing social distancing measures. “A cluster today can become community spread tomorrow,” Cuomo said on a briefing call with reporters. “These ZIP codes are not hermetically sealed.” He implored local authorities to increase enforcement measures. “If they’re not wearing masks, they should be fined,” Cuomo said. “If you speed in your car, you get a ticket. That’s how it works.” Thousands of Bangladeshi garment workers who lost their jobs due to the coronavirus pandemic are struggling to find work and are at risk of destitution without urgent support, advocates said. At least 70,000 people are estimated to have been laid off after $3.5bn worth of clothing orders were cancelled or suspended and exports plummeted by 84% in April, the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) said. Most of the country’s 4,000 clothing factories, which employ about 4 million people – mostly women – reopened in April after a month-long break to stem the spread of Covid-19. Bangladesh has seen at least 364,900 confirmed cases and 5,250 deaths to date. While factory bosses say the sector has seen a recent uptick – with 90% of cancelled orders reinstated – and is hiring again, activists said demand for jobs outstripped supply and pointed to a lack of alternatives and assistance for fired garment workers. “For every 10 workers who lost their jobs, only one is being hired,” Kalpona Akter, the founder of the Bangladesh Centre for Worker Solidarity, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone. “This is putting the lives of thousands of workers and their families at risk, because they haven’t earned for the last three to four months,” Akter said. With no social security to tide them over, many of the workers have had to leave Dhaka to return to their villages and are now relying on food handouts from local charities, she said. Italy has registered 2,548 new coronavirus infections over the past 24 hours, the first time the country has exceeded 2,000 cases in a single day since the end of April. The health ministry said there were 24 Covid-related deaths on Thursday against 19 the day before – far fewer than at the height of the pandemic in Italy in March and April. Iran reported a new record number of Covid-19 cases on Thursday, with 3,825 infections confirmed in the past 24 hours, according to official statistics. The figure surpasses the previous record single-day case tally of 3,712, reported on September 22. The number of deaths per day linked to the disease has remained stable, according to Iranian authorities. “We have unfortunately lost 211 of our dear compatriots to the Covid-19 illness over the past 24 hours,” health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari said in a press briefing. The new fatalities bring the total number of deaths to 26,380, out of 461,044 cases recorded in the Islamic republic, which has been battling the Middle East’s deadliest outbreak of the novel coronavirus since February. Madrid and its suburbs are preparing to enter a soft lockdown that restricts trips and out of the Spanish capital following a weeks-long political turf fight that experts say has prevented an effective response to the coronavirus in Europe’s latest infection hotspot. The regional president, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, said she would implement new national health regulations that imposed restrictions on movement and business and social activity in large Spanish cities with high infection rates, while Madrid also mounts a legal challenge to the national government order requiring the measures. The White House is backing a $400-per-week pandemic jobless benefit and is dangling the possibility of a Covid-19 relief bill above $1.5tn as last-ditch, pre-election negotiations hit a critical phase Thursday. The offer by the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, on unemployment is higher than many Republicans would like in any potential Covid deal with the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. Significant, possibly unbridgeable hurdles remain. But the talks have gained momentum as the Trump administration presses for an agreement. On Air Force One on Wednesday night, the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, said Trump made an offer that was “extremely generous and certainly above the $1.5tn that has been articulated to date.” Hello everyone. I will be running the Guardian’s live feed while my colleague Amy takes a break. Please do get in touch to share any comments or news tips with me via any of the channels below. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Poland reported a record number of new daily coronavirus infections on Thursday, with 1,967 new cases, while the country’s health minister said he expected daily new cases could continue peaking above 2,000 in the next few days. Over the past week, Poland has recorded more than 1,000 new cases each day. Authorities announced a previous record of 1,587 new infections on Friday. “We have to expect an escalation of the pandemic. Our forecasts show that in the nearest future, I’m talking about the next two weeks, this figure will continue to be in the range of over 1,500, even 2,000 a day,” Poland’s health minister, Adam Niedzielski, told a news conference. New restrictions were announced in the worst-affected areas on Tuesday, with the government saying restaurants and bars would have to close by 10pm. The government also updated on Thursday its list of red and yellow zones – areas that have more cases and therefore tougher restrictions – which will come into effect on Saturday. The zones include the northern cities of Gdansk, Sopot and Gdynia, as well as the city of Szczecin. The deputy health minister, Waldemar Kraska, said that if the situation worsened, further restrictions could be introduced. Since the start of the pandemic, Poland has recorded a total of 93,481 coronavirus infections and 2,543 deaths. Sweden has registered its highest daily Covid caseload since June, with 752 new infections recorded on Thursday, though no new related deaths have been recorded. The Scandinavian country has shunned lockdowns, leaving most schools, restaurants and businesses open throughout the pandemic. Thursday’s rise was the highest since 30 June, when the health agency recorded just over 800 new cases. Sweden’s total Covid-19 death toll is 5,893. Its death rate per capita is several times higher than its Nordic neighbours but lower than countries like Spain, Italy and the UK that opted for lockdowns. The mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, has said infections in Russia’s capital are rising by about 2,000 a day, and ordered employers to transfer at least 30% of staff to remote work. Writing on his blog, Sobyanin said the rate of Covid-19 hospitalisations was also rising by around 5,000 per week. The United Arab Emirates has recorded its highest daily total of coronavirus infections since the start of the outbreak, with 1,158 new cases on Thursday. The Gulf Arab state had also registered a record 1,100 cases in 24 hours on Wednesday. Daily infection numbers have surged over the past two months from 164 on 3 August. Authorities have blamed people’s poor adherence to social distancing measures. The UAE has a high per-capita rate of Covid-19 tests. The country of about 9.9 million people has carried out 9,798,960 tests so far, the government statistics authority says. The UAE’s nationwide tally stands at 95,348 infections and 421 deaths. The government does not disclose where in the seven emirates they occur. Italy’s prime minister is to ask the country’s parliament to extend the state of emergency over the Covid-19 pandemic to the end of January, as the government tries to avoid the surge in cases being seen in other European countries. The state of emergency, which was due to expire in mid-October, gives greater powers to central government, making it easier for officials to bypass bureaucracy in decision-making. On Thursday, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said he would ask parliament to extend it. “We will propose to parliament to extend the state of emergency, probably to the end of January 2021,” Conte said during a visit to Caserta, in southern Italy. Italy, the first European country to experience a major coronavirus outbreak during the spring, managed to curb infections after a strict lockdown between March and May. However, it has the highest Covid-19 death toll in continental Europe, with 35,894 confirmed fatalities. Daily cases have picked up again over the past two months but they remain under 2,000, a fraction of the number in France and Spain, which have been forced to tighten restrictions again in some areas. New figures show there was a 61% increase in positive Covid-19 cases in England in one week of September. The health service’s test and trace service said 31,373 people tested positive for the virus between 17 and 23 September, a 61% increase from the previous week. In a statement, NHS Test and Trace said: Positive cases have been rising steeply over the last 4 weeks with over 4 times as many positive cases identified in the most recent week compared to the end of August.” The figures come as further lockdown measures were announced by the government in parts of northern England where virus rates are soaring. More than 2 million people in Merseyside, Warrington and Teeside will be banned by law from mixing with other households indoors. Malaysia has reported its biggest rise in new Covid-19 cases since 4 June. On Thursday, the country’s health ministry recorded 260 new infections in the past 24 hours, which it said was mostly due to an outbreak in Sabah state on Borneo Island. Malaysia has so far recorded a total of 11,484 cases, including 136 deaths. The jump in new cases came after travel increased to and from Sabah ahead of state elections last Saturday. Over in Athens an outbreak of coronavirus in a nursing home has caused further alarm among health officials, who say they are increasingly concerned by the rising number of cases in the Greek capital, writes Helena Smith, the Guardian’s correspondent in Greece. As many as 45 people in a nursing home in downtown Athens tested positive for the virus with authorities rushing to transfer the infected men and women to hospitals in the city. The operation came after Greece’s top infectious disease expert professor Sotiris Tsiodras told reporters after visiting the care home (double-masked) “things aren’t going well in Athens”. With the exception of three days over the course of the last 10, the caseload of confirmed coronavirus cases has exceeded 300. On Wednesday, the national organisation of public health, EODY, announced infections had risen by 354, bringing the total to 18,475. With 78 people in intensive care, officials have voiced fears of the pressures being placed on the public health system. Serbia is to review records kept since the start of its coronavirus outbreak to check the death toll, after the country’s leading epidemiologist warned of a significant undercount, according to Reuters. “We will do the audit in the most honest way. I believe in the expertise of our people. We never hid anything, and everything we did, we did transparently,” President Aleksandar Vučić said on Thursday. Serbia recorded its first case of coronavirus in early March. According to official data, 33,551 people have been infected and 749 have died after falling ill with Covid-19. But Predrag Kon, a member of the government-appointed crisis staff tasked with combating the disease, said on Tuesday that the real death toll for the capital, Belgrade, was three times higher than the official figure. In an interview with Belgrade-based NewsMax Adria TV, Kon linked the discrepancy, which he said was particularly big in June, with what he described as an inaccurate information system. The Balkan country saw a sharp increase in coronavirus infections before a general election in June and also in July after it eased restrictions imposed in mid-March to curb the spread of Covid-19. Country’s health authorities say the number of infections has receded since August. Unemployment has risen across the single currency zone in Europe for the fifth month in a row, as concerns grow that government support programmes will be unable to keep businesses hit by coronavirus restrictions afloat forever. The jobless rate rose to 8.1% in the 19 countries that use the euro currency in August, up from 7.9% in July, official statistics showed on Thursday, according to the Associated Press. Some 13.2 million people were unemployed and the number of those out of work rose by 251,000. Economists expect a further rise as wage support programmes expire, while an increase in infections in many countries has increased fears that some restrictions on business interaction may have to be re-imposed. Germany, the eurozone’s largest economy, still has about 3.7 million workers on furlough schemes, and has extended support until the end of 2021. National governments have poured in fiscal stimulus in the form of support loans and guarantees for business, while the European Central Bank has launched a €1.35 trillion ($1.57 trillion; £1,23 trillion) monetary stimulus in the form of regular bond purchases with newly printed money through at least the middle of next year. The president of the Madrid region has pushed by against the Spanish government’s plan to place its capital city under confinement, telling authorities, “You cannot lock down everybody,” and vowing to fight the proposal in the courts. The health ministry said late on Wednesday that the central government was overriding regional authorities and would impose a lockdown of the city of over 3 million people and some surrounding towns in the coming days. But Madrid’s regional president, Isabel Diaz Ayuso, rejected the move, saying the committee that took the decision had no legal authority to do so without a consensus. According to Reuters, she said on esRadio: You cannot lock down everybody. I’m sure the Madrid (region) plan is the best: quick tests, quarantines and life goes on. Diaz Ayuso said on Thursday she would challenge the health ministry order in courts amid a widening rift between the Socialist-led central government and conservative-led regional administration on the response to the pandemic. Legally, we are evaluating with lawyers of the region, how we can do things. Madrid has 735 cases per 100,000 people, one of the highest of any region in Europe and double the national rate in the country, which has has recorded 769,188 cases - the highest in Western Europe - and 31,791 deaths. The region has imposed a partial lockdown in 45 mainly poorer areas. Indonesia reported 4,174 new coronavirus infections on Thursday, bringing the total number of cases in the south east Asian country to 291,182, Reuters reports, citing official data. It also reported 116 new deaths from the virus, taking the total number of fatalities to 10,856, the data from Indonesia’s health ministry showed. The government in Turkey has been accused of hiding the true extent of the country’s coronavirus outbreak after the health minister let slip that daily figures only account for patients with symptoms, not all positive cases. In a news conference on Wednesday night, Fahrettin Koca said that since 29 July the count did not include asymptomatic positive cases, the Associated Press reports. He ignored a question about the number of new positive coronavirus cases per day, a key indicator of where the outbreak is headed in any country. “We are talking about people with symptoms. We are giving this as the daily number of patients,” he told reporters. The revelation led to an outcry on social media, with people calling on the government to reveal the true spread of the coronavirus among the population of 83 million. The minister’s admission came after an opposition legislator, Murat Emir, claimed that the true number of daily new infections in Turkey was 19 times higher than the daily figures reported by Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government. Koca denied the claim, insisting that all information published on a table showing Turkey’s daily coronavirus count is correct. Turkey on Wednesday reported 1,391 new coronavirus patients and 65 deaths. Since the pandemic began, Turkey says 318,000 residents have been infected and 8,195 have died. Poland reported a record number of new daily coronavirus infections on Thursday, with the health ministry announcing 1,967 new cases, according to Reuters. It comes as neighbouring Ukraine also reported a record new high in infections, with authorities there registering 4,069 new cases in the past 24 hours. For the past week, Poland has seen more than 1,000 new cases per day. The authorities announced a previous record 1,587 new infections on Friday. Since the start of the pandemic, Poland has recorded 93,481 coronavirus infections with 2,543 deaths in total. Russia confirmed its highest daily tally of new coronavirus cases since June 12 on Thursday as authorities reported 8,945 new infections, pushing the national total to 1,185,231, Reuters reports. The capital, Moscow, the heart of the outbreak earlier this year, registered 2,424 new cases overnight, officials said. Authorities said 169 people had died nationwide in the last 24 hours, bringing the official death toll to 20,891. The UK coronavirus and politics blog with Andrew Sparrow is now live. From now on I’ll be focusing on the latest developments elsewhere in the world, so head on over there to find out about the latest on Liverpool’s impending lockdown, and other developments. The Spanish government has warned the Madrid regional authorities that new measures to halt the spread of Covid-19 are obligatory as political intransigence threatens to undermine efforts to tackle the pandemic in the western European nation hardest hit by the virus, writes Sam Jones, the Guardian’s correspondent in Madrid. On Wednesday, 13 of Spain’s 19 self-governing regions backed a plan to impose partial lockdowns on town and cities, allowing people to enter and exit affected areas only on work, school, or medical grounds, or for other pressing reasons. Under the rules, the limited confinements will be imposed on municipalities of 100,000 people or more: if there are more than 500 cases per 100,000 people; if more than 10% of tests during the previous fortnight are positive, and if the proportion of intensive care unit (ICU) beds occupied by Covid patients is 35% or higher. More than 1.5 million people in Merseyside, north west England, are expected to be banned from mixing in pubs and restaurants under new coronavirus rules due to be announced on Thursday, writes Josh Halliday, the Guardian’s north of England correspondent. Joe Anderson, the mayor of Liverpool, said he expected an announcement on further restrictions for the region on Thursday morning following a meeting chaired by Boris Johnson. He said households were likely to be banned from mixing in public venues, as they have been for 2 million people in the north-east of England. “We’ve already been told there will be restrictions and regulations put in place similar to Newcastle and the north-east, so we expect that, but potentially also the government might introduce even stricter measures so we’ve just got to wait now and see what they announce,” he told BBC Breakfast. Africa is approaching 1.5 million cases of coronavirus across its 54 countries, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control. According to the latest update circulated this morning by the African Union health agency, there have been more than 36,000 deaths from Covid-19 on the continent, while 1.2 million infected patients have recovered. Southern Africa, and particularly South Africa, is the worst affected part of the continent, accounting for the most coronavirus infections and deaths. You can see more coronavirus statistics from the region on the Africa CDC coronavirus dashboard. Ian Sample, the Guardian’s science editor, has written about the study showing that the rate of growth in Covid-19 cases might be slowing. An interim report from a large testing programme for Covid-19 in the community has found signs that the sharp rise in infections has begun to slow in England. The latest round of testing by the Imperial College React-1 study found a high level of infections and noted cases were continuing to rise, but the rate of increase appeared to have come down. Scientists analysed swabs from more than 80,000 people out of a total of 150,000 taken between 18 and 26 September and found infections had risen substantially across all age groups and regions. Millions of people in China are travelling across the country in a bout of “revenge tourism” after almost a year of quarantines, lockdowns and restrictions on their movement, writes Lily Kuo, the Guardian’s Beijing bureau chief. China’s ministry of culture and tourism expects around 550 million residents will make trips within the country during the eight-day public holiday marking both the mid-autumn festival and China’s national day. Photos posted on social media on Tuesday, the first day of the national holiday, showed tourist spots crowded with visitors and train stations busy with harried passengers. On forums, internet users complained that hotels and tickets for tourist sites were sold out or that traffic had made it impossible to move. “Congestion is unavoidable,” one commentator said on Weibo. “It’s best to stay home.” Hotel bookings for popular destinations like Dali and Lijiang in Yunnan province or Sanya in Hainan, an island in the south, doubled according to the travel booking site Qunar. Travel sites have fought for customers with discounts while airlines have added new routes to meet demand. More than 500 scenic locations across the country are giving free admission or discounts to visitors. Joe Anderson, the mayor of Liverpool, has told BBC Breakfast he was expecting an announcement on further restrictions for Merseyside on Thursday morning following a Covid co-ordinating meeting chaired by the prime minister. Anderson said he expected households to be banned from mixing in public venues, as they have been in the North East of England. He said: We’ve already been told there will be restrictions and regulations put in place similar to Newcastle and the North East, so we expect that, but potentially also the Government might introduce even stricter measures so we’ve just got to wait now and see what they announce. Anderson said he believed the Government was considering measures including ensuring that restaurants were taking bookings only. He said measures to restrict travel, in place in parts of Wales, had not been put forward by ministers. He said there were 9,000 schoolchildren self-isolating in the city as well as 500 teachers. He said 20,000 students had also returned to the city which could have contributed to the rise in infection rates. Subsequently, the environment secretary, George Eustice, told BBC Breakfast that a decision had not yet been made on further coronavirus restrictions being put in place in Merseyside. I know that there are some discussions, I understand, that are going on about the situation in Liverpool, but no decisions have been taken yet. It’s not really possible for me to say what they may or may not do since I think there’s currently dialogue between health officials and the local council there. When pressed further, he added: My understanding is a decision hasn’t been made, but I am aware that discussions have been taking place about what further restrictions might be needed, I think particularly around Merseyside and Liverpool. Rolls-Royce, one of the UK companies worst hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, has announced plans to raise billions of pounds to shore up its balance sheet, reports Graeme Wearden on the Guardian’s business blog. The Derby-based jet engine maker is tapping its shareholders for £2bn through a rights issue (in which investors buy new shares at a discounted price). It is also planning to raise another £1bn through a bond offering. Pressure has been building on Rolls-Royce ever since the pandemic began, and countries began imposing flight restrictions and quarantine rules. Demand for new engines has slumped as airlines have cancelled orders. With many planes grounded, RR’s engine servicing business has also had less business. Read all about it, and more, on our business blog, which is just starting up for the day. Black people in the UK are at almost twice the risk of dying from Covid-19 than white people, according to a new study commissioned by the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. Khan is urging the Government to tackle the inequalities which have led to Londoners experiencing a disproportionate impact of Covid-19 after the report highlighted the uneven effect of the pandemic in relation to factors such as ethnicity and gender, the PA Media news agency reports. The report, released on Thursday, was conducted by researchers from the University of Manchester and analysed data from local and national sources to assess the impact of the pandemic on people with characteristics protected by law. It found that black people were 1.9 times more likely to die from Covid-19 than white people, with the disparity partly due to long-standing socio-economic inequalities as well as the over-representation of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people in careers such as health and social care - professions more susceptible to exposure to the virus. It also discovered men were more likely to die from Covid-19, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data, but that women had experienced disproportionate economic, social and psychological impacts, with mothers 47% more likely to have lost or resigned from their jobs than fathers. Khan said the report proved Covid-19 has had a disproportionate impact on “disabled Londoners, people in areas of high deprivation and those from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds”. It is simply not right for ministers to say they will do ‘whatever it takes’ to mitigate the effects of the coronavirus crisis but then stand by as whole sectors of our society find their lives and their livelihoods at risk. I urge ministers to invest in our communities and the organisations supporting those most at risk, to ensure that accessible health guidance is available to all and, as case numbers are rising again, that there is adequate support in place for those who’ve lost their jobs, had their hours cut or been forced to self-isolate. The former UK health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, on Thursday morning said that local lockdowns may have prevented the current second wave of coronavirus infections from taking hold across the country. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Hunt said: I think the evidence from what happened earlier in the year, not just in this country but all over the world, is that acting early, decisively, quickly, is actually the best way to contain the spread of the virus and that’s what I think Chris Whitty and the Prime Minister are saying. One of the things that is often not noted about Italy was the successful way in which they managed to contain the outbreak of the virus in northern Italy, in Lombardy, and avoid it spreading to the rest of the country. Now, we didn’t manage to do that first time round but it just may be that these local lockdowns, although we haven’t seen a big reduction in transmission within those areas, they may just have contained it and stopped it from becoming the national outbreak that we had before. Hunt also said that, as a starting measure, all NHS staff in hotspot areas for Covid-19 infections should be tested on a weekly basis. Hunt, who is now the chairman of the Commons health committee, said ideally all NHS staff across the country should be regularly tested. Asked if he was confused about why more frontline testing was not being carried out, he said: I am puzzled and I know there are some capacity issues. (Professor) Chris Whitty actually moved towards this position somewhat when he said in July that he did agree with routine testing of asymptomatic NHS staff in hotspot areas - I would like it to be everywhere, but he accepted it was the right thing to do in areas where there is growth. But that is not happening. Some of those hospitals are trying really hard to test all their staff using their own laboratories but to do that on a weekly basis, they need support from NHS Test and Trace, they need additional reagents and what we really need is for the Government to say, ‘You need to make this happen at least in areas where there is high prevalence and we will help you if you can’t do it yourself’. Italy is considering extending its state of emergency over the coronavirus until January 31 next year, Reuters cites two national newspapers as saying on Thursday morning. The state of emergency, currently set to expire in mid-October, gives the government greater powers, allowing officials to more easily bypass the bureaucracy that smothers much decision-making in Italy. Il Messagero and Corriere della Sera said a cabinet meeting discussed the issue late on Wednesday. Il Messaggero reported: It is not official yet.. while at first (the government) talked about pushing it back to 31 December, during the meeting (the government) considered going beyond the end of the year, given that the cohabitation with the virus is destined to go on for a long time still. A new high in daily coronavirus cases has been reported by Ukraine, with authorities there registering 4,069 new cases in the past 24 hours. The previous record of 4,027 new cases was reported on Wednesday. The daily tally of coronavirus infections spiked in September above 3,000, prompting the government to extend lockdown measures until the end of October, Reuters reports. Ukraine’s security council said a total of 213,028 cases were registered in Ukraine as of 1 October, with 4,193 deaths. More questions for the prime minister, this time over this father, Stanley, who has been pictured on the front page of the Mirror going into a newsagents without a mask on. BORIS Johnson’s dad is caught shopping without a mask, breaching Covid-19 rules which the PM is enforcing with £200 fines. Stanley, in a high-risk group at 80, said he was “maybe not 100% up to speed”. The Mirror quoted Johnson as saying: I was ‘maybe not 100% up to speed’. but that was my first day back in England after three weeks. So [the rules] may have changed. I’m extremely sorry for the slip-up and urge everybody to follow the rules. The Daily Telegraph this morning reports on how Boris Johnson (who was for many years columnist for the paper, of course) has defied calls from members of his own party to ease coronavirus restrictions. In a riposte to his critics, the Prime Minister told a Downing Street press conference that “no matter how impatient we may be, how fed up we may become, there is only one way of doing this”. It came after Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, said it was time to live “without fear” and many Tory MPs said lockdowns were damaging the economy. Making clear his determination to stick to his plan, Mr Johnson said: “I know some people will think we should give up and let the virus take its course, despite the huge loss of life that would potentially entail. I have to say, I profoundly disagree.” Let’s start with some newspaper front pages. The print edition of the Guardian (go and buy it) is leading with a story on leaked documents which revealed plans by Downing Street to process the claims of asylum seekers in Moldova, Morocco or Papua New Guinea. The documents suggest officials in the Foreign Office have been pushing back against No 10’s proposals to process asylum applications in detention facilities overseas, which have also included the suggestion the centres could be constructed on the south Atlantic islands of Ascension and St Helena. The documents, marked “official” and “sensitive” and produced earlier this month, summarise advice from officials at the Foreign Office, which was asked by Downing Street to “offer advice on possible options for negotiating an offshore asylum processing facility similar to the Australian model in Papua New Guinea and Nauru”. The Times this morning splashes on a similar, but slightly different asylum proposal by No 10, with politicians apparently also considering proposals to keep asylum seekers aboard disused ferries moored off the coast of Britain while their claims are assessed. The Times has no leaked documents to go on, however, its reporters are relying on what they have “been told”. They write: The Times has also been told that the Home Office held discussions about moving migrants to decommissioned oil platforms in the North Sea for processing. The idea was debated at a Whitehall brainstorming session but ministers decided that it was a “no go” and industry experts said it would pose vast logistical and safety difficulties. The plan to move migrants to ships is thought more realistic and is being given serious consideration. It is a favoured option on a list that will be presented to the prime minister. There is also the possibility of building a processing centre on a Scottish island. However, there are concerns that it would be opposed by Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, and by local residents. Hi this is Damien Gayle taking the reins of the liveblog now from London, where the mornings are growing darker and chillier by the day. As usual, I’ll be keeping you abreast of the latest coronavirus-related updates and headlines from around the world (including the UK, until our UK-focused blog fires up in a couple of hours). Do you have any news to share with us? Are there any interesting developments in your part of the world that you think we should post about on this blog? If so, drop me a line, either via email to damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or via Twitter direct message to @damiengayle. That’s it from me today. Over to you, Damien Gayle. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: Major study suggests Covid transmission rate slowing in England. Research conducted by Imperial College London using the results from England’s largest community coronavirus testing programme suggests that the rate of infection has decreased in the country, but that the number of infections has increased “substantially” across age groups and areas of the country. Residents of infection hotspot Madrid are to be barred from leaving except on essential trips under new rules to fight the coronavirus resurgence, Spain’s government said on Wednesday.But regional authorities said the decision had no legal basis, Reuters reports, setting the stage for a political showdown in an area accounting for more than a third of Spain’s 133,604 new cases in the past two weeks. In Australia, the state of Victoria has recorded 15 new cases of coronavirus and two more fatalities, bringing the state’s death toll to 800 and the national figure to 888. South Africa will reopen its borders to all African countries from today while barring tourists from around 50 nations with high infection rates, including Britain, France, India, Russia and the US. The continent’s most industrialised economy shuttered its borders at the start of a strict nationwide lockdown on 27 March to limit the spread of the virus. Cuba lifts lockdown in Havana. Cuba said on Wednesday it was lifting a curfew and partial lockdown in Havana, in place since 1 September to contain a second wave of the new coronavirus. The governor of Havana Reinaldo García Zapata said cases had dropped to an average of 21 per day over the last week for an infection rate of 0.87 in justifying the decision. Stormont’s health minister is to recommend the introduction of further coronavirus restrictions in Northern Ireland, as it recorded its highest number of infections in a 24-hour period - 424 - since the region’s testing regime was expanded, PA Media reports.Northern Ireland’s seven-day cumulative number of cases per 100,000 population has almost doubled to 103.6 from 58.1 in the last week. Germany declares regions in 11 European countries as risk zones. Germany declared regions in 11 European countries to be areas where there was an elevated risk of exposure to the novel coronavirus, while existing warnings about parts of Belgium were extended to cover the entire country. In its list published late on Wednesday, the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases also declared the whole of France with the exception of the Grand Est region to be risk zones, the whole of Iceland, as well as Wales and Northern Ireland to be risk zones.Risk zones were also declared in Estonia, Ireland, Lithuania, Romania, Slovenia, Hungary and Croatia. 34m jobs lost in Latin America. The UN’s International Labour Organization said Wednesday that at least 34 million jobs have been lost in Latin America due to the coronavirus pandemic. Research conducted by Imperial College London using the results from England’s largest community coronavirus testing programme suggests that the rate of infection has decreased in the country, but that the number of infections has increased “substantially” across age groups and areas of the country: Results from swab tests carried out by more than 80,000 people out of a total of 150,000, taken between 18th and 26th September, show that infections have increased substantially across all age groups and areas of the country. The research, led by Imperial College London, estimated that over 1 in 200 people across England have the SARS-CoV-2 virus, or 0.55% of the population, compared to 0.13% in the previous round of testing. The biggest rise in cases was found in those aged over 65, which saw seven times as many cases as previously. A similar increase was found in those aged between 55-64. Young people continued to have the highest rates of infection, with 1 in 100 estimated to have the virus. The reproduction (R) number decreased from 1.7 to 1.1 but with a wide possible range for the recent value of 0.7 to 1.5. This suggests that the rate of new infections has decreased, but an R above 1 would mean cases will continue to rise if current trends continue. The lead author of the study, Professor Paul Elliott, said that the research shows “some early evidence that the growth of new cases may have slowed, suggesting efforts to control the infection are working.” However, he explained, “the prevalence of infection is the highest that we have recorded to date. This reinforces the need for protective measures to limit the spread of the disease and the public’s adherence to these, which will be vital to minimise further significant illness and loss of life from Covid-19.” In Australia, the state of Victoria has recorded 15 new cases of coronavirus and two more fatalities, bringing the state’s death toll to 800 and the national figure to 888, AAP reports. Premier Daniel Andrews on Thursday confirmed the latest victims are women aged in their 70s and 90s. Both are linked to aged care. There are 289 active cases across the state, including 135 aged care residents and staff, 45 health workers and one disability worker. The last time the state had fewer than 300 active cases was June 29. Thirty-eight Victorians are fighting the virus in hospital, including six in intensive care. South Africa will reopen its borders to all African countries from today while barring tourists from around 50 nations with high infection rates, including Britain, France, India, Russia and the US. The continent’s most industrialised economy shuttered its borders at the start of a strict nationwide lockdown on 27 March to limit the spread of the virus. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison says the country will open its border with New Zealand “very soon”. Morrison told Adelaide radio station 5AA on Thursday that Kiwis will soon be allowed to fly into Australia with no requirement to complete a two-week quarantine, but said New Zealand was unlikely to reciprocate immediately. “We’ll be able to move on that very soon,” he said. “New Zealanders being able to travel to Australia – that’s good for Australian tourism.” Morrison said this would also help ease pressure on the international hotel quarantine system that has meant thousands of Australians trapped overseas are unable to return. “[It] frees up more places for Australians to come home,” he said. The prime minister said South Australia and New South Wales would be the first to benefit from new Kiwi travellers, suggesting states insisting on quarantine for domestic travel would not be included in the bubble. “We can’t have New Zealand tourists coming and taking up those quarantine places in those states,” he said. It is unclear if prospective New Zealand tourists would be required to quarantine on their return home, but a fully functional trans-Tasman bubble appears to be some way off: Oscar-winning film directors James Cameron, Clint Eastwood and Martin Scorsese joined forces with movie theatre owners on Wednesday in an appeal for financial help, saying they feared for the future of the industry, Reuters reports. In a letter to the leaders of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, they said the coronavirus pandemic had dealt a devastating blow to movie theatres and that without funds “theatres may not survive the impact of the pandemic.” The letter was signed by more than 70 directors and producers along with the National Association of Theatre Owners, the Directors Guild of America and the Motion Picture Association. The pandemic forced movie theatres to close their doors in mid-March. Big chains including AMC Entertainment and Cineworld Plc’s Regal Cinemas have reopened, with reduced capacity, in many U.S. cities, but not in the biggest markets of Los Angeles and New York City. The letter said that 69% of small and mid-sized movie theatre companies will be forced to file for bankruptcy or close permanently unless help is forthcoming. “Cinemas are an essential industry that represent the best that American talent and creativity have to offer. But now we fear for their future,” the letter said. Others signing the letter included James Bond movie producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, “Wonder Woman” director Patty Jenkins, and action movie director-producer Michael Bay. They asked Congress to redirect unspent funds from the coronavirus aid package passed earlier this year, or enact new proposals that would help movie theatres weather the pandemic. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 2,503 to 291,722, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Thursday. The reported death toll rose by 12 to 9,500, the tally showed. Hundreds of Hondurans formed a caravan headed towards the United States on Wednesday, seeking to improve their living conditions as coronavirus has killed over 2,000 people and paralysed the economy in the Central American nation, local media reported. The migrants, mostly young men and women carrying backpacks and small children, departed from a bus terminal in the northern city of San Pedro Sula headed toward the Guatemalan border, according to local television. Wednesday’s group marks the first caravan to depart Honduras in 2020, as the nation suffers the largest recorded economic decline in its history after six months of strict lockdown measures aimed at slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus, Reuters reports. Cuba said on Wednesday it was lifting a curfew and partial lockdown in Havana, in place since 1 September to contain a second wave of the new coronavirus, Reuters reports. The governor of Havana Reinaldo García Zapata said cases had dropped to an average of 21 per day over the last week for an infection rate of 0.87 in justifying the decision. Most of the Caribbean nation began returning to a new normal months ago, though there have been minor and quickly contained outbreaks of the virus in a few provinces and a new surge is still to be contained in central Ciego de Avila province. Cuba has credited its free community-based health system and strict isolation of the sick and their contacts in preventing the rapid spread of the virus in much of the region. The Communist-run country has reported just 6,000 cases and 122 deaths from Covid-19 to date. More than 90% of those cases were contacts traced through spreaders. Over the next week public transportation will resume in Havana, stores will return to normal schedules, and eateries and other services will reopen at 60% capacity. Schools are scheduled to open in November while airports remain closed. Wearing masks, social distancing and similar measures remain mandatory and violators face stiff fines. Garcia said the city of 2.2 million people, 20% of Cuba*s population, would remain isolated from the rest of the country for now. Podcast: Has Covid-19 turned the clock back on women’s equality? Women seem to be bearing the brunt of the economic fallout and taking on a greater share of domestic work and childcare. Guardian columnist Gaby Hinsliff looks at whether the virus has meant a huge step back for women’s rights: American Airlines and United Airlines, two of the largest US carriers, said they were beginning furloughs of over 32,000 workers on Thursday as hopes faded for a last-minute bailout from Washington, Reuters reports. Both airlines told employees, however, in memos seen by Reuters on Wednesday that they stood ready to reverse the furloughs, which affect about 13% of their workforces before the pandemic, if a deal was reached. Tens of thousands of other employees at those airlines and others including Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines have accepted buyouts or leaves of absence aimed at reducing headcount as carriers battle a health crisis that has upended the global travel industry. US airlines have been pleading for another $25 billion in payroll support to protect jobs for a further six months once the current package, which banned furloughs, expires at midnight EDT. Police in Canada have charged dozens of people and seized millions in assets after discovering that a sprawling mansion north of Toronto was thriving as a underground gambling den while legal casinos were shuttered due to the coronavirus lockdown. York region police announced 74 charges on Wednesday connected to a months-long investigation into illegal gambling operations in Ontario. As well as making 29 arrests, police seized more than $10m in assets, firearms, cash and high-end liquor: Stormont’s health minister is to recommend the introduction of further coronavirus restrictions in Northern Ireland, as it recorded its highest number of infections in a 24-hour period - 424 - since the region’s testing regime was expanded, PA Media reports. Northern Ireland’s seven-day cumulative number of cases per 100,000 population has almost doubled to 103.6 from 58.1 in the last week. Robin Swann said it would be “inconceivable” that the powersharing Executive will not move to announce fresh measures after ministers meet on Thursday. The minister said while a two-week full lockdown - a so-called circuit breaker - would not be introduced on Thursday, he raised the prospect of such a move over the Halloween mid-term break, or potentially even earlier. “We are now looking at a severe crisis full in the face,” he said. “I can’t put this in any more stark terms - a crisis for our health and social care service and for many victims of Covid-19.” Mr Swann added: “I am now more concerned about what lies ahead in the next few months than I have been since becoming health minister.” Households currently cannot meet indoors in Northern Ireland while outdoor social gatherings are limited to six people from no more than two households. An 11pm curfew on pubs and restaurant closing will come into effect on Thursday. Mr Swann hinted that further restrictions could include added limitations on the hospitality sector, on family and community interactions and on individual travel. He said the places where the wearing of face coverings was mandatory may be expanded. The Derry City and Strabane council area of Northern Ireland has one of the highest infection rates of anywhere in the UK – with more than 300 infections per 100,000 people. The UN’s International Labour Organization said Wednesday that at least 34 million jobs have been lost in Latin America due to the coronavirus pandemic. The ILO urged countries in the region to adopt immediate strategies to deal with the problem, AP reports. The count was up from the ILOs previous estimates in early August that 14 million jobs had been lost in the region. The organization’s Director for Latin America and the Caribbean, Vinícius Pinheiro, called it an unprecedented challenge. Pinheiro said the third quarter had brought a recovery in economic activity and, according to preliminary data, a tentative recovery in employment. He said the region faced structural problems like low productivity, income inequality and a large percentage of people working off the books. The ILO figures were based on data from nine countries which account for 80% of the region’s workforce. The ILO lists Latin America and the Caribbean as the worst-hit region in the world in terms of lost working hours, with a drop of 20.9% in the first three quarters of the year, compared to an average of 11.7% worldwide. Residents of infection hotspot Madrid are to be barred from leaving except on essential trips under new rules to fight the coronavirus resurgence, Spain’s government said on Wednesday. But regional authorities said the decision had no legal basis, Reuters reports, setting the stage for a political showdown in an area accounting for more than a third of Spain’s 133,604 new cases in the past two weeks. “Madrid’s health is Spain’s health. Madrid is special,” Health Minister Salvador Illa told a news conference to announce the new regulations, due to come into force in days. The capital city, with more than 3 million people, and nine surrounding municipalities with at least 100,000 inhabitants each, are to see borders closed to outsiders for non-essential visits, the government said. People would be allowed to cross boundaries for work, school, doctors’ visits or shopping, but not for leisure. Other measures include the closure of bars and restaurants at 11 p.m., from a previous curfew of 1 a.m., as well as shutting parks and playgrounds. Social gatherings will be limited to six people. Madrid has 735 cases per 100,000 people, one of the highest of any region in Europe and double Spain’s national rate. Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest from around the world and as always, would be delighted to hear from you wherever you are. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com. Madrid residents are set to be barred from leaving the city except on essential trips under new coronavirus restrictions announced by the Spanish government. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: Experts warn virus is out of control in the UK. British health experts have admitted Covid-19 is out of control in the country as case numbers and hospital admissions rise despite a slew of new restrictions on social gatherings. “Things are definitely heading in the wrong direction,” the UK chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, told a government press conference, as a further 7,108 cases and 71 deaths were reported. Pandemic travel slump may cost 46 million jobs globally. The impact of the coronavirus on travel may cost as many as 46 million jobs globally, according to projections published by an aviation industry group.The Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) predicted that the travel slump and a slow recovery will threaten 4.8 million aviation workers and more than half of the 87.7 million total jobs supported directly or indirectly by the sector, in related leisure industries and supply chains. No clear link between school opening and Covid surge, study finds. Widespread reopening of schools after lockdowns and vacations is generally not linked to rising Covid-19 rates, a study of 191 countries has found, but lockdown closures will leave a 2020 “pandemic learning debt” of 300bn missed school days. The analysis, by the Geneva-based independent educational foundation Insights for Education, said 84% of those 300bn days would be lost by children in poorer countries, and warned that 711 million pupils were still out of school. Young people as diligent about Covid measures as older people, survey finds. Young people are as diligent about coronavirus hygiene routines as their older peers but also more stressed out by the pandemic and willing to give up a higher percentage of their income to stop it, according to a global survey that calls into question the stereotype of feckless youth driving up infection rates. The Italian Senate has been suspended after two members fell ill with Covid-19. Parliamentary activity was suspended after Marco Croatti and Francesco Mollame, from the ruling Five Star Movement, tested positive. The Czech Republic is to enter a state of emergency to control a surge in cases. Earlier, health minister Roman Prymula said the government would call the state of emergency for 30 days, and limit gatherings to 20 people outdoors and 10 people inside for at least the first two weeks.Audiences will also be banned from sports events, while secondary schools will be closed and medical students will be summoned to help in hospitals for at least 14 days as part of the measure.
10	Dele Alli looks set to remain at Tottenham this season after the club rejected a £1.5m loan bid for the England midfielder from Paris Saint-Germain, while Benfica striker Carlos Vinícius is set to join Spurs after the Portuguese club announced that a €3m loan fee had been agreed with a €45m option-to-buy clause. Alli was offered to the French champions last month and has not featured in the Premier League for Spurs since being substituted at half-time against Everton on the opening day. The 24-year-old has made one appearance since, in the Europa League qualifying win over Shkendija in North Macedonia last week. It is understood Tottenham immediately rejected PSG’s offer, with Alli set to remain and fight for his place in Mourinho’s squad. The Spurs manager would not be drawn on Wednesday over whether Alli could be handed an opportunity in Thursday night’s Europa play-off against Maccabi Haifa, although he did praise the player’s reaction to being largely on the sidelines. “I cannot confirm Dele’s playing tomorrow but I cannot confirm he’s not playing,” Mourinho said. “We have still training sessions today, we have still decisions to make. The only thing I can say is he’s being very, very professional. I have only respect for him.” Tottenham are on the verge of bringing Benfica striker Vinícius to the club on loan. The 25-year-old Brazilian is represented by Jorge Mendes’s company, Gestifute. Mourinho is also represented by Mendes. A loan deal with a €45m option to buy has been agreed between the two clubs. When asked last night whether a deal was close, Mourinho said: “No, I want you to ask me that question when it’s confirmed. Nobody told me it’s done so I’m going to respect the player, respect Benfica and wait a little bit more.”
11	I have two sons, aged 10 and 12, and I am unhappily married to a man who feels the same way. For many reasons, including incompatibility, we haven’t been intimate for 10 years. I have a lover, who my husband knows about, who I see every couple of months. My husband sees other people too. I would like to separate and divorce but my sons are horrified at the idea and would rather we stayed together and try to get along. I want to put them first, but I would prefer to divorce as I panic that I will always be married to this man, and I feel trapped. I also deeply care for my lover/partner and want to be able to be with him more than once in a blue moon, and build some sort of life with him. I want to protect my sons and help them grow up with healthy models of relationships, but I fear I will either disrupt their lives and make them unhappy, or warp their ideas of marriage because of the secrecy and compromises of me and their father. Please help. Eleanor says: I think we have a very hard time accepting when the perfect option is off the table. For years I had a fantasy of the perfect morning: wake up at 6am and sit straight down to write. Don’t stop for a shower, cereal, or to look at the phone. I loved it when I started days this way, the few times I managed to. But in truth there were many, many more mornings when I fell down an email black hole instead. All the same, I wouldn’t let go of the fantasy. I wouldn’t allow myself to get a coffee with a friend or take a walk in the dawn light because committing to those things meant admitting out loud that the perfect option just wasn’t going to happen. In reality, this just condemned me to float bitterly between two kinds of unfulfilled hope. I just twiddled my thumbs, neither writing nor walking. You see where this is going: I think in your own way you’re neither writing nor walking. The infrastructure of your life is still set up around an idealised image of the nuclear family. You don’t permit yourself to make alternative arrangements because that would mean admitting that the original ones just aren’t going to happen. You don’t let yourself go to the person you love. When we’re stuck in this kind of float zone we often tell ourselves we can’t possibly make new plans, because then we will be responsible for the death of the old ones. It can be really liberating to realise that those plans are already dead. Maybe you killed them – maybe nobody did – but the only reason we face decisions like this is that the perfect option is already off the table. It’s gone. The question now is what to do in its wake. You say your sons think you should stay. They’re very young, and I think they must be very afraid. They probably have friends with happily married parents, and they don’t know what’s going to happen to theirs. But from what you’ve said here, what they’re afraid of has already happened: their parents already don’t want to be together. This is going to be a source of tremendous grief for them, but it might well be worse to put off that grief or to acquiesce to their anaesthetising hope that you and your husband will “get along”, if only you stay together. Whatever you do, do it deliberately. Don’t condemn yourself or your boys to the paralysis of hoping that the perfect will finally come true. ************************************* Ask us a question Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?

12	Lorilei Storm, an American who has lived in Ireland for the last decade, has signs supporting Joe Biden all over her front yard – not in front of her Dublin flat, however, but the one surrounding her home in the wildly popular Nintendo game Animal Crossing. “Campaign signs aren’t as much of a thing here, so I was really excited to find them in the game – I put up as many as I could,” Storm said. Joe Biden’s presidential campaign has introduced four different official yard signs in Animal Crossing, all of which users can download by scanning QR codes through the Nintendo Switch online app. Animal Crossing has been used for everything from weddings to talk shows and virtual dates as it gained popularity amid global lockdowns due to Covid-19. The addition of campaign material marks a new frontier for the game, and for America’s presidential race. The banners are the latest attempt by the Biden campaign to make virtual inroads with voters at a time when many traditional campaign events are considered unsafe due to Covid-19. While Biden has relied heavily on digital outreach this year, Donald Trump continues to hold in-person rallies, insisting doing so is “very safe” and mocking his opponents for “hiding indoors”. For that same reason, Trump will not be using Animal Crossing to get out the vote, said Samantha Zager, a spokeswoman for his campaign. “This explains everything: Joe Biden thinks he’s campaigning for president of Animal Crossing from his basement,” she said. “The Trump campaign will continue to spend its resources campaigning in the real world with real Americans.” Animal Crossing does not currently feature any Trump-approved signs, but users can theoretically make their own using customization tools in the app. Nintendo did not respond to request for comment. Though many players were thrilled to deck out their lawns in Biden signs, others were upset at Nintendo for allowing politics to enter the escapist bubble that is Animal Crossing, Storm said. “I can totally see where people are coming from and I don’t want to take away from the escapism, but I also respect that some people say these issues are so important they need to cross over to the digital realm,” Storm said. For others, even Biden supporters, the move felt inauthentic. Eran del Castillo, a 25-year-old Animal Crossing player who has spent more than 350 hours on the game, likened the choice to Hillary Clinton’s infamous line in 2016 encouraging people to “Pokemon-Go-to the polls”, which was mocked as an example of the candidate awkwardly attempting to pander to younger voters. “I think right now, a lot of young people who play Animal Crossing have a perception of Biden and Harris as candidates that don’t address a lot of platforms young people care about, like student debt or the federal minimum wage,” del Castillo said. “So it felt like, ‘Hey we aren’t going to address these concerns but here is a code to use in Animal Crossing.’”
13	Underperforming residential aged care facilities have become such a burden on the sector’s regulator that they are limiting its ability to monitor home care services to older Australians. The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission has provided information to the aged care royal commission in which it acknowledges it has fallen short of timelines and budget allocations to ensure standards of home care quality are met. In addition to the demands from residential homes, the watchdog also cites high turnover of staff that assess home care services and the introduction of more thorough “quality standards” as contributing to progress on home care monitoring moving “more slowly than originally planned”. This week, the aged care royal commission has been examining the state of home care service in Australia, hearing the majority of older Australians would prefer to remain in their homes for longer and that the form of care – which is cheaper than residential aged care solutions – should be an urgent priority for the government. Of the $6.59m allocated to the ACQSC in the 2019-20 federal budget to increase visits to home care services and support changes to the framework for home care compliance checks, just $4.372m had been spent by 1 February. Acknowledging the decline in compliance checks on home care, the watchdog cited soaring rates of non-compliance in residential aged care, up from 10.9% in 2018-19 to 22.8% in 2019-20, as a reason for diverting its resources to the residential facilities that “require more active monitoring”. ACQSC also cited “a high level of attrition” of “quality assessors”, including the retirement of a number of experienced assessors and others who changed jobs, illustrating the volatile size of its compliance teams. New standards, which demand assessors spend more time gathering evidence and writing reports of aged care compliance, also contributed to the home care shortfall. The ACQSC said that, given its limited resources, it had been forced to target its checks to areas it believed were at the highest risk of affecting the safety of home care service recipients. Ian Yates, the chief executive of the Council on the Ageing, told Guardian Australia the ACQSC is “not anywhere near as resourced or powerful as we would like”. “Assessing and monitoring quality in-home care is equally important as residential care and needs quite significantly more ongoing resources. “It’s a challenge because you can go into a residential facility and all the residents are there. But monitoring home care, you have to go through a process to organise visits to each home care recipient. “The challenge we all have is how do you convince the consumer that it’s safe to tell the regulator that there’s something going wrong with your provider. The fear is real,” Yates said. Julie Collins, the federal opposition’s aged care spokeswoman, said “the regulator doesn’t have the powers and resources it needs to ensure older Australians are receiving high quality aged care”. “This is just further evidence of this – it is not good enough that there clearly hasn’t been enough oversight of home care. “This is despite more and more older Australians wanting to receive aged care at home. It is particularly concerning this has not happened despite the risks of Covid-19,” she said, noting recent “damning revelations” that the regulator stopped visits during the pandemic. Richard Colbeck, the aged care minister, said “the commission applies a risk-based regulatory approach” and that “risk assessment activities are undertaken continuously to assess the level of risk of home service providers”. He said the government had allocated “a further $9m to support ongoing regulation of the sector” as part of its Covid-19 response. Colbeck has weathered calls to resign from his portfolio, after Labor attacked him for failing to know how many deaths had occurred in aged care during the Covid-19 pandemic. During his opening remarks to the royal commission on Monday, senior counsel assisting, Peter Gray QC, said “there should be far more urgent efforts to prioritise home care over residential care” because “as the research indicates ... [residential care is] not generally the setting a person would choose”. He said Australia had a “very high” share of aged care recipients in residential aged care compared to most other developed countries, noting 19% of citizens over 80 in Australia lived in residential care – the highest percentage in the OECD. At the end of March, 103,599 Australians were waiting for a home care package they had been approved for. The waitlist has shrunk by just 838 places since the end of 2019.
14	This blog is closing down now but you can pick up all the latest updates at our new blog with my colleague Martin Farrer here: Brazil has recorded 42,659 new cases of coronavirus and 1,215 deaths in the past 24 hours, the health ministry said on Tuesday night. Brazil has registered a total 3,950,931 cases of the virus since the pandemic began, while the official death toll from Covid-19 has risen to 122,596, according to ministry data, in the world’s worst coronavirus outbreak outside the US. Here’s a quick recap of the latest coronavirus developments across the globe over the last few hours: Greece added to Scotland’s quarantine list. Travellers from Greece will be required to self-isolate at home for 14 days on arrival in Scotland from Thursday. Hungary closes borders again. The country has resealed its borders, implementing measures even stricter than those at the height of the pandemic in spring. For at least the month of September, the country is closed to almost everyone except Hungarian citizens and residents, and even they must quarantine on arrival. Residential evictions halted in the US on public health grounds. The order, from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, lasts through 31 December and applies to individual renters earning no more than $99,000 in annual income. Greece delays school reopening. Greek authorities have delayed the reopening of schools by a week to 14 September because of a surge in Covid-19 infections, the government has said. United Arab Emirates records over 500 new Covid-19 infections for second successive day. The government’s communications office said there had been 574 new infections but no deaths in the previous 24 hours, following 541 new infections and two deaths reported on Monday. Holidaymakers returning to Wales from Zante asked to quarantine. Health and social services minister Vaughan Gething said public officials had identified “multiple separate clusters” linked to the popular holiday island. Household gatherings banned in parts of Greater Glasgow, Scotland. First minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced a ban on household gatherings in three local authorities in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area for the next two weeks after a surge in coronavirus cases. That’s all from me Jessica Murray, I’m now handing over to my colleague Martin Farrer. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued an order temporarily halting residential evictions on public health grounds. The order lasts through 31 December and applies to individual renters earning no more than $99,000 in annual income. The CDC said an eviction moratorium “can be an effective public health measure utilized to prevent the spread of communicable disease” like Covid-19. Renters still owe rent and the order does not prevent the “charging or collecting of fees, penalties, or interest as a result of the failure to pay rent or other housing payment on a timely basis,” the CDC said. US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin told a US House of Representatives panel earlier the measure was to ensure people “don’t get thrown out of their rental homes” as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Mnuchin said the actions affect about 40 million renters. He said Congress should still approve rental assistance. In July, a firm estimated more than $21.5bn in past-due rent is owed by Americans. Over the spring and early summer, as unemployment surged to levels unseen since the aftermath of the 1930s Great Depression, a patchwork of federal, state and local eviction bans kept renters who could not make payments in homes. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill in May that would extend enhanced jobless aid through January and allocated $100bn for rental assistance. It would also have extended the federal ban on evictions for up to one year. The bill has not been approved in the Senate. Following the science on coronavirus was not enough to ensure the right decisions were made at the right time and the UK government should have better understood the limits of advice, a thinktank has said. A report by the Institute for Government into the first responses to the pandemic concluded that ministers should have been prepared to act in the “absence of scientific certainty”. The IfG also criticised the government’s ambition to reach 100,000 tests per day by the end of April, saying it had not been well thought through as the diagnostics industry and the NHS were not consulted before the decision was made. It said the government “lacked a wider sense of strategy” at times, and accused the health secretary, Matt Hancock, of making the testing commitment “without a strong enough sense of how the government would use additional capacity”. A government spokesman defended the response to the crisis, saying ministers “make no apology for being guided by the best scientific advice”. The IfG report said: Ministers made much of ‘following the science’. But it is not enough to use evidence: ministers and civil servants also need to understand the limitations of both the evidence base and the forums through which it is channelled, and, difficult as it might be, ministers must be prepared to act in the absence of scientific certainty. Failure to do so now seems likely to have cost a significant number of additional lives, and contributed to the UK suffering the highest excess death rate in Europe over the period to the end of May. The IfG also said that while school closures and social distancing measures were contemplated in February, some “key aspects of making them work – like remote learning arrangements for schools and guidance for police – were not considered until after decisions had been made”. However, the report praised the successful rollout of economic support measures, which the IfG said showed that ministers and officials “can find fast ways to consult those who will be affected by a policy or programme and think through how it will be carried out, before making a decision”. Alex Thomas, programme director at the IfG, said: The best decisions are made when the government knows not just what it wants to do, but why it wants to do it. At times, during its early response to the pandemic, the government lacked a wider sense of strategy. Greater focus on why it was taking decisions – ultimately to save lives – would have led to better outcomes all round. A government spokesman said: “We make no apology for being guided by the best scientific advice during this unprecedented global pandemic – as the public would expect. “We keep our response under constant review and have been prepared to adapt as new evidence emerges and we learn more about this virus. “Working closely with the public and private sectors we rapidly built the largest diagnostics infrastructure in British history.” The suggestion made by a leading doctor that Covid-19 could “fizzle out” has been criticised by other experts. Prof Karol Sikora, dean of medicine at the University of Buckingham, said there were three potential outcomes for the outbreak, when he appeared on the BBC’s Politics Live on Tuesday. Sikora, a leading oncologist and former chief of the World Health Organization’s cancer programme, said: Number one is what we all want, the thing just fizzles out, it causes very few deaths, very few hospitalisations, nobody gets really ill, and it just gradually drifts into that sort of hinterland of a chronic viral infection, sits in the population and bubbles up now and again without too much problem, just like the flu, just like the common cold. The second outcome is local spikes and the third outcome is full-blown second wave, we genuinely don’t know what’s going to happen. I think, being positive about it, it’s got to be the first one, but there are other scenarios that we have to plan for, that’s the problem. Sikora later said both human behaviour and the virus had changed during the pandemic. He added: “It’s probably changed again, it wants to live with us, that’s the problem, it wants to actually be nice to us and go on forever living with us, and killing us is not a good way to start a relationship. “It is trying to change, we’ve certainly changed – what we’ve heard about the schools trying to implement handwashing, social distancing, all the other things – that’s a change in our behaviour and that will drive the infection down. “What the outcome is now, with local spikes, or second wave, or just fizzling out we have to see, but I’m the fizzling out brigade, I must say. “It seems likely to me that the lack of hospitalisations is really good news.” Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said the Covid-19 pandemic is accelerating globally: It would be very dangerous to promote the idea that the virus is ‘fizzling out’. In the most recent (World Health Organization) situation report, there were 1.8 million confirmed new Covid-19 cases, an increase in the number of new cases from the week before, and bringing the total number of cases over the last six months to more than 25 million. We are a long way from being anywhere near the concept of being able to say that Covid-19 is ‘fizzling out’. Addressing Sikora’s discussion of how the virus had changed, Dr Stephen Griffin, associate professor in the School of Medicine at the University of Leeds, said it was “flawed” to think the coronavirus had become less pathogenic. He said: Whilst the virus genome drifts gradually in sequence and some changes have become widespread, there is no evidence to suggest that the virus is in any way attenuated. Whilst the number of deaths and hospitalisations has lessened in the UK, this is proportionate to case numbers and heavily influenced by the changes to patient demographics. Overall, the rise and fall in cases correlates with non-pharmaceutical interventions, falling when they are implemented and potentially rising again when they are relaxed unless community transmission is halted. This is not fizzling out in any sense. Minimising the seriousness of this disease risks resurgence on a troubling scale. The US government will send an “overwhelming majority” of the rapid Covid-19 tests it purchased from Abbott Laboratories last week to governors of states and territories to support school reopenings and other critical tasks. Other top priorities for the newly purchased tests include day care centres, first responders, and “critical infrastructure,” said Admiral Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health at the US Department of Health and Human Services. The tests will be distributed in collaboration with Abbott beginning in mid-September, Giroir said. Abbott said last week it will ramp up production to around 50m tests per month by mid-October. The US government agreed to purchase 150m rapid antigen tests for Covid-19 from Abbott in a roughly $750m deal. The portable tests can deliver results within 15 minutes and will sell for $5. They require no additional equipment, and can use a less invasive nasal swab than traditional lab tests. Antigen tests are cheaper and faster than molecular diagnostic tests, but somewhat more likely to fail to identify positive cases of the virus than lab-based diagnostic tests. President Donald Trump has repeatedly pushed for schools to reopen, but most of the largest US school districts have said they would start the school year with online classes. Giroir also said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) still supports testing asymptomatic individuals for Covid-19 who are prioritised by local health officials or in high risk populations. Last week, the CDC sparked outcry among many public health officials when it said testing some asymptomatic people may not be necessary. The United States has conducted 85m Covid-19 tests so far with a positivity rate of just over 5%, Giroir said. The mean turnaround time is 2.27 days. The White House has pushed back on concerns expressed by the World Health Organization after a US health official said a coronavirus vaccine might be approved without completing full trials. White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement: The United States will continue to engage our international partners to ensure we defeat this virus, but we will not be constrained by multilateral organizations influenced by the corrupt World Health Organization and China. This President will spare no expense to ensure that any new vaccine maintains our own FDA’s gold standard for safety and efficacy, is thoroughly tested, and saves lives. Cycling is undergoing a renaissance in the congested Mexico City, North America’s largest metropolis and home to over 20 million, as residents seek to social distance and avoid public transport amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. A chaotic network of metro trains and buses form the backbone of the city’s public transport system and was used on a daily basis prior to the pandemic by millions of commuters, often cramped elbow to elbow. “Many people have opted to buy a bike and use it, out of fear of public transport, to get to work, to go out and about, to be active,” said Valentin Najjera, a bike shop owner. He says business is booming. “There has been an increase in sales since the pandemic.” Mexico City’s local government has taken notice of the shift and implemented new urban planning projects, including a recent announcement for more than 40 miles (64km) of exclusive bike lanes. While city dwellers around the world take some consolation in improved air quality thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, pollution from diesel-fuelled generators and nearby fossil fuel power plants, as well as frequent forest fires, has ensured Mexico City remains smog-filled. The United Arab Emirates has recorded over 500 new Covid-19 infections for the second successive day, after a rise in cases in the Middle East financial hub. The government’s communications office said on Twitter there had been 574 new infections but no deaths in the previous 24 hours, following 541 new infections and two deaths reported on Monday. Schools in the UAE reopened this week, though some will continue with only remote learning after suspected cases among employees, state news agency WAM reported, citing the education ministry. Daily infections are at their highest since 683 cases were recorded on 5 July. There have been periodic spikes in cases since daily infections peaked in May. Businesses and public venues have reopened since a nationwide curfew was lifted on 24 June, and tourism hub Dubai reopened to foreign visitors on 7 July. A government official said last month a curfew could be reinstated if there were a high number of infections. The UAE has recorded 70,805 infections and 384 deaths from the coronavirus. The government does not disclose where in the country of seven emirates, or states, the infections or deaths occurred. Holidaymakers returning to Wales from the Greek island of Zante are to be asked to quarantine for 14 days and be offered Covid-19 tests, the Welsh government has said. Health and social services minister Vaughan Gething said public officials had identified “multiple separate clusters” linked to the popular holiday island. The first Tui flight affected will land tonight at Cardiff international airport and passengers will be given a letter asking them to self-isolate for two weeks. They will also be offered a coronavirus test within 48 hours of their arrival home and a repeat test eight days after returning. Gething said he was also asking for a meeting with the UK government and the other devolved nations to discuss further measures. He said: There are currently six clusters amounting to over 30 cases in the last week from four flights, of which two of these flights landed in England. There are concerns from our public health teams that the current advice and control measures for returning travellers are insufficient. It is almost certain that travellers returning to Wales from areas of higher Covid-19 incidence will lead to further seeding of infections within Wales. Travel into Wales from mainland Europe drove the first wave of Covid-19. There is an obvious need for us to consider the potential for changes to the regulations in Wales which would require travellers arriving in the UK from Greece and possibly elsewhere to self-isolate on their return. This is a dynamic situation and I will continue to review what measures may be required in the future. The new measures follow reports that passengers on a flight from Zante to Cardiff last week did not adhere to coronavirus rules. Public Health Wales has confirmed at least 16 cases of Covid-19 from three different parties who were on Tui flight 6215 to Cardiff on 25 August. Seven of those were infectious at the time of flying and all 193 passengers have been told to self-isolate, it said. One traveller claimed that the flight was full of “selfish ‘covidiots”’, with passengers not wearing their masks properly and disregarding the rules. On Tuesday, Public Health Wales said one further person with coronavirus had died in Wales, bringing the total number of deaths there to 1,596. There were a further 51 positive cases of Covid-19 reported, bringing the number of cases to 18,063. Travellers from Greece will be required to self-isolate at home for 14 days on arrival in Scotland from Thursday. It comes after a significant rise in cases of coronavirus being imported from the Mediterranean country, the Scottish government said The measures will come into effect at 4am on Thursday. Scottish justice secretary, Humza Yousaf, said: We are in the midst of a global pandemic and the situation in many countries can change suddenly. Therefore, people should think very hard before committing to non-essential travel abroad. With Scotland’s relatively low infection rate, importation of new cases from Greece is a significant risk to public health. We continue to closely monitor the situation in all parts of the world and base the decisions we make on the scientific evidence available. Regular discussions continue with the other three governments in the UK. Requiring travellers arriving from a non-exempt country to quarantine for 14 days on arrival is vital to helping prevent transmission of the virus and to suppress it. The Scottish government said evidence of virus importation, especially from the Greek islands, has led to the country being removed from the exemption list on public health grounds. It is believed prevalence of Covid-19 in Greece remains lower than 20 per 100,000, but a number of cases in Scotland can be traced back to travel to the Mediterranean country. Countries tend to be added to the quarantine list when the figure rises above 20 per 100,000. Scotland’s chief medical officer, Gregor Smith, said: There is a compelling public health risk around importation of the virus, especially given the number of imported cases linked to the Greek islands. The flow of travel between Scotland and Greece, and the behaviour we have seen from some of those travellers, means that on public health grounds there is a strong case - supported by public health directors - to remove Greece from the exemption list. All international travellers coming into Scotland, apart from a very limited number of individual exemptions, must complete a passenger locator form. Those who do not complete it and present it when asked on arrival may be fined £60. This can be doubled for each subsequent offence up to a maximum of £480. Failure to comply with the requirement to quarantine may result in a fine of £480. The morning flow of commuters arriving at Canary Wharf, London’s financial district, was a trickle on Tuesday rather than the torrent traditionally associated with the end of summer return to work. Sparse numbers of suited and smartly dressed workers emerged from the underground station, clutching their morning takeaway coffees, destined for the corporate headquarters of banks, financial services companies and law firms. It was, however, busier than it has been. “There were bigger numbers of people on the tube today,” said Gogoro Nwinia, an estate agent at LiFE Residential, who felt his morning commute was the busiest he had experienced since he returned to the office in early July. The Canary Wharf Group, which owns the private estate in east London, is expecting more workers to return in September, but declined to speculate on numbers. In July, it was estimated that under 10% of the 120,000 workers based in the area had returned to their desks, and the group’s executive chairman, Sir George Iacobescu, has called on businesses to return. UK office workers have been far slower to return to their desks, than their European counterparts, according to analysis from US bank Morgan Stanley’s research unit AlphaWise. Latest figures show that just over a third (37%) of white-collar workers in the UK are back at the office, compared with over three-quarters of employees in Germany, Italy and Spain, and 84% in France. Zimbabwe will reopen primary and secondary schools this month for students preparing to sit their final exams, six months after they were closed due to the Covid-19 outbreak. The first students to return, on 14 September, will be those taking Cambridge International exams. Those taking locally administered final exams will go back two weeks later. “The ministry [of education] is working closely with other ministries and stakeholders to guarantee the safety of pupils and staff during the examinations period,” the government said. The education ministry had previously said it would give priority to pupils taking final exams and has hinted that other students will not return to school until 2021. Zimbabwe has recorded about 6,500 cases of Covid-19 and 202 deaths. Despite an increase in infections in the past six weeks, most cases were mild to moderate, with a recovery rate of about 80%, the government said. Authorities are also looking at reopening airports to support the tourism sector, the government said. The plan is to start with the resumption of domestic flights and then to restart international flights, it added, but did not give a date. Nicola Sturgeon has announced a ban on household gatherings in three local authorities in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area for the next two weeks after a surge in coronavirus cases. Scotland’s first minister said the localised restrictions, which come into force at midnight tonight and will affect an estimated 800,ooo people, apply to those living in West Dunbartonshire, Glasgow and East Renfrewshire, where infection rates have risen in recent days. Those resident in these three areas should not host people in their homes or visit someone else’s home, regardless of where they live. The only exception will be those “extended households”, that were established during lockdown where people who lived alone, couples who don’t live together, or single parents could join with one other household to provide mutual support. Hi everyone, this is Jessica Murray, I’ll be running the coronavirus liveblog for the next few hours. Feel free to get in touch with any story tips or personal experiences you would like to share. Email: jessica.murray@theguardian.com Twitter: @journojess_ Spain recorded 8,115 new cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday evening, 2,731 of them diagnosed in the previous 24 hours, according to the latest figures from the national health ministry. The latest statistics bring the country’s total to 470,973 cases, of which 99,889 have been logged over the past fortnight. Over the past seven days, 159 people have died from the virus, bringing the death toll to 29,152. Cuban authorities launched a strict 15-day lockdown of Havana on Tuesday in order to stamp out the low level but persistent spread of coronavirus in the capital. Aggressive anti-virus measures, including closing down air travel, have virtually eliminated Covid-19 in Cuba with the exception of the capital, where cases have increased from a handful a day to dozens daily over the last month. Starting Tuesday, Havana is under a 7pm to 5am curfew. Most stores are barred from selling to shoppers from outside the immediate neighbourhood to prevent people from moving around the city. Gas stations cannot sell gas to privately owned vehicles, another measure meant to reduce mobility. Police stationed on every road leaving Havana are charged with stopping everyone who doesn’t have a special travel permit, meant to be issued only in extraordinary circumstances. Some provinces that have had no new cases for weeks have detected them in recent days, often linked to travellers from Havana. The start of the school year is also indefinitely delayed in Havana, even as schools open in the rest of Cuba. Madrid’s city council has announced that the capital’s 3,800 parks and green spaces will be closed from 10pm until 6am in a move to halt the spread of the virus. The measure will come into force immediately. Police in Madrid are also cracking down on botellones, or street drinking parties, which can facilitate the spread of the virus. The Madrid region has accounted for about a third of the 96,000 infections recorded in Spain over the past two weeks. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador defended his handling of the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic on Tuesday, arguing in a major speech that the economy has fared better than some of its peers. The pandemic lockdown threw Mexico’s economy, Latin America’s second largest, into the deepest slump since the Great Depression, shrinking 17% in the second quarter. “The economy’s contraction, despite the global disaster, was 10.4% during the first half of the year. But despite the collapse the damage was smaller than in Italy, Spain, France and the United Kingdom,” López Obrador said in his state of the union address from the ornate national palace. López Obrador has resisted pressure to borrow to support the economy or bail out companies on the brink of collapse, while picking fights with some businesses. “We have faced the pandemic and we are going to get out of the economic crisis without taking on additional external debt and without allocating public money to immoral bailouts,” he said. In contrast, Brazil’s economy contracted 9.7% in the second quarter as its government launched a spending program to cushion the pandemic’s impact. López Obrador has forecast that the economy will follow a V-shaped trajectory, meaning a sharp slump followed by an equally sharp recovery. “Fortunately this is happening, the worst is over and now we are recovering. Lost jobs are already recovering, production is slowly returning to normal and we are already beginning to grow,” he said. The French health ministry has reported 4,982 new confirmed coronavirus cases, up on the 3,082 reported on Monday, but below the highs of nearly 7,400 seen last week. The number of people who have died from Covid-19 infections increased by 26 to 30,661, and the cumulative number of cases now totals 286,007. Colombia’s lockdown has been lifted, with highways and domestic airports across the South American nation opening for the first time since coronavirus restrictions were announced over five months ago. The lockdown, like others across Latin America, was among the longest in the world. Leaders across the planet’s most unequal region shut their economies down in late March, in some cases when only a handful of cases had been confirmed. At the time, many were watching the collapse of health infrastructure in Italy and Spain. On Tuesday many Colombians celebrated their regained freedom while calling on each other to continue to follow health guidelines, which include wearing a mask in public and maintaining social distancing where possible. “The lockdown is over!” one person wrote on Twitter, echoing the sentiments of many others on the platform. “God be with us for this next stage.” Another cautioned: “Quarantine is over but not the pandemic … please we must take care of one another.” President Ivan Duque offered similar warnings in a televised address on Monday night, ahead of loosening restrictions. “We must be clear that the virus has not gone away, not here nor anywhere in the world, and for that reason we can’t let our guard down,” Duque said. Though restrictions have been loosened, Colombia continues to be rattled by the coronavirus. The country has confirmed 615,168 cases of Covid-19, while the confirmed death total will likely pass the grim milestone of 20,000 by Wednesday night. Some restrictions, such as the closure of gyms and places of worship, will continue in cities where the infection rate is high, including Bogotá, the capital, which has borne the brunt of Colombia’s outbreak. Others, such as second city Medellín, will see restaurants reopen. Greek authorities have delayed the reopening of schools by a week to 14 September because of a surge in Covid-19 infections, the government has said. The rise in coronavirus cases in recent weeks has forced Greek authorities to gradually reimpose restrictions to curb the spread of Covid-19, during the peak tourism season. The capital Athens and many popular islands have been affected. Government spokesman Stelios Petsas said the extension was necessary for families to return to big cities from summer vacations and spend some time at home before children get back to class. “We urge all parents to return with the children to their homes in the coming days and to make sure they stay safe ... until lessons resume,” Petsas said. Mask wearing will be mandatory in all indoor spaces of schools across the country. Greece has reported 207 new Covid-19 infections since Monday, raising the total number to 10,524. It has recorded a total of 271 Covid-related deaths, including five since Monday. Amazon owned Whole Foods Market, has opened its first delivery-only store in Brooklyn, New York, as the e-commerce giant looks to take greater advantage of a coronavirus-induced surge in online grocery shopping. Amazon said it had hired hundreds of employees to work at the new store, which will deliver to customers only in the Brooklyn area. Afraid to step out of home during the pandemic, people are using their phones and computers to order bread, milk, vegetables and daily household essentials. This has boosted online business of retailers such as Walmart Inc and Target Corp. Grocery delivery is one of the fastest-growing businesses at Amazon, with online sales tripling in the second quarter this year. The company bought Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion. In the US, public tours of the White House, halted nearly six months ago because of the coronavirus outbreak, are to resume later this month with new health and safety policies in place. Tours will begin again on 12 September, for two days a week instead of five, and for just a few hours a day, the first lady’s office has announced. The number of visitors will also be capped. In order to ensure the safety and health of all visitors, there have been new policies implemented that align with the guidance issued by federal, state, and local officials, the White House said. All guests over the age of two will be required to wear a face covering and practice social distancing. Social distancing dots will be placed on the ground to guide guests during check-in, and hand sanitizer will be available in multiple locations. National Park Service workers, US Secret Service officers and staff from the White House visitors office along the tour route will wear face coverings and gloves, and encourage social distancing while interacting with guests. Hungary has resealed its borders, implementing measures even stricter than those at the height of the pandemic in spring. For at least the month of September, the country is closed to almost everyone except Hungarian citizens and residents, and even they must quarantine on arrival. Previously, Hungary had a series of travel corridors with “green” EU countries, and the country’s tourism sector had begun to pick up in recent weeks. Hungary has done better than many European countries at controlling the virus, with a total of just 6,257 cases as of Tuesday. However, new daily cases have risen from just a handful each day earlier in August to more than 100 a day over the past week. Announcing the move over the weekend, prime minister Viktor Orbán said a second coronavirus wave is “knocking on the door” and that preventing it calls for “serious measures”. On Monday, the country made an exception for citizens of three other central European countries providing they have a negative coronavirus test. Citizens of all other countries cannot enter even if they have negative tests and are prepared to quarantine. The move drew criticism from Brussels, where politicians have been moving away from blanket border closures towards more targeted travel bans combined with contact tracing. Some saw it as the latest in a series of attempts by Orbán to blame foreigners or migrants for Hungary’s troubles. “Maybe Mr Orban should consider if he wants to be a member of the EU. If you are a member of a team, you play by the rules,” Dutch MEP Sophie in’ t Veld told Euronews. A person on a poorly ventilated Chinese bus infected nearly two dozen other passengers with coronavirus even though many weren’t sitting close by, according to research that offers fresh evidence the disease can spread in the air. Health authorities had initially discounted the possibility that simply breathing could send infectious micro-droplets into the air, but did a U-turn as experts piled on pressure and evidence mounted. The article published Tuesday in JAMA Internal Medicine explores the threat of airborne infection by taking a close look at passengers who made a 50-minute trip to a Buddhist event in the eastern Chinese city of Ningbo aboard two buses in January before face masks became routine against the virus. Researchers believe a passenger, whose gender was not identified, was likely patient zero because the person had been in contact with people from Wuhan, the city where the contagion emerged late last year. The scientists managed to map out where the other passengers sat, and also test them for the virus, with 23 of 68 passengers subsequently confirmed as infected on the same bus. What is notable is that the sickness infected people in the front and back of the bus, outside the perimeter of 1-2 metres that authorities and experts say infectious droplets can travel. On top of that, the sick passenger was not yet showing symptoms of the disease, such as a cough, when the group made their trip to a religious event. Researchers also noted the airconditioning simply recirculated the air inside the bus, which likely contributed to spreading of the virus.

Thanks Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com New York City public schools, the largest US school system, will delay the start of classes by 11 days to 21 September, under an agreement with education unions that had pushed for additional coronavirus safety measures, the city’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, has said. Fears within the travel industry are growing that Britain will reimpose a quarantine for people travelling from Portugal, as coronavirus cases in the country fluctuate. Reuters reports: It has been less than two weeks since Britain, Portugal’s leading source of tourism, lifted a 14-day self-isolation rule for travellers arriving from Portugal. The announcement was a relief for the tourism sector, which struggled as restrictions kept visitors away over the summer. The number of passengers arriving from Britain has grown by 190% since Portugal was removed from Britain’s quarantine list. But a steady count of several hundred new cases per day over the last week raised fears Britain would put Portugal back on the list. Last Thursday, health authorities reported 401 new infections, the highest since early July. Cases have since dropped, with 231 on Tuesday, bringing the total to 58,243. British ambassador Chris Sainty said on Monday the embassy has been working closely with Portuguese authorities to understand the situation but “things can change quickly”. He tweeted: British media reports said the number of daily cases in Portugal meant it may be forced back on to the quarantine list. A spokesman for the prime minister, Boris Johnson, declined to comment. Eliderico Viegas president of Algarve’s AHETA hotel association said he was worried about the prospect of a new quarantine. He saidL: If the news is confirmed it would have a huge impact on the number of tourists. Interesting article from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health on the global push to develop a vaccine for coronavirus, which contains warnings from lead scientists that we are unlikely to get a vaccine until the end of 2021. Here’s an excerpt: As reopening measures begin across the US and the world, it becomes increasingly clear that the road to normal – a time without social distancing, masks, and quarantines – will be a long one. Barring the discovery of an effective treatment, only a readily available and easily administered vaccine will allow a return to former ways of life. The good news is that more than 125 vaccines are currently in development, according to the WHO. But most of these vaccines won’t make it to clinical trials, and many of those that do won’t be effective or safe enough to achieve licensure, says Peter Hotez, MD, PhD, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. He adds that predictions that a vaccine could be ready by the fall are unrealistic. “We won’t see our first Covid-19 vaccines until late 2021 at the earliest,” he says. To make a vaccine, scientists must first understand the structure of the virus, how rapidly the virus mutates, and whether those mutations affect the immune response, says the Center for Immunization Research’s Kawsar Talaat, MD, an assistant professor in International Health. A potential vaccine must then undergo rigorous testing. The quickest a vaccine has been developed to combat a novel pathogen is four years. And there are still no effective vaccines for some pathogens, such as HIV. AstraZeneca has expanded an agreement with Oxford Biomedica to scale up production of its potential Covid-19 vaccine, as the race continues to find an effective method of combatting the deadly virus. Under the supply agreement, the Oxford-based cell and gene therapy firm said it would produce tens of millions of doses of AstraZeneca’s potential vaccine, AZD1222, for 18 months, which could be extended by a further 18 months into 2023. It will be made at the firm’s three manufacturing suites at its new centre, Oxbox, in Oxford. Two of the suites will be ready to use in the next two months, earlier than expected. AstraZeneca will pay Oxford Biomedica £50m under the deal. Tony Abbott, the former Australian prime minister tipped to become a UK trade envoy, has railed against Covid “health dictatorships”, saying politicians need to balance allowing more elderly Covid patients to die by nature taking its course, with the economic costs of an extreme lockdown. He said it was costing the Australian government as much as $200,000 (£110,000) to give an elderly person an extra year’s life, substantially beyond what governments would usually pay for life-saving drugs. He said not enough politicians were “behaving like health economists trained to pose uncomfortable questions about the level of deaths we might have to live with”. Hello everyone. I am running the Guardian’s live feed today, bringing you the latest major headlines and news on coronavirus from across the globe. Please do share any questions, thoughts, comments or tips with me while I work. If you have a news story from where you are based then you can get in touch via any of the channels below. Thanks so much.

Data has shown that only 17% of workers in British cities had returned to their workplaces by early August, and one of the country’s business leaders said last week that big urban centres looked like ghost towns. “The next stage we’ll look at is specifically the guidance on how to get back to work safely and we expect to see that later this week,” the prime minister’s spokesman said, commenting on the government’s ongoing public information campaign. Johnson’s message is that returning to work will help stimulate the economy, he added. In Indonesia, officials in hazmat suits have paraded empty coffins through the streets of Jakarta to remind residents that coronavirus cases are still rising rapidly in one of Asia’s worst-hit nations. A convoy of truck hearses and pallbearers snaked its way through crowded neighbourhoods, with some participants also donning headpieces depicting ghost-like figures known as pocong. “We’re hoping this coffin parade will remind people to be more aware of the risk of disobeying health safety rules,” said Mundari, the head of south Jakarta’s Cilandak district, who like many Indonesians goes by one name. “They can picture how things would be if they died of Covid-19,” he added. The mock coffins got the attention of Cilandak resident Ahmad Soleh Suzany. “It’s very scary because this shows the huge dangers we’re facing,” he told AFP. The move comes as Indonesia’s coronavirus toll mounts, with the more than 100 frontline doctors dead and possibly hundreds of children. The world’s fourth most populous nation has reported over 177,000 confirmed cases and 7,505 deaths, but with some of the world’s lowest testing rates the true scale is widely believed to be much greater. The pandemic has shown how the Earth can recover if we allow it to rest and must spur people to adopt simpler lifestyles to help a planet groaning under the constant demand for economic growth, Pope Francis has said. In his latest urgent appeal to help a fragile environment, Francis also renewed his call for the cancellation of the debts of the most vulnerable countries. Such action would be just, he said, since rich countries have exploited poorer nations’ natural resources. In some ways, the current pandemic has led us to rediscover simpler and sustainable lifestyles, Francis said in a written message. Already we can see how the Earth can recover if we allow it to rest: the air becomes cleaner, the waters clearer, and animals have returned to many places from where they had previously disappeared, he wrote. The pandemic has brought us to a crossroads. The pontiff urged people to seize the opportunity to reflect on their habits of energy usage, consumption, transportation and diet. Until now, constant demand for growth and an endless cycle of production and consumption are exhausting the natural world, the pope said, adding: “Creation is groaning” The approval ratings of Mexican president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, have risen during the coronavirus pandemic, with a majority of surveyed voters applauding his campaign to crack down on political corruption, an opinion poll has shown. López Obrador now holds a 65% approval rate, according to a nationwide survey of 1,000 voters in face-to-face interviews conducted by pollster Parametria from 26-30 August. The rate rose from 54% in March, just as the coronavirus crisis took hold in Latin America’s second-largest economy. López Obrador will give a state of the nation address on Tuesday, as Mexico stands in fourth-place globally for most lives lost to the pandemic. Parametria’s August poll was its first in-person survey since February, and comes a day after a door-to-door poll from newspaper Reforma showed the president’s approval fell to 56% in August from 59% in March. When asked about the Reforma results at his daily news conference on Monday, Lopez Obrador said he suspected the newspaper had selectively chosen to interview his opponents. His own poll showed his popularity as high as 70%, he said. According to Parametria, 46% of respondents said Mexico is “on the right path,” compared to 43% in a January-February poll. In a ranking of López Obrador’s performance in more than a dozen areas, including education, poverty and jobs, he scored highest in the effort to root out corruption, with 67% of respondents classifying him as “good” or “very good.” The fight against drug trafficking ranked the lowest, with just 43% of respondents giving him a positive score. In all the areas he scored notably higher than his two predecessors. Malaysia has said it would bar entry of long-term immigration pass holders from India, Indonesia and the Philippines from 7 September, in a bid to curtail imported coronavirus cases amid a spate of new clusters in the country. Health authorities in south-east Asia’s third-largest economy have recorded over 9,300 cases and 128 deaths, with new cases found in clusters detected in at least four states. The entry ban on pass holders from the three countries will include permanent residents, expatriates, students and those on spouse visas and participants of Malaysia’s My Second Home programme, senior minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said. “The decision was made on the advice of the health ministry to clamp down on the spread of imported Covid-19 cases,” Ismail Sabri said in a televised news conference. India is the third most affected country by the pandemic behind the United States and Brazil, with its coronavirus tally reaching nearly 3.7 million on Tuesday. A total of 7,505 people have died of the coronavirus in Indonesia, the highest in the region, while the Philippines, which has reported over 224,000 cases, has seen a continuous rise in infections. Hungary has decided to exempt tourists visiting from three neighbouring states from a lockdown of its borders that took effect on Tuesday, provided they test negative for Covid-19 beforehand, prompting a rebuke from the European Commission. The EU executive said Hungary’s move to admit visitors from the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia but not from other EU member states amounted to discrimination and was illegal. Hungary said last week it would close its borders to foreigners from Tuesday to curb a rise in coronavirus cases. Returning Hungarian citizens can leave a 14-day quarantine only if they provide two negative Covid tests. However, after talks with Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis on Monday, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban agreed to let Czech visitors who have already booked holidays in Hungary for September enter the country, the Foreign Ministry said. The easing was subsequently extended to Poland and Slovakia, the ministry said in a statement. Visitors coming to Hungary have to produce a negative Covid test not older than five days, which Budapest says represents sufficient safety guarantees. The EU Commission in Brussels said Hungary’s decision clashed with the bloc’s rules on free travel. “Any measures that do not comply with those fundamental principles of EU law should of course be immediately retracted,” European Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said, adding he would raise the matter with Budapest. Orban’s nationalist government, in power since 2010, has often been at odds with Brussels over what the EU and his critics in Hungary say is an erosion of the rule of law and the independence of the media and judiciary. As of Tuesday, Hungary had reported 6,257 coronavirus cases with 616 deaths. The number of new cases has surged in recent days, just as Hungary prepares to start a new school year. Its economy shrank by 13.6% year-on-year in the April-June period this year due to the pandemic and the lockdown it prompted. Authorities eased the lockdown measures in May. Millions of students headed back to class in France, Belgium and England on Tuesday as European schools cautiously reopened amid rising coronavirus cases in several countries, with face masks often mandatory. Officials have drawn fire from parents and teachers worried that strict social distancing and other protective measures will not be enough to prevent a second wave of Covid-19. But many governments insist that the greater risk is young people losing out on crucial in-person lessons, and that keeping kids at home for distance learning puts too big a burden on working parents. “I do not underestimate how challenging the last few months have been, but I do know how important it is for children to be back in school, not only for their education but for their development and well-being,” Britain’s Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said. The UN’s education agency UNESCO warned that just half the roughly 900 million primary and secondary students restarting school from August to October will actually be allowed back in classrooms. “Several generations are facing the threat of school closures, which concern hundreds of millions of students and have lasted many months,” the agency’s director general Audrey Azoulay said in a statement late Monday. In France, some 12.4 million students returned Tuesday, with masks required for all teachers as well as students over 11. “It doesn’t bother me to wear a mask, even if it does feel a little weird,” said Marie, who was starting her first year of middle school in the southern French city of Marseille. But many teachers were less enthusiastic. “How can we connect with children when half your face is hidden behind a mask?” said Julie Siata, who teaches English at another Marseille school. Hello everyone. I am running the Guardian’s live feed bringing you all the updates around Covid-19 globally. Please do get in touch if you want to share any comments or news tips with me. Hope everybody is doing ok. Thanks for following. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Below are some of the top headlines today: India leads global rise in new weekly cases India reported the most new Covid-19 cases of any country in the past week, its nearly half a million fresh infections pushing the global tally up by 1%, the World Health Organization (WHO) said. Overall, global new deaths in the past seven days fell by 3% compared with the previous week, the WHO reported, adding that new infections around the world rose by 1.8 million. The respiratory disease is also spreading in the Americas, which continues to account for more than half of reported cases and deaths worldwide, although there have been slight decreases in some areas, WHO said in its latest update. Text books and face masks Tens of millions of pupils returned to school across Europe, their rucksacks loaded with exercise books, geometry sets and, for many, face masks to protect them from the resurgent coronavirus pandemic. Hand cleansing stations, social distancing and staggered play time will become the new normal as countries seek ways to get children back into the classroom safely and their economies functioning once again. But they do so at a time when infections rates are spiralling upwards across the continent and there are widespread concerns that the return to schools and offices, the autumn flu season and excess mortality in winter could drive a second wave. Hong Kong begins China-led mass testing Hong Kong began free coronavirus testing for all residents in the Asian financial hub, as the mainland Chinese-led initiative faced scepticism from the city’s medical community and public, with some activists urging a boycott. The initiative began with a 60-strong mainland team conducting tests. It is the first direct help from China’s health officials for the semi-autonomous city as it battles the pandemic. The scheme has emerged as a politically charged issue, with authorities in Hong Kong and China saying critics are trying to smear the central government. AstraZeneca bolsters vaccine supply AstraZeneca has expanded its agreement with cell therapy firm Oxford Biomedica to mass-produce its Covid-19 potential vaccine, as it looks to scale-up supply ahead of a possible US fast-track approval. AZD1222 is among the leading candidates in the global race for a successful vaccine and it has entered late-stage trials in the United States, the British drugmaker said, as it targets 3 billion doses of the vaccine, globally. Medical waste spills into Indonesian river For residents along Indonesia’s Cisadane River, the coronavirus has brought not just deadly disease, but also a deluge of medical waste: a constant stream of syringes, masks and hazmat suits floating by. As the virus has spread, medical waste had been piling up at Tangerang’s Cipeucang landfill. Then in May its walls collapsed, sending tons of garbage straight into the Cisadane’s khaki green waters. Indonesia’s health ministry acknowledged the problem - saying 1,480 tons of Covid-19 medical waste was produced across the country from March through June - and admitted it lacked treatment facilities, but was working on solutions. Germany expects the economic devastation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic to be less severe than originally feared this year, but it sees a weaker rebound for Europe’s largest economy next year due to sluggish foreign demand. Presenting the government’s updated forecasts on Tuesday, economy minister Peter Altmaier said the economy was doing better than expected and was recovering quickly from the coronavirus shock thanks to a strong response from the state. “Overall, we can say that at least for now, we are dealing with a V-shaped development,” Altmaier told reporters, adding that he did not expect authorities to impose another round of lockdown measures as in March and April. Confirming an earlier Reuters report, Altmaier said Berlin had revised upwards its 2020 forecast to a decline of 5.8% from a previous estimate of 6.3%. Still, this would represent the biggest economic slump since the end of World War Two. During the global financial crisis, the economy contracted by 5.7% in 2009. For 2021, the government revised downward its growth forecast to an expansion of 4.4% from its previous estimate of 5.2%. This means the economy will not reach its pre-pandemic size before early 2022, Altmaier said. The government expects exports to tumble by 12.2% this year before jumping by 8.8% in 2021. Private consumption is seen falling by 6.9% this year and then rising by 4.7% in 2021. Russia’s coronavirus case tally passed the 1 million mark on Tuesday as schools and educational institutions reopened across the world’s largest country with new mandatory safety precautions in place. Russia has the fourth highest case tally in the world after the US, Brazil and India, according to Johns Hopkins University, which has been tracking the virus since it was discovered. But officials say more than 800,000 people have recovered from the disease, and that with just over 17,000 deaths, the death toll is lower than in many other European countries. The coronavirus crisis centre said on Tuesday that the overall case tally stood at 1,000,048 after 4,729 new infections were reported. It said 123 new deaths had been confirmed in the last 24 hours, taking the official death toll to 17,299. President Vladimir Putin, in a nationwide TV address, told school children and students to observe virus safety rules. It is mandatory for teachers to wear masks in schools in Moscow, which has been harder hit by the virus than other parts of Russia. Teachers are allowed to take off their masks in classrooms when teaching however, provided they keep a safe distance from children. Moscow schoolchildren are not required to wear masks in schools. But traditional ceremonies at the start of the school year were cancelled on Tuesday and the use of different classrooms will be limited to reduce infection risks. “I’m not afraid of Covid of course, but I follow restrictions,” Daniil Ivanenko, a 9th-grade student, told Reuters TV at his school in western Moscow on Tuesday. Russia said that 167,044 people are infected with the virus. Hello everyone. I am taking on the Guardian’s live feed bringing you all the updates around Covid-19 globally. Please do get in touch if you want to share any comments or news tips with me. Thanks in advance. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Poland is banning direct flights from 44 countries including Spain, Israel and Romania in order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in the central European country, the government said on Tuesday. The US, Malta, Montenegro, Mexico, Brasil, Argentina and India are also on the list of countries, but local media reported that Russia and China had been removed from it. The ban comes in tomorrow (Wednesday) and follows measures to reintroduce restrictions on public life in the worst affected parts of the country, as the government tries to tackle the spread of the virus without resorting to a complete lockdown. Poles are, however, allowed to fly to and from any country they want if they choose indirect flights through countries that are not on the list, such as Germany. Poland, a country of 38 million, has officially registered 67,922 Covid-19 infections and more than 2,000 people have died from the virus. On Tuesday, 550 new infections were registered, according to health ministry data. Israeli children went back to school on Tuesday despite a high coronavirus infection rate, the threat of a teachers’ strike and a last-minute decision to keep pupils from more than 20 towns at home. Sitting at a tiny table with first graders wearing face masks, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, did not wear a face covering as he grinned despite the tumultuous start to the academic year. Hours earlier, the government announced schools and nurseries in 23 towns would not reopen due to their high coronavirus infection rates. The postponements are a coup for Israel’s coronavirus tsar, Ronni Gamzu, who last month warned Israel could “tear apart all that we have achieved” if schools are reopened too hastily. After Israel’s initial coronavirus lockdown, pupils returned to the classroom in May and dozens of schools were subsequently shut as positive cases sprung up. The guidelines for September remain strict, with an emphasis on small classes and more distance learning for older children, but the coronavirus figures are now far worse than May. The latest figures show more than 2,100 positive test results registered over 24 hours, with 19 deaths on Tuesday, out of a population of 9 million. While teachers went back to the classroom, they are threatening to strike within days. They are pushing for their colleagues to be allowed to stay at home on full pay if they are in a high risk category for contracting coronavirus. AstraZeneca has expanded an agreement with Oxford Biomedica to scale up production of its potential Covid-19 vaccine, my colleague Julia Kollewe reports. Under the supply agreement, the Oxford-based cell and gene therapy firm said it would produce tens of millions of doses of AstraZeneca’s potential vaccine, AZD1222, for 18 months, which could be extended by a further 18 months into 2023. Read the full story here: The number of foreign tourists visiting Spain fell 75% in July from a year earlier, data showed on Tuesday, as the coronavirus outbreak shaved tens of billions of euros off the nation’s usual income from the sector. Spain, usually the world’s second-most visited country after France with 80 million visitors a year, welcomed just 2.5 million foreigners in the normally brisk holiday month of July, Spain’s National Statistics Institute said. Foreign holidaymakers spent €14.29 bn (£12.74bn) in Spain in the year to July, a gaping 73% below the €52.36bn (£46.7bn) they had spent by that point last year. Plunging custom for hotels, bars and other services enjoyed by tourists has contributed to ravaging an economy of which it usually makes up about 12%, as virus cases climbed past 460,000. The government said on Monday it expects a more than 10% rebound in the third quarter of the year after an 18.5% contraction in the second quarter. Britons remained the biggest group visiting Spain during the first seven months, despite a 77% year-on-year decrease in their numbers. In July, when London imposed a quarantine on people returning from Spain, France was the biggest market. The number of new coronavirus cases in Ukraine will continue to rise in September and could reach 3,000 a day by the end of this month, prime minister Denys Shmygal said on Tuesday. Ukraine reported 2,088 cases on Tuesday and 2,141 on Monday. Last week, the daily number of confirmed coronavirus cases jumped to a record 2,481. The increase comes after Ukraine last week imposed a temporary ban on most foreigners from entering the country until 28 September and extended lockdown measures until the end of October to contain a recent spike in cases. The country has reported a total of 123,303 infections and 2,605 deaths from the virus. The total number of coronavirus cases in Russia passed 1 million on Tuesday after 4,729 new infections were reported. That brought the country’s total tally to 1,000,048. Russia’s coronavirus crisis centre said 123 new deaths had been confirmed in the last 24 hours. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 1,218 to 243,599, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Tuesday. The death toll rose by four to 9,302. Good morning from Greater Manchester in England’s north. I’m Helen Pidd and I will be looking after this blog for a few hours today. Here is what has happened over the past eight hours on our Covid-riddled planet: The number of infections in the US surpassed 6 million. India has added nearly 2m coronavirus cases in one month, jumping from 1.64m infections at the end of July to 3.62m at the end of August. Spain has registered more than 23,000 new Covid-19 cases since Friday. France’s new Covid-19 infections surged by almost 50% in August, hitting 281,025 cases, versus 187,919 at the end of July. Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who has consistently downplayed the severity of the coronavirus outbreak, said nobody will be forced to have the vaccine against Covid-19 once it is developed. Hungary has decided to let tourists from its three eastern European neighbours, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, enter the country with a fresh negative coronavirus test, it said late on Monday, just as a lockdown on its borders took effect. Last week, Hungary said it would close its borders to foreigners from Tuesday to curb a rise in coronavirus cases. Returning Hungarian citizens can avoid a 14-day quarantine only if they provide two negative Covid tests. However, after talks with the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, on Monday, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, agreed to let Czech visitors who have already booked holidays in Hungary for September enter the country, the foreign ministry said. The easing was subsequently extended to Poland and Slovakia, the ministry said in a statement. Visitors coming to Hungary have to produce a negative Covid test not older than five days, which Budapest says represents sufficient safety guarantees. As of Monday, Hungary had reported 6,139 coronavirus cases with 615 deaths. The number of new cases has surged in recent days, just as Hungary prepared to start the school year. The Hungarian economy plunged by an annual 13.6% in the second quarter. The country eased lockdown measures in May. World Health Organization director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has taken issue with the opinion that high death rates from Covid-19 are not a major concern if it is mainly the elderly dying with the disease. Accepting someone to die because of age is moral bankruptcy at its highest, and we shouldn’t allow our society to behave this way. The WHO chief urged governments around the world to engage with people demonstrating against Covid-19 curbs and listen to their concerns, but stressed protesters needed to understand the virus was dangerous. Tedros said it was important to “listen to what people are asking, what people are saying … we should engage in an honest dialogue”. But he stressed demonstrators have a responsibility to ensure protests are safe. “The virus is real. It is dangerous. It moves fast and it kills. We have to do everything to protect ourselves and to protect others.” Hong Kong began a mass coronavirus testing programme Tuesday overshadowed by fears that China is using the scheme to harvest DNA, while the number of infections in the US surpassed 6m. The voluntary initiative is offering free tests to millions of Hong Kongers as authorities worldwide continue efforts to stamp out an illness that has killed almost 850,000 and infected more than 25 million. But it comes as populations are increasingly wary of coronavirus curbs and distrust grows in governments’ handling of the pandemic, with protesters taking to the streets in a number of major cities in recent days. German demonstrators against mask rules and other restrictions tried to storm parliament in the biggest of several European protests over the weekend. Suspicions about government intentions have done much to undermine the testing programme in Hong Kong, where disillusionment with officials has been fuelled by China’s crushing of the city’s democracy movement. The scheme is part of an attempt to stamp out a third wave of infections in the densely populated finance hub that began in late June and saw the city reimpose economically painful social distancing measures. But the programme has been hampered by a limited response due to the involvement of mainland Chinese testing firms and doctors - and swirling public fears of the harvesting of data and DNA. Since registration began on Saturday, 510,000 people have signed up to take the free tests. Health experts advising the government however have said as many as 5 million people might need to be tested for the scheme to end the current wave. I reported earlier that India had added nearly 2m cases to its coronavirus case load in August … we now have today’s figures and the country has added a further 69,921 new infections on Tuesday, the lowest daily jump in six days, taking its overall total to 3.69m infections. This is based on more than 1m tests. The country has had the single highest daily total of new cases for more than three weeks, according to a Reuters tally. The death toll rose by 819 on Tuesday to 65,288. How Covid-19 is impacting people’s dreams is the subject of a study being run by a cross-disciplinary team of academics from Australia, the UK and Finland. “Pandemic dreams” are already the subject of a book of essays from Harvard research Deirdre Barrett, alongside reams of popular audience articles and social media posts. “Certainly there were different lines of evidence that inspired this project,” says Dr Jennifer Windt, a senior research fellow in philosophy at Monash University, who will be working on the project alongside researchers from the University of Cambridge in England and Finland’s University of Turku. “People seem to be reporting weird dreams, but also generally they seem to be reporting that they’re dreaming more … and unfortunately often having more negatively toned dreams and nightmares. So that was part of it.” Participants in the “Covid on Mind” study, which will be anonymous, will keep a dream log and undertake a “daily mind-wandering task” over a period of two weeks. But first, they will be asked to complete a wellbeing questionnaire that examines their mental state, and “concerns related to coronavirus specifically” to give the researchers “some measure of how people are doing, how concerned they are about the virus, and changes related to the virus in their everyday lives”. The cross-disciplinary project involves cognitive neuroscientists, psychologists and sleep and dream researchers, many of whom study how dreams reflect people’s mental states while awake. “We have people on the team who’ve done a lot of work on emotion and dreams … the pandemic seems to be an ideal opportunity to study that,” says Widnt. She says there is already a body of research that suggests “negatively toned” dreams are associated with issues like anxiety and depression, and wonders, “Could changes in dreams be a marker to help identify people with mental health issues?” “We’re not interested in interpreting the dreams in any sense,” she explains. “This is really a quite different approach that tries to get objective numbers … It’s really about quantifying changes in emotion, and relating them to measures of waking thought and emotion.” Other researchers will be investigating the number of social interactions people report, both in their dreams and mind-wandering tasks. “Dreaming has been proposed to have a possibly evolutionary function in fine-tuning social skills,” she says. “We know that many of our interactions have gone virtual … does that have an impact on how people dream?” “Dream bizarreness”, which Windt describes as “a technical word for all of the different ways in which dreams can be weird”, will also be a focus for Melbourne-based PhD student Manuela Kirberg. In order to quantify how bizarre, social, positive or negative a dream is, independent raters read through dream reports and score them using established criteria. They rate the occurrence of “emotion terms” and “social content”. Any comments that do not form part of a dream’s description – for instance the dreamer’s own interpretation – are discarded, and raters talk to each other to ensure there is “sufficient agreement” in how they are scoring the dreams. “You need a lot of patience and sticktoitiveness to do that scoring, as well as training,” Windt says. “A lot of dreams are pretty mundane.” The researchers are currently recruiting volunteers for the study – and anyone over the age of 18 who lives in the UK, Australia or Finland can participate. The study will be open for up to 12 months. The resulting dataset will feature well over 1,000 dreams and daydreams. Windt is particularly curious about the dreams and mind-wandering of people in lockdown. “It’s obviously horrible what’s happening in Melbourne,” she says. But, “I do think it is a particularly interesting period to get people involved … How do their dreams relate to the changing outer circumstance?” Windt’s own work as a philosopher focuses on “consciousness and cognitive science” – and she is particularly interested in the mind-wandering elements of the study. “There’s a large body of research that shows we spend 30 to 50% of waking life mind-wandering,” she says. “It really suggests that for much of waking life we aren’t in control of our thoughts and attention at all … That’s really interesting as a philosopher.” Tens of thousands of girls across Asia are being forced into marriage by desperate families plunged into poverty because of the coronavirus pandemic, as campaigners warn years of progress tackling the practice is being undone. Child marriage has long been common in traditional communities from the Indonesian archipelago to India, Pakistan and Vietnam, but numbers had been decreasing as charities made inroads by encouraging access to education and women’s health services. These improvements are being eroded as the impact of the virus causes mass job losses leaving parents struggling to feed their families, experts say. “All of the gains we’ve made in the past decade are really going to suffer,” said Shipra Jha, from ngo Girls Not Brides. “Child marriage is firmly rooted in gender inequality and patriarchal structures. What’s happened is that it’s become compounded in the Covid era,” she said. Poverty, lack of education, and insecurity, drive child marriage even in stable times, so periods of crises exacerbate the problem, the charity says. Worldwide, an estimated 12 million girls are wed every year before the age of 18, according to the UN. But the organisation has now warned that unless urgent action is taken to tackle the economic and social impact of the virus - an additional 13 million child marriages will take place in the next decade. In Asia, charities report the snowball of forced unions has already begun, estimating tens of thousands are already affected - though hard data is yet to be collated. “There has been an increase in child marriages during this lockdown period. There is rampant unemployment, job loss. Families are barely able to make ends meet, so they think it’s best to get their young daughters married off,” said Rolee Singh who runs India’s ‘1 Step 2 Stop Child Marriage’ campaign. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who has consistently downplayed the severity of the coronavirus outbreak, said on Monday that nobody will be forced to have the vaccine against Covid-19 once it is developed. The comments come after the government earmarked millions of dollars for the purchase and future production of vaccinations as Brazil suffers the second worst outbreak of the pandemic outside the United States. “No one can force anyone to get a vaccine,” he said in response to a question from a supporter, a video posted on social media showed. Brazil has become a hot spot in recent months, with 3,908,272 confirmed cases and 121,381 deaths from Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. On Monday, the Health Ministry reported 45,961 new cases of the coronavirus and 553 deaths from Covid-19 in the past 24 hours. Bolsonaro, who recently recovered from the coronavirus, has downplayed its severity, calling it a “small flu”, ignoring scientific recommendations and opposing quarantine efforts by Brazilian governors and mayors. Despite this, his government earmarked 1.9 billion reais (US$346 million) in early August in funding to buy 100 million doses of the vaccine candidate being developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca PLC and to eventually produce it in Brazil. The Sao Paulo state government is also working on a potential vaccine with China’s Sinovac Biotech. Brazil hopes distribution of doses of either vaccine can begin at the start of next year. Bolsonaro’s acting health minister Eduardo Pazuello, an Army general, has appointed a veterinarian to lead Brazil’s vaccination program. Lauricio Monteiro Cruz, who was working at the ministry on the control of the parasitic disease leishmaniasis, is a specialist in the prevention of diseases in animals, according to his CV on the ministry website. Bolsonaro’s response to the virus outbreak has led to significant street demonstrations, and a billboard campaign accusing him of mishandling the pandemic, at the cost of people’s lives. French pupils go back to school Tuesday as schools across Europe open their doors to greet returning pupils this month, nearly six months after the coronavirus outbreak forced them to close and despite rising infection rates across the continent. Many teachers and parents are worried the reopening of schools will accelerate the spread of Covid-19, but governments have insisted it should go ahead. French children return to school on Tuesday, after a two-month long summer break that followed two weeks of obligatory schooling just before the holidays. Teachers and pupils between 11 and 18 will be required to wear masks both indoors and outdoors. Pupils in Belgium will also return to school on Tuesday, while those in Germany went back last month. Masks will also be compulsory in Greece, where children are expected to return to school next Monday with a maximum of 25 children per class. In England and Wales - where children return to school this week after a six-month closure - the government initially said masks in schools would not be necessary, but reversed its policy last Wednesday. The new guidance advises secondary school students aged 11 to 18 and staff to wear face coverings in corridors and communal areas, in places with local virus restrictions. The Spanish government has insisted all children over the age of six must wear masks at all times and wash their hands at least five times a day. Children should maintain a distance of 1.5 metres from each other, and regional governments have hired additional teachers to reduce class sizes. South Korea’s coronavirus cases have remained under 300 for a third day in a row. On Tuesday the CDC recorded 235 cases, including 222 local infections. It took the total number of cases recorded in the country over the 20,000 mark, to 20,182, since the first infection was reported on 20 January. “It is worrisome that more than 30 percent of the confirmed COVID-19 patients over the past two weeks are those aged more than 60,” vice health minister, Kim Ganglip, said in a briefing. “The risk of dying due to the COVID-19 virus is highest among older people and those with underlying diseases.” Of the new cases, 175 were in the capital area. India has added nearly 2m coronavirus cases in one month, jumping from 1.64m infections at the end of July to 3.62m at the end of August. It’s the highest single-month rise recorded in any country in a month throughout the pandemic. The next highest monthly total is the US, which added 1.91m cases in July. India also saw a surge in deaths in August of 28,859, which, according to figures from Our World in Data, was more than 50% higher than in July. As we reported earlier, India on Monday reported it’s economy shrank by nearly 24% in the April-June quarter. It’s the biggest fall since the government began publishing quarterly statistics in 1996. And we have just heard from the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, who says when he announces his road map out of the Australian state’s six-week lockdown, there will be two roadmaps ... one for regional parts in the state and one for metropolitan Melbourne. Andrews said: And ultimately, this is all about making sure that the sacrifice, the pain, the amazing work that Victorians have done counts for something. It’s no good doing this too fast, opening up too much, too quickly, only to be open for just a few weeks and back in lockdown by Christmas time. We don’t want that. We want to do everything we can to avoid that. In Australia we are getting some more information about cases in the most populous state of New South Wales. The state has 13 new cases, 11 of which are locally acquired and linked to known clusters, including a cluster in the centre of the city, which now totals 41 cases. China has reported 10 new Covid-19 cases, down from 17 reported a day earlier, the country’s health authority said on Tuesday. The National Health Commission said in a statement that all new cases were imported infections involving travellers from overseas, marking the 16th consecutive day of no local infections. The number of new asymptomatic cases rose to 34 from 19 a day earlier. China does not count symptomless coronavirus infections as confirmed cases. The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China now stands at 85,058, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634. There are 14 new cases of COVID-19 to report in New Zealand today - nine in MIQ (managed quarantine) and five in the community, all related to the Auckland cluster. Yesterday Auckland dropped down from Level 3 to Level 2, despite more cases emerging. There are 10 people with COVID-19 in hospital today, two of whom are in ICU care. Forty-four thousand people have now been through managed isolation in New Zealand. With today’s 14 new cases, New Zealand’s total number of active cases is 132. Of those, 33 are imported cases in MIQ facilities, and 99 are community cases. Yesterday the country’s laboratories processed 8,599 tests for COVID-19, bringing the total number of tests completed to date to 766,626. Quarantine minister Megan Woods said: “Covid is growing, not slowing around the world”, and New Zealand is no exception, with cases continuing to arrive at the border. Private security guards are now being “phased out” of isolation facilities, and replaced by defence force personnel. Eventually, the deployment of defence force officers in managed isolation facilities would be larger than New Zealand’s entire deployment to East Timor. We are about to get New Zealand’s daily media briefing on coronavirus cases, today hosted by minister for managed isolation and quarantine Megan Woods and Air Commodore Darryn Webb. Local media is reporting that there are 14 new cases in the country, nine of which are in managed isolation, and five in the community. Our NZ correspondent, Eleanor Ainge Roy, will bring us the updates. Hong Kong has started conducting mass coronavirus tests on Tuesday, a health scheme that has been swept up in the political debate dividing the city, where many remain deeply distrustful of both local leaders and China, Agence France-Presse reports. The voluntary tests are part of an attempt to stamp out a third wave of infections that began in late June and saw the densely populated city reimpose economically painful social distancing measures. The programme has been hampered by a limited response due to the involvement of mainland Chinese testing firms and doctors – and swirling public mistrust of local authorities as Beijing cracks down on the city’s democracy movement. Since registration began on Saturday, 510,000 people have signed up to take the free tests – around 7% of the city’s 7.5 million population. More than half of all 141 community test centres across the city are fully booked for their first day on Tuesday. Hong Kong has recorded just over 4,800 infections since the virus first hit the city in late January but about 75% of those cases were detected since the start of July. Tests will run for between a week and two weeks depending on public demand with numbers limited each day to reduce the risk of infection. Brazil reported 45,961 new cases of the novel coronavirus and 553 deaths from the disease caused by the virus in the past 24 hours, the health ministry said on Monday. Brazil has registered 3,908,272 cases of the virus since the pandemic began, while the official death toll from COVID-19 has risen to 121,381, according to ministry data, in the world’s worst coronavirus outbreak outside the United States. Mexico’s health ministry on Monday reported 3,719 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections and 256 additional fatalities, bringing the total in the country to 599,560 cases and 64,414 deaths. Spain has registered more than 23,000 new COVID-19 cases since Friday, health emergency chief Fernando Simon said on Monday, suggesting the infection rate had declined slightly from an 21 August peak, Reuters reports. Health ministry data showed 2,489 new cases were diagnosed in the past 24 hours, bringing the total since the onset of the pandemic to 462,858. “Of course we are worried because we have to stabilise and bring down the infection chain,” Health Minister Salvador Illa told Catalonia’s regional TV channel 324 late on Monday, adding that the goal is to avoid pressuring hospitals. Illa said that the situation is not comparable to the pandemic’s first peak in March and April, noting hospitals now have greater capacity. He said that nothing can be ruled out but it would be unlikely Spain would need to close schools again or impose a new state of emergency to try to tackle the virus. Since bringing the first wave largely under control through a strict lockdown that ended in June, Spain has been hit by a sharp resurgence of infections as measures were relaxed and mass testing began. On 21 August, daily infections hit nearly 10,000, their highest level since the peak of the epidemic in late March. They have come down to about 9,000 to 8,000 per day last week, updated health ministry data showed. Back to India and the former Indian president, Pranab Mukherjee, a senior leader of the Congress party who served in multiple cabinets during five decades in politics, has died. He was 84. Mukherjee had emergency surgery for a blood clot in his brain on 10 August after a fall. The hospital said he tested positive for Covid-19 after the surgery and his condition was critical. He remained in a coma after the operation. The hospital said his health began declining on Monday after a lung infection resulted in septic shock. The government has announced a week of mourning. Prime minister Narendra Modi, who leads the rival Bharatiya Janata party, tweeted that Mukherjee “left an indelible mark on the development trajectory” of India. “His wise counsel on key policy matters will never be forgotten by me,” he said. You can read our full story below: Australia’s southern state of Victoria has recorded 70 new cases and five new deaths. The state has been in a strict stage four lockdown, which has seen new infections fall and I believe 70 is the lowest case number in nearly two months. The premier, Daniel Andrews, said he the roadmap out of the lockdown would be outlined on the weekend. Victoria has been the centre of cases in the past two months, but concerns are held for a growing cluster linked to Sydney’s central business district, and on Tuesday the north-eastern state of Queensland reported two new cases. The state’s southern border with New South Wales will remain closed through September. You can stay up to date on all of the developments on our Australian live blog. India’s economy growth suffered a historic 23.9% contraction in the April-June quarter, as the strict coronavirus lockdown hit businesses. It was the biggest fall since the country started publishing quarterly statistics 1996. On Monday the government warned the figures could be revised further since the pandemic had also affected the ability to collect accurate data on economic activity. “The entire quarter was spent in lockdown and it was a complete washout for the Indian economy,” Mumbai-based economist Ashutosh Datar told Agence France-Presse. India’s sudden shutdown from late March prompted a huge exodus by millions of migrant workers who fled cities for their villages due to a lack of food and money. Many factories struggled to cope with labour shortages, even after lockdowns lifted. Construction activity was halved, while manufacturing plummeted by nearly 40% compared to the previous year. India has the fastest growing rate of coronavirus infections, with 3.62m infections and 64,469 deaths. It ranks as the third worst affected country on both counts, behind the US and Brazil. France’s new Covid-19 infections surged by almost 50% in August, hitting 281,025 cases, versus 187,919 at the end of July. New cases in August increased on average by a record 3,003 every day, a figure four times higher than July’s average increase of 746 per day. The seven-day moving average of new infections, which smoothes out reporting irregularities, stood at 5,167, reaching a new record for a fourth day in a row, versus a low of 272 on 27 May, two weeks after the country ended its two-month long lockdown. The surge of new cases has led authorities to re-impose some containment measures, such as making face masks mandatory in the streets, shops and public transportation of almost all the country’s main cities. And, as of Tuesday, masks will also be compulsory in workplaces. But, as the new school year starts this week, French president Emmanuel Macron and prime minister Jean Castex have been saying they will do everything to avoid a new national lockdown. The World Health Organization has urged governments to engage with people demonstrating against Covid-19 restrictions and listen to their concerns, but stressed protesters needed to understand the virus was dangerous. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus voiced understanding for the growing frustration felt as people continue to have to deal with restrictions eight months into the pandemic. “We understand that people are tired and yearn to get on with their lives. We understand that countries want to get their societies and economies going again,” he said. The UN health agency, he stressed, “fully supports efforts to re-open economies and societies... but we want to see it done safely.” But he also insisted that “no country can just pretend the pandemic is over”. “If countries are serious about opening up, they must be serious about suppressing transmission and saving lives,” he said, insisting that “opening up without having control is a recipe for disaster”. Tedros took issue with the opinions voiced by some that high death rates were not really a concern if it is mainly the elderly who are dying. “Accepting someone to die because of age is moral bankruptcy at its highest, and we shouldn’t allow our society to behave this way,” he said. “Every life whether it is young or old is precious. And we have to do everything to save it.” Asked about recent demonstrations in a number of countries against coronavirus restrictions, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was important to “listen to what people are asking, what people are saying”. “We should engage in an honest dialogue,” he told reporters, stressing though that demonstrators have a responsibility to ensure protests are safe. “The virus is real. It is dangerous. It moves fast and it kills,” he said, insisting “we have to do everything to protect ourselves and to protect others”. Speaking about the broader protests, the WHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan pointed out that “epidemics and emergencies create strong emotions, and acceptance of measures is always very, very tough. “It is really important that governments don’t overreact to people protesting against measures,” he told the virtual briefing. “The real important thing to do is to enter into a dialogue with groups.” Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s continuing live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, with me, Alison Rourke. The World Health Organization’s boss, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, says “no country can just pretend the pandemic is over”, warning that “opening up without having control is a recipe for disaster”. But Tedros urged states to understand the the growing frustration people felt over the pandemic: “We understand that people are tired and yearn to get on with their lives. We understand that countries want to get their societies and economies going again,” he said. His emergencies director, Michael Ryan, called on governments not to “overreact to people protesting against measures,” saying that “epidemics and emergencies create strong emotions, and acceptance of measures is always very, very tough”. In other developments: France’s new Covid-19 infections shot up by 50% in August. France saw its highest monthly tally since the beginning of the outbreak earlier this year, while hospitalisations for the disease seem to be creeping up again. Spain infections rise more than 23,000 since Friday. Health ministry data showed 2,489 new cases were diagnosed in the past 24 hours, bringing the total since the onset of the pandemic to 462,858. The United States passed 6m coronavirus infections, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The milestone comes amid rising infection in some Midwestern states, including Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota. Hong Kong will start conducting mass coronavirus tests on Tuesday. The voluntary tests are part of an attempt to stamp out a third wave of infections that began in late June and saw the densely populated city reimpose economically painful social distancing measures. India’s former president Pranab Mukherjee died after testing positive. He was 84. Mukherjee had emergency surgery for a blood clot in his brain on 10 August at New Delhi’s army hospital research and referral after suffering a fall. The hospital said he had tested positive for coronavirus after the surgery and his condition was critical. The news came as the country’s economy shrank nearly 24% in the last quarter. The United Arab Emirates recorded more than 500 daily Covid-19 infections, the highest number over a 24-hour period in nearly two months. The Gulf Arab state has reported 541 infections and two deaths, the highest since 683 cases were recorded on 5 July.
15	That’s all for today’s live coverage. But be sure to check back later for the reports off the rest of Tuesday’s action. And in the meantime here’s Kevin Mitchell’s report off Andy Murray’s gripping comeback earlier today. Second set: Ahn 5-7, 3-6 Williams Williams has triple match point after following an unforced error by Ahn with her 12th and 13th aces of the afternoon. She squanders the first of them with a double fault, but makes good on the next one with a 102mph serve that Ahn can’t return into the court. With her 102nd career victory at this tournament, she’s officially surpassed Chris Evert for most US Open wins ever. Second set: Ahn 5-7, 3-5 Williams* (*denotes next server) Ahn showing fight in holding to stay in the match after Williams pushed it to 30-all and looked poised for the finish. Now Serena will serve for a spot in the second round. Second set: *Ahn 5-7, 2-5 Williams (*denotes next server) Serena holds at love to back up the break, capping it with a 112mph ace out wide that Ahn doesn’t even bother to lifting her racket for. Ahn will serve to stay in the tournament after the change of ends. Williams breaks in sixth game of second set! Second set: Ahn 5-7, 2-4 Williams* (*denotes next server) It’s all getting away from Ahn, who loses three quick points on her serve to fall behind love-40. She saves the first with an 82mph ace, but Williams pounces on a second serve on the following point and locks down the break with a clinical backhand winner. The end may be nigh. Second set: *Ahn 5-7, 2-3 Williams (*denotes next server) Williams cruises to a straightforward hold to consolidate the break. A third consecutive game for the six-time US Open champion and she appears to have turned the tables on Ahn, who badly needs a hold to stem the tide following the changeover. Williams breaks in fourth game of second set! Second set: Ahn 5-7, 2-2 Williams* (*denotes next server) Williams rattles off four straight points from 40-15 to break Ahn’s serve. A devastating turn for the American upstart and we’re back on level terms in the second. Second set: *Ahn 5-7, 2-1 Williams (*denotes next server) Williams holds comfortably to get on the board in the second set. Meanwhile, today’s victories by Andy Murray and Dan Evans have made it a banner opening round for old Blighty: Along with Monday winners Cam Norrie and Kyle Edmund, there are four British men in the second round of the US Open for the first time since 1974. Second set: Ahn 5-7, 2-0 Williams* (*denotes next server) Ahn immediately backs up the break with a brisk service game. A promising sign as the unforced errors begin to creep into Williams’s game with greater frequency. She’s up to 17 on the afternoon (against 18 winners). Ahn breaks in first game of second set! Second set: *Ahn 5-7, 1-0 Williams (*denotes next server) Williams looks bound to serve her way out of trouble with an ace and a forehand winner from love-30 down, but Ahn wins two quick points on Serena’s second serve to steal an early break once again. Serena is 22 of 26 (85%) on first-serve points won, but only 4 of 17 (24%) on second-serve points. Williams breaks in 12th game of first set! First set: Ahn 5-7 Williams We’ve seen it countless times down the years but once again Williams manages to ratchet up her level when the pressure is highest. Ahn falls behind love-30, then 15-40, giving Williams a pair of break-point chances. But she needs only one, returning a meek 76mph second serve with such power to Ahn’s backhand side that she can’t do more than dump it into the net. First set: *Ahn 5-6 Williams (*denotes next server) Williams serves her way out of a 15-30 hole, the fifth time in six service games she’s found herself behind. Ahn will serve to stay in the first set once more. First set: Ahn 5-5 Williams* (*denotes next server) Ahn holds for 5-all. Says Chris Evert of Serena from the commentary booth: “She’s not as invincible to the players as she once was. The players are not as intimidated. ... It would be 2-love for Serena right away when they walk out with her. They’ve seen her lose a few matches and become more human.” As an aside: Wednesday’s order of play has just been released. The second-rounder between Novak Djokovic and Britain’s Kyle Edmund is second on Ashe with Naomi Osaka and Stefanos Tsitsipas slated for the night session. First set: *Ahn 4-5 Williams (*denotes next server) Williams opens the eighth game with an unreturnable serve, but Ahn makes things uncomfortable with consecutive winners for 15-30. After trading unforced errors, Ahn has another break-point chance, but Williams erases it with a 104mph service winner down the pipe. She then follows with a 103mph ace out wide and another service winner to nail down the hold, improving to 84% on first-serve points (16 of 19 overall). First set: Ahn 4-4 Williams* (*denotes next server) Ahn caps a comfortable hold with a forehand passing shot winner. Nicely done. First set: *Ahn 3-4 Williams (*denotes next server) Williams holds at love, opening the game with another ace out wide and capping it with a crisp backhand volley winner.

First set: Ahn 3-3 Williams* (*denotes next server) Ahn betrays her nerves with a double fault after the changeover, but steadies herself nicely with three straight winners for 40-15.

From there, however, Ahn cleans up nicely, winning two quick points to hold. First set: *Ahn 2-3 Williams (*denotes next server) An ominous game for Serena: 110mph ace out wide, 100mph ace out wide, 122mph ace down the middle, 105mph ace down the middle. A stress-free hold and Ahn will try to keep in step after the change of ends. Williams breaks in fourth game of first set! First set: Ahn 2-2 Williams* (*denotes next server) Ahn quickly falls behind 15-40, giving Williams a pair of break-point chances. She saves the first but sprays a forehand wide on the second, allowing Williams to get back on level terms.

But the former world No 1 decides no more gifts, rattling off four quick points capped by a forehand volley winner to seal the hold. First set: Ahn 2-0 Williams* (*denotes next server) Ahn consolidates the break comfortably. Five unforced errors already for Williams in the first two games. Ahn breaks in first game of first set! First set: *Ahn 1-0 Williams (*denotes next server) Kristie Ahn, who served up one of the feelgood yarns of last year’s US Open with her fourth-round run, is off to a promising start against the 23-time major champion. Williams crushes a pair of aces to get it to 40-30, but follows with an unforced error at the net then back-to-back double faults. Tumaini Carayol also has serious news away from the court: The former world No 6 Carla Suárez Navarro announced on social media she has been diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma and will undergo six months of chemotherapy. The Spaniard, known as one of the most popular players on the tour, had been planning to finish her career this year before the virus. “When we spoke a few days ago when she gave me the news, I was, I think, shocked, because I was expecting to see her in this tournament. You know, she’s such a nice woman, so sweet, so kind, so humble,” said Garbiñe Muguruza, a friend and frequent doubles partner of Suarez Navarro after her 6-4 6-4 win against Nao Hibino. “I, for sure, will dedicate this win to her, because I want her to feel that we are behind her, that I am behind her, and I will go and see her at some point when it is fine.” Murray’s fellow Britons, Johanna Konta and Heather Watson, were in action earlier today with Konta coming out as winner. Tumaini Carayol has further details: Loyal reader Simon McMahon checks in via email: Evening Bryan. It shouldn’t really come as a surprise that Andy continues to take us on an emotional rollercoaster ride every time he plays, but still. When you look up the word ‘drama’ in the dictionary, it should say ‘see Andy Murray’. Well put. Murray breaks in 10th game of fifth set! Fifth set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 6-4 Nishioka Murray pounds a pair of winners to push it to 30-all on Nishioka’s serve and he’s two points from victory.

Fifth set: *Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 1-1 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka holds comfortably in his opening service game of the decider. A note for the history buffs: three of Murray’s nine career wins from two sets down have come at the US Open. Interestingly enough (or not), two of those three came against left-handers like Nishioka. 2008 R3: def Melzer, 6-7, 4-6, 7-6, 6-1, 6-3 2011 R2: def Haase, 6-7, 2-6, 6-2, 6-0, 6-4 2015 R2: def Mannarino, 5-7, 4-6, 6-1, 6-3, 6-1 Fifth set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 1-0 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Another patchy service game from Murray to open the decider, but he manages to wriggle out of danger.

Fourth-set tiebreak: *Murray 4-1 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka overcooks a backhand on his serve to start, gifting Murray an early minibreak. But the world No 49 moves back level when Murray mishits a drop shot while serving at 1-all.

Fourth set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 6-6 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray wins the first two points and we appear bound for a tiebreaker, but the indefatigable Nishioka pushes it to 30-all, then to deuce. Then Murray misfires on a volley under duress and suddenly he’s match point down – but he saves it with a 127mph thunderbolt out wide that Nishioka can’t return into the court. Deuce.

Murray will serve to stay in the tournament after the changeover. Fourth set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 4-4 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray appears to have righted the ship with his serve, at least for now. He goes unreturnable, ace, ace, unreturnable to hold at love and has gotten eight straight first offerings in going back to his previous service game. Fourth set: *Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 3-4 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka slots his sixth and seventh aces of the day en route to another elementary hold of serve. Still on level terms here in the fourth. Fourth set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 3-3 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) A handful of loose points sees Murray fall behind love-30, then 15-40 after yet another double fault. But he quickly saves both break points, then holds with a pair of winners from the baseline. Danger averted. Fourth set: *Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 2-3 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka reels off a second straight love hold, and third overall, with three crisp winners followed by a 112mph ace right down Broadway. Fourth set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 2-2 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) And Murray responds with his cleanest service game of the day: forehand volley winner, service winner, 106mph ace out wide, backhand winner at the net. Fourth set: *Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 1-2 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka breezes through a love hold in about a minute’s time. Fourth set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 1-1 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Holds of serve haven’t come easy for Murray today and this one is no different after his 10th double fault of the day pushes it to deuce. His 11th double gives Nishioka a break point, which Murray saves. Then his 12th double fives Nishioka another break point, which Murray again saves. From there Murray escapes with the hold after no small labor exerted. Fourth set: *Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 0-1 Nishioka (*denotes next server) A promising start for Nishioka, who is pushed to deuce but wins two quick ones from there, holding to open the fourth. Third-set tiebreak: Murray 5-7 Nishioka Both players continue to hold their serve until Nishioka, serving at 4-5, can only watch as Murray ends a 14-shot rally with a blistering forehand winner. Moments later, Murray nails down the set after an unforced error by Nishioka, punctuating it with a lengthy “Come onnnn!” Could the comeback be on? Third-set tiebreak: Murray 3-3 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray opens with a service winner before Nishioka misfires on a forehand to go a minibreak down. Nishioka pounds a backhand winner for 1-2, then Murray gives the minibreak back with an unforced error off the forehand side. After trading winners, they’re level at 3-all as they change ends. Third set: *Murray 4-6, 4-6, 6-6 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka falls behind 15-30, allowing Murray within two points of the set. But he wins the nets three points in quick order to force the breaker. Third set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 6-5 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray threads a pretty drop-shot winner, but follows it with three sloppy points to go double break point down. This could be it. Murray erases them both with back-to-back winners, but nets a backhand from the baseline on the next point to give Nishioka a third chance at a break. Murray saves that, too, then goes on to hold with a backhand volley winner at the net, but not after being made to labor for it. Nishioka will now serve to force a tiebreaker. Third set: *Murray 4-6, 4-6, 5-5 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka misfires off the forehand side in the opening exchange, but holds his nerve again in winning four quick points to nail down the hold. Third set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 5-4 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Squeaky bum time for the 2012 US Open champion as he opens with his third double fault of the set followed by an unforced error off the backhand side to fall love-30 down. He responds with a 125mph ace down the middle and a forehand volley winner, only to follow with his 41st unforced error of the day to gift Nishioka a crucial break-point chance. Murray survives when Nishioka mishits a backhand, then rattles off two quick points to escape with the hold. Nishioka will serve to stay in the third set after the change of ends. Third set: *Murray 4-6, 4-6, 4-4 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka answers with a stress-free hold of his own. No margin for error for Murray as he steps to the line. Third set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 4-3 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray badly needed a comfortable hold and that’s what he produced, winning four points on the trot behind a booming serve, including a 130mph ace down the pipe. Murray breaks in sixth game of third set! Third set: *Murray 4-6, 4-6, 3-3 Nishioka (*denotes next server) A glimmer of hope for Murray as he breaks back to level the proceedings in the third set. Nishioka falls behind love-15 and 15-40 before mixing in his fourth double fault of the afternoon. Third set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 2-3 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray keeps pace with a hold despite his seventh double fault of the day. He’s still grappling with that first serve, getting less than half of them in the court. Third set: *Murray 4-6, 4-6, 2-2 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Another love hold for the dialed-in Nishioka, who’s won 22 of the last 27 points on his serve. Third set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 1-2 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray comes through with an easy hold, but he will need to make some headway on Nishioka’s serve after the changeover if he hopes to extend this match. Third set: *Murray 4-6, 4-6, 0-2 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka wastes no time backing up the break, holding at love and capping it with a 109mph ace down the middle. Nishioka breaks in first game of third set! Third set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 0-1 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Yikes on bikes. Murray is quickly broken in his opening service game of the third set, double-faulting on break point. The path to victory coming into focus for the Japanese upstart. Second set: Murray 4-6, 4-6 Nishioka Three of Murray’s nine career fightbacks from two sets down have come at the US Open. He will need a fourth to reach the second round after dropping the second set moments ago to an in-form Yoshihito Nishioka. A somewhat flat Murray has chipped in nearly twice as many unforced errors (32) as Nishioka (17) while hitting five less winners. Second set: Murray 4-6, 4-5 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray crushes his sixth ace (120mph out wide) for 30-love. He immediately follows with his fifth double fault for 30-15, but holds from there to put the pressure on Nishioka, who after the changeover will serve for a two-sets-to-none lead. Second set: *Murray 4-6, 3-5 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka rights the ship with a mostly stress-free hold and Murray will now serve to stay in the set. Second set: Murray 4-6, 3-4 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray consolidates the break after soldiering through another lengthy service game that included his fourth and fifth aces of the day. Murray breaks in sixth game of second set! Second set: *Murray 4-6, 2-4 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Murray gets one break back in what can only be described as against the run of play. After opening with a backhand passing winner, Nishioka had won 13 of the previous 16 points on his serve. But Murray rattles off the next four, aided by a handful of loose points by the world No 49. Second set: Murray 4-6, 1-4 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray finds himself in trouble on his serve again, mixing in his 24th and 25th unforced errors as he’s forced to deuce. Nishioka nets a forehand from the baseline, but then uncorks a sizzling forehand winner past Murray as he comes to net for deuce again. The back-and-forth ensues until Murray is finally able to seal a hard-won hold after 12 points to get on the scoreboard in the second. Second set: *Murray 4-6, 0-4 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Murray pushes it to 30-all, but Nishioka follows with an ace out wide and forehand volley winner to back up the break. The Japanese southpaw has now won nine of 15 points at the net today. Nishioka breaks in third game of second set! Second set: Murray 4-6, 0-3 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray is deep in it now, falling behind a double break. Two more double faults early in the game allow Nishioka to push it to deuce. From there Nishioka forces Murray to net a volley, then watches as his opponent pulls a forehand wide from the baseline. Second set: *Murray 4-6, 0-2 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka, dialed in on his serve, cruises through a love hold to consolidate the break. Nishioka breaks in first game of second set! Second set: Murray 4-6, 0-1 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) A patchy first serve and too many unforced errors against an agile 145lb opponent who’s getting everything back. That’s been the story as bad goes to worse for Murray, who’s broken for the second time today in the opening game of the second set. Murray started with back-to-back double faults, then mixed in two more unforced errors on forehands to gift Nishioka the game. First set: Murray 4-6 Nishioka Nishioka misfires early in a rally to go love-15 down, but follows with his second ace of the day: 116mph down the middle. An unforced error by Murray followed by a forehand winner up the line by Nishioka gives the youngster a pair of set points. Murray saves the first, but sends a lob past the corner on the second to hand Nishioka the opener. Only six winners against 11 unforced errors for Murray, compared to 12 and nine for Nishioka. First set: Murray 4-5 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) An expeditious love hold for Murray capped by aces of 128mph (down the pipe) and 124mph (out wide). Now it’s on the 24-year-old to serve out the set after the change of ends. First set: *Murray 3-5 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka opens with a 115mph ace out wide, then races to a comfortable hold to back up the break. Murray will now serve to stay in the opening set. Nishioka breaks in seventh game of first set! First set: Murray 3-4 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray’s first serve is misfiring again as he falls behind love-15, then 15-40. He brushes aside the first with a punishing inside-out forehand winner early in the point from a step inside the baseline. But Nishioka capitalizes on the second, dragging Murray from corner to corner before putting away an overhand winner. He only one of six first serves in for Murray in that game (and 8-of-23 on the day). First set: *Murray 3-3 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Serving at 15-all, Nishioka shows off his retrieving skills, answering every posed by Murray over a 23-shot exchange. He follows with his first double fault of the day for 30-all, but holds from there with a backhand volley winner and a Murray unforced error from the baseline. We’re level through six games, but Nishioka has been made to work quite a bit harder on his serve. First set: *Murray 2-2 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka mixes in a pair of unforced errors from 30-15 and faces his first break point of the day. But Murray misfires from the backhand side early in the ensuing rally to waste it and Nishioka is able to hold from there. First set: Murray 2-1 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Another easy hold for Murray, who’s finding the mark with the first serve a touch better than before. First set: *Murray 1-1 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Murray rips a backhand winner to open Nishioka’s first service game, but the world No 49 wins four points from there for a drama-free hold. First set: Murray 1-0 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray’s first point in nearly two years in a grand slam singles match is a lob winner onto the baseline following a 13-stroke rally. He’s forced to deuce but holds comfortably despite getting just two of eight first serves in. Today’s forecast calls for showers on and off throughout the day. But the roof is open for now and conditions are pleasant with an on-court temperature of 73F (23C). The players are finished with their warmups and Murray will serve to start after Nishioka won the toss and elected to receive. Happy Tuesday and welcome to day two at Flushing Meadows. We’re moments away from the day’s first match in Arthur Ashe Stadium as 2012 US Open champion Andy Murray faces 24-year-old Japanese left-hander Yoshihito Nishioka in the first round. Since winning 78 matches and ending the year as world No 1 back in 2016, Murray has undergone two right hip surgeries and played a total of 68 matches. But his second-round win over world No 7 Alexander Zverev last week at Cincinnati-on-Hudson marked his biggest win since he beat then-No 2 Novak Djokovic at the 2016 ATP finals. The players have just now taken the court and we will follow with updates throughout the day. Bryan will be here shortly, in the meantime here’s how Novak Djokovic fared in his opener: Novak Djokovic got his campaign to win a fourth US Open, and 18th grand slam title overall, off to a flying start by beating Damir Dzumhur 6-1, 6-4, 6-1 to advance to the second round, where he will meet Britain’s Kyle Edmund. Djokovic broke Dzumhur’s serve for a seventh time to seal the win in the first night match on Arthur Ashe Stadium court, which, due to Covid-19, was missing the thousands of rowdy New York tennis fans that usually flock to Queens every year. Dzumhur, who hails from Bosnia and Herzegovina, had no answer to the world No1’s blistering serve and stout defence in a match that lasted just under two hours. The 28-year-old did not make it easy on himself, committing 41 unforced errors and eight double faults to fall to 0-3 lifetime against Djokovic. With the win the Serbian, who won his fourth title of the year at the Western &amp; Southern Open on Saturday, improved to 24-0 on the season. Afterwards Djokovic said: “Do I want to keep the streak going? Of course I do. But am I thinking about it as a priority every single day? No. But it’s there, it’s an additional motivation for me and it fuels me to play even stronger and even better and play to the right intensity in every match.”
16	The owner of Persil, Domestos and Cif is to invest €1bn in eliminating fossil fuel-based ingredients from its cleaning products by 2030. Unilever’s “clean future” initiative aims to develop renewable or recycled alternatives to chemicals derived from the oil industry as part of the company’s pledge to eliminate carbon emissions from its products by 2039. The investment in research and development for eco-products comes on top of €1bn Unilever has already committed over the next decade for environmental projects that will improve the “health of the planet”. The company, which owns more than 400 brands including Marmite, Dove, Comfort and Sure, has also pledged to reduce the mountain of plastic rubbish that its products generate. With nearly half of the carbon footprint of the consumer goods giant’s cleaning products coming from oil-based ingredients, reformulating with eco-friendly alternatives is expected to reduce their environmental impact by up to a fifth. A whole “rainbow” of alternatives, varying from well-established palm oil-based chemicals to those derived from algae, plastic waste and carbon captured from energy production, is being investigated. Peter ter Kulve, Unilever’s president of home care, said it was essential to investigate a diverse range of alternatives to “grow within the limits of our planet”. He said that Unilever hoped that by sharing details of its “carbon rainbow” – outlining the different possible alternatives for sourcing fossil fuel-based ingredients – Unilever was “calling on an economy-wide transformation”. “A new bioeconomy is rising from the ashes of fossil fuels,” he said. “We’ve heard time and time again that people want more affordable sustainable products that are just as good as conventional ones. Rapid developments in science and technology are allowing us to do this, with the promise of exciting new benefits for the people who use our products, from ultra-mild cleaning ingredients to self-cleaning clothes and surfaces.” This week, one of the first innovations will hit shelves in the UK: a Persil washing liquid including a stain remover derived from sugar cane. The Persil bottle will also now be made with 50% recycled plastic and has been redesigned to use less plastic, reducing the total virgin plastic by 1,000 tonnes per year. Cif cleaning liquid on sale in the UK is also to be reformulated with a cleaning agent derived from recycled plastic bottles. Meanwhile in southern India, Unilever is sourcing soda ash – an ingredient in laundry powders – made using a pioneering technology that captures carbon from energy production. Madhu Rao, head of home cleaning products at Unilever, said that the company intended to transform existing well-established brands around the world to make them more sustainable, bringing lower carbon alternatives into the mainstream. “We are on a big journey and this is the starting point,” he said. Rao said Unilever continued to see an “unprecedented level of demand” for health and hygiene products around the world during the pandemic as families spend more time cleaning and disinfecting their homes as they try to fend off the virus. But he said: “The heightened awareness around cleanness doesn’t take away the crisis everybody feels today – the climate crisis. The battle of our lifetime is climate change and consumers are very focused on this. Two-thirds of consumers want to buy more sustainable products and packaging that is sustainable.”
17	Microplastic pollution causes significant damage to populations of soil-dwelling mites, larvae and other tiny creatures that maintain the fertility of the land, research has found. The study notes that discarded bags, cups, threads and other forms of plastic waste are concentrated more in the earth than the oceans, with similarly dire consequences for the abundance of species that live below the surface. Mites, roundworms, springtails and other forms of microarthropod and nematode are barely visible to the human eye, but they play an essential role in recycling carbon and nitrogen and breaking down organic matter into a form that bacteria can consume. They are increasingly threatened by oil-based synthetic refuse. The new paper, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society, notes that humanity has produced 6,300 million metric tonnes of plastic waste since 1950, of which 79% has accumulated in landfills or leaked into the natural environment. The authors conducted what they say is the first ever field study of how this is likely to affect the abundance of microarthropods, nematodes and micro-organisms such as fungi and bacteria. The scientists divided a plot of subtropical land in Jinfoshan, Chongqing in China into six blocks, each containing four test areas. Each area was deliberately contaminated with four different densities of low-density polyethylene fragments: zero, 5, 10 and 15 grams per sq metre. After leaving the plastic to seep into the soil for 287 days, the researcher collected five samples and counted the species found inside. At the highest level of plastic contamination, they found a significant decrease of the most common species, oribatid mites (down 15%), and even greater declines of three other arthropods – Diptera (fly) larvae (down 30%), Lepidoptera (moth and butterfly) larvae (down 41%) and Hymenoptera (ants) (down 62%) – in comparison to the control plots. Among nematodes, they found a reduction of 20%. Although bacteria and fungi were relatively unaffected, the paper concludes “the effects of microplastics strongly cascade through the soil food webs, leading to the modification of microbial functioning with further potential consequences on soil carbon and nutrient cycling”. The authors call for further study at different depths and in other environments, but say the message for policymakers and consumers is clear: “We call for a reduction in the use of plastics and to avoid burying plastic wastes in soils, as this may bring adverse ecological consequences on soil communities and biogeochemical cycling in terrestrial ecosystems.”
18	A landmark BFI study has called for the film industry to step up attempts to address its environmental impact – including the possible mandatory reporting of carbon emissions. “It is clear that resource consumption and associated carbon emissions are underreported by productions, and in some cases not reported at all. The industry needs to take significant steps to change this,” concludes A Screen New Deal, the first wide-ranging survey since a 2006 UCLA study that has so far been virtually the sole yardstick for the sector’s ecological toll. Blockbuster films with budgets of over $70m (£53.5m) produce an average of 2,840 tonnes of CO2 per production, the new report reveals – a figure equivalent to the amount absorbed by 3,700 acres of forest in one year. Devni Acharya, senior consultant on the circular economy at Arup, the company that conducted the research for A Screen New Deal, says that an accepted standard for measuring a production’s footprint is still lacking. “The first step is to creating a consensus for reporting [emissions], and the second step is perhaps to make it mandatory,” she says. “But there’s a few steps before we get to that point.” The study, produced in collaboration with the Bafta-led consortium behind carbon calculator Albert, gathered data from 19 tentpole productions in the US and the UK, related to two different production companies, and interviews with 50 people from across the industry. But this data was anonymised; even for Arup, not just in terms of what was published, demonstrating the continuing reluctance within the industry to be fully accountable for the ecological side. Accusations have followed from this that current sustainability practices amount to nothing more than greenwashing. Around 51% of emissions were related to transport, the report found, with 30% of that accounted for by air travel and 70% by land. The rest was due to energy consumption, with 34% of the average blockbuster’s CO2 emissions going on mains electricity and gas, and 15% on diesel generators. The report is restricted solely to film production – and does not account for later stages in a film’s life cycle, such as distribution. With the current exponential demand in streaming video – responsible for producing 300m tonnes of CO2 in 2018, approximately the same as the national output of Spain – there is growing concern around its ecological cost. Acharya says the report focuses on production in order to provide the best possible blueprint for change in this area – and is hopeful this will happen. “I feel very optimistic, especially at this point in time,” she says. “Nations and specific industries are all talking about a green recovery, and we have a really unique opportunity to create change in the industry from here onwards. I hope the report provides real direction for that.” Many of the report’s recommendations on digital production processes, such as use of collaboration platforms for planning schedules and even shooting scenes, have already seen increased uptake during lockdown and as global film production resumes. The Russian production company Bazelevs has been promoting its platform Screenlife, which allows directors to stage drama inside a panoply of text browsers and video chat windows. In the UK, footage horror Host, shot using remote methods, has been a critical success. As well as such digitised methods, the report gives recommendations and case studies for sustainable practices in four other areas of film production: production materials, energy and water, studio building and facilities, and studio sites and locations. This guide has been designed to allow film-makers to address their ecological impact in a more systematic way that has so far been attempted. Many film productions currently employ eco-consultants to ensure their set is run on ecological lines, through the likes of recycling production materials. But their effectiveness is often limited, as the report points out: “In reality, the people appointed to these roles often lack the agency to integrate with the decision-making power of production managers, who perceive their recommendations as an imposition.” “One way to empower eco-consultants is to get them involved in the pre-planning phases, where key decisions are made: the sets to be constructed, how supplies are procured, locations,” says Acharya. “Getting them involved from the beginning where they can change those decisions would be really great.” The report expands on a previous BFI study, Green Matters, but such panoramic overviews remain rare, partly because of the difficulty of auditing a secretive industry. The €2m European Green Screen initiative, which ends this year, offers advice on good practice, but has not attempted to comprehensively measure the footprint of film production on the continent. The 2006 UCLA study estimated that Hollywood produced 15m tonnes of CO2 annually – though the industry has grown considerably since then.
40	Ronnie O’Sullivan holds an overnight lead in the 2020 world championship final, but both he and Kyren Wilson know that snooker’s showpiece event is there for the taking on Sunday following a remarkable fightback from Wilson. O’Sullivan leads 10-7 after 17 frames of dramatic but fairly low-quality snooker given what both are capable of. Leading 6-2 after an opening session in which there was just one century break and a litany of missed opportunities, a strong showing from the five-time world champion in Saturday’s evening session would have put him in complete control of the final, with Wilson struggling to cope in his first final and with spectators returned to the Crucible for the first time since the opening day. But as the evening rolled on, O’Sullivan’s form – already sketchy by his own high standards – collapsed, and Wilson eventually settled and managed to take advantage. He won five of the final seven frames to haul himself back into contention. Had O’Sullivan discovered his very best form the prospect of taking a commanding lead into the final day was well on the cards. But as O’Sullivan gesticulated over his lack of cue action with each frustrating miss, he began playing more and more erratically, affording Wilson an opening. Breaks of 75, 80 and 106 – a rare moment of quality in an otherwise stop-start opening day’s play – helped O’Sullivan win six of the eight frames in the afternoon session, with Wilson struggling just hours on from his dramatic semi-final victory over Anthony McGill. The trend looked set to continue into the evening, as O’Sullivan ground his way to the first two frames to lead 8-2, but a break of 92 from Wilson in the following frame swung the momentum. As O’Sullivan continued to toil, Wilson reeled off four frames in succession to haul himself back into contention. O’Sullivanreplied with a break of 82, before a century from Wilson made it 9-7. O’Sullivan’s day was summed up best when, looking well-placed to claim the final frame in one visit and make it 10-7, he got a horrendous kick on a simple red. However, he regathered himself to close the frame out and take a three-frame lead into Sunday’s finale.
135	Kamrul Islam doesn’t dare visit his local supermarket. Over the last few weeks, he said three of his closest friends fell ill with the coronavirus shortly after shopping there. One friend’s mother became seriously unwell after contracting the virus and died. The 40-year-old former cab driver says a day doesn’t go by when he isn’t aware of a death or infection of someone he knows. While the coronavirus has spread widely across the UK, the pandemic has taken a huge toll on the area where Islam lives, the east London borough of Newham, which has recorded the worst mortality rate in England and Wales. The borough’s rate – 144.3 deaths per 100,000 people – is closely followed by Brent in north London (141.5), and Newham’s neighbour Hackney (127.4), according to figures published by the Office for National Statistics. The data confirms what Islam has suspected all along: people living in the poorest parts of the country are dying from Covid-19 at a much higher rate than those in the richest. On Islam’s road and neighbouring street, 22 people have died after contracting coronavirus. “Every day I get a message from someone in my community telling me of people who have died. They are young and old. It’s been really tough,” Islam said. His wife, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “You hear sad stories of people dying and no one was with them. It does affect people mentally.” The deaths from the coronavirus include Betty and Ken Hill, who were together for more than 40 years and died hours apart; Dr Yusuf Patel, who was the fifth GP to succumb to the virus in the UK; “exceptional” secondary school English teacher Dr Louisa Rajakumari; and Abdul Karim Sheikh, the former ceremonial mayor who founded one of the first mosques in the area. The pandemic comes nearly a decade after the area hosted the 2012 Olympic Games, and has become a stark reminder that the better jobs, housing and quality of life that were promised have failed to materialise. Though parts of the borough have undergone regeneration and housing prices have rocketed, the legacy of the games wasn’t felt by all. Rokhsana Fiaz, who was elected mayor of Newham nearly two years ago, said: “I’ve grown up in the borough and lived here all my life. Like many of my friends, the opportunities that were promised with regards to the Olympics weren’t necessarily felt by me or my peer group. There’s a real sense of haves and have nots in the community. My promise has been we’re going to reverse that because everyone in Newham needs to have a stake.” The borough’s deprivation and diversity makes it particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus. More than half of children live in poverty, while the rate of households in temporary accommodation is one of the highest in England. A study commissioned by the council found that up to 36,000 people are not paid the legally required national minimum wage. Newham has the most diverse population profile of any local authority in the country. Some 78% of residents are from ethnic minority communities, which has been reported as a risk factor for the coronavirus. Many live in intergenerational households and there are longstanding health inequalities. Tahir Mirza, Newham resident and chair of the local Labour party in East Ham, described the deaths in his area as “truly shocking” and called for more efforts for people in the community to get guidelines on social distancing in their own language. He said many didn’t speak English and were simply unaware of the dangers they faced. The consequences of failing to reach these people will be dire, he said: “People will continue to die otherwise.” Dr Zubaida Haque, deputy director of the Runnymede Trust, said areas like Newham show the discussion about PPE and testing needs to go much further than just the NHS. Key workers, from taxi drivers and care workers to grocery shop owners, who are disproportionately from a BAME background, also require protective equipment. “BAME key workers aren’t just NHS staff. We need to start asking whether they are getting proper PPE equipment. Are they being protected? Are they being tested? Is that infrastructure there?” Peter Raison, a 58-year-old train driver for Transport for London who lives across the road from Islam, is also not surprised by the high level of mortality. Many like him on their street have to go to work and even he isn’t being provided with PPE. He is upset that there are people still failing to socially distance as the death tolls increase. “People are just assuming it’s not going to happen to me.”
136	My friend Peter Jackson, who has died aged 91, was a Labour MP in the time of Harold Wilson, contributing to a raft of progressive social reforms despite a short period in the Commons. Outside politics, he had a varied career that included university teaching in sociology, adult education and industrial studies. Born in Sheffield, Peter was the son of Len Jackson, an undertaker who became a rating officer for the Sheffield local authority, and his wife, Mary (nee Manyer), who ran a car hire company. He attended Nether Edge grammar school, where he took an interest in the Common Wealth party and read what was then the Manchester Guardian. Leaving school at the age of 16, Peter trained as an accountant in a Sheffield firm. He was conscripted into the RAF when he turned 18, and was posted to a Norfolk airbase, where a current affairs tutor suggested he should go to university. He went to Durham in 1949 to study sociology, with the aim of becoming a social worker. Instead, he left to take a teaching diploma at University College Leicester (now Leicester University), then registered for a PhD on John Stuart Mill while a research assistant at Liverpool University. He completed it in 1973 at Hull University. In Leicester he joined the Labour party, and became its candidate for High Peak in Derbyshire at the 1966 general election. He won the seat – its first Labour MP. He was the sole party member to vote against the Prices and Incomes Act 1966, which sought to stifle wage rises to control inflation, to the displeasure of Wilson, the prime minister. He was involved as a whip in the private members’ bills leading to the Abortion Act 1967 and the Divorce Reform Act 1969, as well as the Sexual Offences Act 1967 on homosexuality. He lost his seat in 1970 and went back to Hull for two years, before another two as a tutor at the Open University. I was the Labour party agent for High Peak at both general elections of 1974, including February, when Peter unsuccessfully attempted to regain the seat. He became a planning officer for South Yorkshire metropolitan council in 1974 but had a serious car accident in 1977. After recovery, he stood unsuccessfully as the 1979 Labour MEP candidate for Birmingham North. Peter taught at Roma University in Lesotho from 1980 to 1984 before returning to adult teaching for the university at Hull and at Matlock for Nottingham University. He was also director of the Access Committee charity in London, which was concerned with access for disabled people; and did work for a Welsh company manufacturing materials for the construction of houses for disabled people. He retired in 1992 but served on an industrial tribunal until the age of 70. Peter left the Labour party with Tony Blair’s leadership, but rejoined in 2015 when Jeremy Corbyn was elected. In retirement Peter and his second wife, Liz (nee Henderson), travelled often to Australia to visit family. He was taken ill while on a cruise and died in Panama. He is survived by Liz and his stepson, Paul Guthrie.
137	Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Global number of infections passes 3.2m According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 3.2 million people are known to have been infected around the world, while at least 233,000 have died. The figures are unlikely to represent the true scale of the pandemic due to suspected under-reporting and differing data recording and testing regimes. UK death toll rises to at least 27,510 The UK reports 739 more deaths, bringing the total death toll in the country to 27,510. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, says 177,454 people have tested positive; an increase of 6,201 since Thursday’s update. Of those, 15,111 patients are in hospital, Hancock says. US military develops test in potential breakthrough Scientists working for the US military design a new test that could identify carriers before they become infectious and spread the disease. Project coordinators hope the blood-based test will be able to detect the virus’s presence about four days before current tests can. Israel to partially reopen schools The country’s government announces it will partially reopen schools on Sunday, with a full return for all students by 1 June. First, second and third graders as well as 11th and 12th graders can return to school from Sunday, the first day of the week in Israel. Childcare and kindergartens, for children aged up to six, will remain closed for at least another week, the government says. US activists plan biggest rent strike in decades Thousands of people in the US plan to take part in a rent strike, calling for state leaders to cancel rent during the pandemic. Activists in New York, Pennsylvania and California are encouraging tenants to withhold rent, even if they are able to pay, to draw attention to the plight of those who do not have the money. India extends lockdown The country extends its lockdown – the world’s broadest by population – for two more weeks, but with some easing of restrictions in areas with few cases. The home ministry says that in view of “significant gains in the Covid-19 situation”, there will be “considerable relaxations” in areas with few or no cases. South Africa begins to ease lockdown Some industries are allowed to reopen after five weeks of restrictions in Africa’s most industrialised nation, which was already struggling with low growth and high debts when the lockdown began on 27 March. Its easing comes after the ratings agency S&amp;P downgraded the country’s credit rating to junk on Wednesday. US hands $50m Covid-19 aid to fossil fuel firms US fossil fuel companies have taken at least $50m (£40m) in taxpayer money that they are unlikely to have to pay back, according to a review of coronavirus aid meant for struggling small businesses by the investigative research group Documented and the Guardian. Japan extends state of emergency The country is preparing for a month-long extension to its state of emergency, its prime minister, Shinzo Abe, says. He imposed an initial month-long emergency for seven regions on 7 April, before expanding it across the whole country.
19	The UK has plummeted down the global broadband speed rankings to rate as one of the slowest countries in Europe, with a typical household taking more than twice as long to download a movie than the average home in western Europe. Britain has dropped 13 places in an annual study ranking the average broadband speeds of 221 countries and territories, placing it 47th fastest in the world. Last year, the UK ranked 34th for average broadband speed. The report, based on 577m broadband speed tests worldwide, now ranks the UK’s average broadband speed as the eighth slowest in western Europe. Consumers in 21 countries, including major economies such as Spain, Germany and France, enjoy faster speeds. For consumers that means digital tasks such as downloading a film to watch take significantly longer, with the average broadband speed in the UK less than half that of the western European average. In the UK it takes on average 18 minutes to download a 5GB movie to watch, in Spain it takes just 12 minutes, Sweden eight minutes and Switzerland six mins. The UK’s history as a global laggard in rolling out next-generation full-fibre broadband, which will provide internet speeds to future-proof the country’s homes and businesses, is proving costly. According to Ofcom, just over 10% of UK households have access to it, compared with above 80% in many developed countries. “The UK is comparatively late in its rollout of pure fibre networks, which is causing it to stagnate while other nations gain ground,” said Dan Howdle, consumer telecoms analyst at Cable.co.uk, which publishes the annual report. Many of the countries and territories that have leapfrogged the UK this year have comparatively small populations, such as Malta, Puerto Rico and Romania, and can roll out networks much more rapidly. “It is obviously easier to upgrade a country or territory to full-fibre the smaller it happens to be,” Howdle said. “However, the UK still finds itself a long way behind many nations of equal or greater size.” Addressing the UK’s laggard status was one of Boris Johnson’s first priorities when he was elected prime minister. He wants a complete “gigabit speed” UK network, a combination of full-fibre and other super-fast technology used in Virgin Media’s cable and broadband network, by 2025 and has pledged a £5bn fund to support services reaching the most remote parts of the UK. This article was amended on 2 September 2020 to clarify that population size was being referred to when describing Romania as a smaller country than the UK. An earlier version also suggested Puerto Rico was a country, rather than a territory. This has been corrected.
20	Employers need more help to prevent a “lost generation” of young people affected by the Covid-19 recession, despite the launch of a £2bn Treasury scheme to boost job creation for under-25s, a lobby group has warned. Against a backdrop of rapid unemployment growth across the country, ministers announced details on Wednesday of how companies can use the “kickstart” programme, which aims to create thousands of new jobs for 16- to 24-year-olds. Under the scheme, first announced by the chancellor Rishi Sunak in the summer statement, employers can offer young people who are claiming universal credit a six-month work placement funded by the government. However, the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said more action was needed to support employers, warning that urgent steps were required to prevent a “lost generation of young people”. As schools in England reopen and pupils return to classrooms for the first time in months, the lobby group said clarity on the government’s plans for apprentices and a renewed focus on technical education and skills were needed. “More must be done to ensure small firms have all the support they need to survive and then thrive after this pandemic,” said Mike Cherry, the national chairman of the FSB. “If more small businesses are unable to afford an apprentice, without the means to offer an industry placement for T-level pupils or provide a traineeship or kickstart role, we will be letting down the next generation.” Under the kickstart scheme, the government covers 100% of a young person’s pay on their relevant minimum wage, national insurance and pensions contributions for 25 hours a week. Employers can top this up further, while the state will also pay £1,500 to set up support and training for people on a kickstart placement. Sunak said the scheme, which will run until the end of next year with an option to extend it further, would “open the door to a brighter future for a new generation and ensure the UK bounces back stronger as a country”. The Treasury said businesses of all sizes, including household names such as Tesco, were looking to use the scheme and create quality jobs for young people. While there is no cap on the number of places the scheme can support, as many as 538,000 young people aged 24 and under were on universal credit as of July, while 700,000 young people are expected to leave education this year. Jane Gratton, the head of people policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the scheme would help firms take on young workers at a time when cashflow was tight, but that support would be needed for struggling firms. “To be successful, kickstart needs to create long-term, quality employment opportunities and ensure that both businesses and employees are fully supported throughout the placement,” she said.
21	We’re closing this blog now but you can follow all the latest news at our new blog here: Here the latest developments at a glance: South Africa’s confirmed coronavirus infections have surpassed half a million, the health ministry said on Saturday, while cases in Africa as a whole approached a million. The number of new confirmed coronavirus cases in Belgium has doubled in one week, as an average of 448.1 people per day tested positive for Covid-19 in the last week of July. Travellers entering France from 16 countries where coronavirus is spread widely must now undergo tests upon arrival at French airports and ports. At least 14 members of the US House of Representatives and Senate - seven Republicans and seven Democrats - have tested positive or are presumed to have had Covid-19 since the coronavirus pandemic began earlier this year. Several thousand demonstrators gathered outside the official residence of Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday, as weeks of protests against the Israeli leader showed no signs of slowing. 36 crew members confined on the Norwegian cruise ship MS Roald Amundsen have tested positive for coronavirus, officials said on Saturday. Nigeria’s commercial capital Lagos will allow churches and mosques to resume in-person services from 7 August, and restaurants, social clubs and recreational centres will also be allowed to reopen with limited capacity from 14 August as the state, the centre of Nigeria’s coronavirus outbreak, eases restrictions despite a continued rise in infections. The World Health Organization (WHO) warned on Saturday the coronavirus pandemic was likely to be “lengthy” after its emergency committee met to evaluate the crisis six months after sounding the international alarm. Ireland’s chief medical officer described a recent spike in Covid-19 infections as “concerning”, as the average number of cases per day doubled from around 20 in recent weeks to over 40 over the past five days. Spain’s labour minister, Yolanda Díaz Pérez, suggested on Saturday that the government would extend its coronavirus furlough scheme for an extra three months. That’s all from me for today. My vivacious colleagues in Australia will be taking over shortly and guide you through the next few hours of this pandemic. Thanks for reading and writing in, goodnight. The head of Mexico’s efforts to fight the coronavirus pandemic has sidestepped calls to resign after Mexico’s death count rose to overtake the UK’s as the third-highest in the world. Assistant health secretary Hugo López-Gatell expressed his respect to the nine of Mexico’s 32 state governors who called for his resignation, adding: “I hope we can continue to work together,” the Associated Press reports. Mexico reported 688 further confirmed Covid-19 deaths on Friday, raising its accumulated total to 46,688. The number of confirmed cases rose by a near-record 8,458, bringing Mexico’s total cases so far to almost 425,000. A letter calling for López-Gatell’s immediate resignation bore the names of 10 state governors, all from opposition parties, was made public on Friday, but later one of those governors said he had not approved the letter and distanced himself from it. The letter blamed the administration of president Andrés Manuel López Obrador for an erratic handling of the epidemic and a lack of efficient response that boosted Mexico’s death toll to the third-highest in the world while the country simultaneously suffered an 18.9% drop in economic activity in the second quarter compared to the same period last year. Mexico has imposed a very lax and partial lockdown of economic activity that has not stopped high levels of contagion, but has strangled the economy. Rather than testing or contact tracing, the government has focused on expanding hospital facilities. The federal government has given confusing and mixed messages about whether to wear face masks. López Obrador himself almost never wears one, and said on Friday: “I will use a face mask when there is no more corruption,” a reference to his administration’s anti-graft crusade, which he views as the country’s main priority. With millions of Americans set to lose $600 (about £458) a week in extra federal unemployment benefits – an economic lifeline during the pandemic – many thousands have yet to receive that money, Bloomberg reports. State unemployment agencies have been so swamped with claims that more than $100bn of benefits owed still haven’t been paid, according to calculations based on Treasury and Labor Department data. Those billions should eventually be distributed, even if Congress doesn’t act to extend the benefits, set to expire on 31 July. But the delays underscore the magnitude of the unemployment crisis unfolding across the US, as well as the daunting bureaucratic challenges of coping with it. Some out-of-work people have received only part of their promised benefits. Morgan Johnson, a single mother in Pennsylvania, said her extra benefits were halted because of suspected fraud, and attempts to contact the relevant authorities were unsuccessful as phone lines were always busy. She hasn’t been paid in six weeks and, she says, is on the verge of “losing everything”. Brazil recorded 45,392 additional confirmed cases of coronavirus as well as 1,088 deaths from the disease caused by the virus in the past 24 hours, its health ministry said on Saturday. Brazil has registered more than 2.7 million cases of the virus since the pandemic began, while the official death toll has risen to 93,563, according to ministry data. Prospective brides in England whose wedding receptions have been scuppered by new social distancing restrictions have turned to social media to vent their disappointment and fury at the short notice with which the new rules were implemented. Using the hashtag #whataboutweddings on Twitter, affected brides-to-be and people working in the wedding industry are lambasting the last-minute rule change, with many pointing out it seems unfair to ban wedding receptions of up to 30 people while regular parties are allowed to turn up in the same numbers at the same venues, such as pubs or restaurants, and air travel is permitted. On Friday, prime minister Boris Johnson announced with less than 24 hours’ notice that the decision to allow wedding receptions with up to 30 people from Saturday would be reversed. South Africa’s confirmed cases of Covid-19 have crossed half a million, the health ministry said on Saturday, while cases in Africa as a whole approached a million. Africa’s most industrialised nation recorded 10,107 new confirmed Covid-19 cases, pushing the total to 503,290, the health ministry said, four months since the first case was confirmed in the country. At least 14 members of the US House of Representatives and Senate - seven Republicans and seven Democrats - have tested positive or are presumed to have had Covid-19 since the coronavirus pandemic began earlier this year, with Representative Raul Grijalva becoming the latest on Saturday, Reuters reports. Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat, tested positive for the coronavirus but feels fine and has gone into isolation, he said in a statement on Saturday. Grijalva expressed frustration with the reluctance of some Republican lawmakers to wear masks, which can slow the spread of the virus. The Texas Republican Louie Gohmert, 66, a staunch conservative, said on Wednesday he tested positive in a prescreening at the White House but did not have any symptoms. “It’s really ironic, because a lot of people have made a big deal out of my not wearing a mask a lot. But in the last week or two, I have worn a mask more than I have in the whole last four months,” he said. Representative Morgan Griffith, 62, a Virginia Republican and member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said in mid-July that he had tested positive. His office said he did not have significant symptoms. The South Carolina Republican Representative Tom Rice, 62, said on Facebook in mid-June that he, his wife and son had all tested positive for the coronavirus but that all were “on the mend.” Mike Kelly, 72, a Republican from Pennsylvania, tested positive for the coronavirus in late March at a drive-through testing site. He told an interviewer that it took him about a month to recover and that he lost 30 pounds (14 kg). The Utah Democrat Representative Ben McAdams caught the virus in March, was hospitalised and needed oxygen. After his release, he warned others to take the virus seriously. “I’m young, I’m 45 years old, I’m healthy, I exercise every day and it hit me really hard,” he told ABC. Other affected lawmakers include Nydia Velazquez, 67, a Democrat from New York, the Republican Florida Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, 58, and the Republican Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, 57, who had said on 22 March that he had tested positive and was in quarantine. Several thousand demonstrators gathered outside the official residence of Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday, as weeks of protests against the Israeli leader showed no signs of slowing, the Associated Press reports. Saturday’s demonstration in central Jerusalem, along with smaller gatherings in Tel Aviv and near Netanyahu’s beach house in central Israel, was one of the largest turnouts in weeks of protests. Throughout the summer, thousands of Israelis have taken to the streets, calling for Netanyahu to resign, protesting his handling of the country’s coronavirus crisis and saying he should not remain in office while on trial for corruption charges. The rallies against Netanyahu are the largest Israel has seen since 2011 protests over the country’s high cost of living. Netanyahu has tried to play down the unrest, calling the demonstrators leftists and anarchists. Late on Saturday, his Likud Party issued a statement that accused Israel’s two private TV stations of giving free and endless publicity to the protesters and exaggerating the importance of the gatherings. While the demonstrations have largely been peaceful, they have grown increasingly violent in recent days. Some protesters have clashed with police, accusing them of using excessive force, while small gangs of Netanyahu supporters affiliated with a far-right group have assaulted demonstrators. Netanyahu has claimed demonstrators are inciting violence against him. Israeli police have arrested some 20 far-right activists in recent days and police said they were on high alert for violence at the demonstrations. The demonstrations are organized by a loose-knit network of activist groups. After moving quickly to contain the virus last spring, many believe Israel reopened its economy too quickly, leading to a surge in cases. The country is now coping with record levels of coronavirus, while unemployment has surged to over 20%. 36 crew members confined on the Norwegian cruise ship MS Roald Amundsen have tested positive for coronavirus, officials said on Saturday, according to AFP. The ship’s company Hurtigruten had earlier indicated 33 positive tests. Of the 158 crew members on board, 36 are infected, said Pal Jakobsen, media officer for the city of Tromso where the ship arrived on Friday, confirming a development that raises fears of a resurgence of cases in Norway. The infected crew are all Filipino, apart from three people from France, Norway and Germany. As we reported earlier, up to 17,000 people, including libertarians and anti-vaccination activists, have marched in Berlin to protest against Germany’s coronavirus regulations. Many flouted guidance on wearing masks and social distancing as they accused the government of “stealing our freedom”. While Germany had initial success in containing the virus, infections are rising and its R number has risen above one. Nigeria’s commercial capital Lagos will allow churches and mosques to resume in-person services from 7 August, the state’s governor said in a press briefing on Saturday. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu also said restaurants, social clubs and recreational centres will be allowed to reopen with limited capacity from 14 August as the state, the centre of Nigeria’s coronavirus outbreak, eases restrictions despite a continued rise in infections. Lagos state, home to the megacity of the same name with 20 million people, has more than 15,000 confirmed cases and 192 deaths, by far the largest share of Nigeria’s 43,151 cases, Reuters reports. It ordered widespread closures and a lockdown in March to halt the spread of the highly infectious virus. The lockdown was eased in early May, but Sanwo-Olu scuppered plans to reopen churches and mosques in June, citing a continued rise in cases. Christianity and Islam are widely practised in Lagos and the rest of Nigeria, and houses of worship in normal times often host services with thousands of people. Houses of worship will only be allowed to open for services once a week at no more than 50% capacity. Sanwu-Olu also increased the limit on public gatherings from 20 to 50 people. Nightclubs, cinemas and some arcades will remain closed. The number of new confirmed coronavirus cases in Belgium has doubled in one week, as an average of 448.1 people per day tested positive for Covid-19 in the last week of July. The number of new infections during the period between 22 and 28 July increased by 104% compared to the previous week. This increase can be seen in almost all provinces but in the province of Antwerp in particular, according to the Belgian national public health institute, Sciensano. New cases are emerging in all age groups, but most infections are occurring among people aged 20-59. As far as hospitals are concerned, last week’s average is 22 hospitalisations per day, which represents an increase of 21%. Last week, the number of deaths with Covid-19 in Belgium averaged 3 per day. According to Johns Hopkins University figures, 9,841 people have died so far from Covid-19 in the country of about 11.5 million people. The World Health Organization (WHO) warned on Saturday the coronavirus pandemic was likely to be “lengthy” after its emergency committee met to evaluate the crisis six months after sounding the international alarm. The committee “highlighted the anticipated lengthy duration of this Covid-19 pandemic”, the WHO said in a statement, and warned of the risk of “response fatigue” given the socio-economic pressures on countries. The panel gathered on Friday for the fourth time since the coronavirus crisis began, half a year on from its 30 January declaration of a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) – the WHO’s highest level of alarm. “WHO continues to assess the global risk level of Covid-19 to be very high,” said its latest statement. “The committee highlighted the anticipated lengthy duration of this Covid-19 pandemic, noting the importance of sustained community, national, regional, and global response efforts.” The coronavirus has killed at least 680,000 people and infected at least 17.6 million since the outbreak emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP. Countries around the world have imposed strict lockdowns in a bid to control the spread of the respiratory disease, plunging economies into sharp contraction. The committee urged the WHO to provide nuanced, pragmatic guidance on Covid-19 reactions “to reduce the risk of response fatigue in the context of socio-economic pressures”. The panel urged the WHO to support countries in preparing for the rollout of proven therapeutics and vaccines. The committee also urged the agency to accelerate research into the remaining “critical unknowns” of the virus, such as the animal source and potential animal reservoirs. It called for improved understanding of the epidemiology and severity of Covid-19, including its long-term health effects. The near six-hour gathering was hosted at the WHO’s headquarters in Geneva, with some participants joining via video link. The committee will reconvene in three months’ time. Going into the meeting, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the pandemic’s effects would be long-lasting. “It’s sobering to think that six months ago, when you recommended I declare a PHEIC, there were less than 100 cases and no deaths outside China,” he said on Friday. “The pandemic is a once-in-a-century health crisis, the effects of which will be felt for decades to come.” Marathon Petroleum, the largest US oil refiner by volume, plans to permanently close two refineries in Martinez, California, and Gallup, New Mexico, the company said, in response to lower demand for fuel. The company had earlier idled the two refineries following weak demand due to Covid-19 outbreaks in the US. US refiners on average suspended about 20% of total processing capacity when vehicle and air travel reduced. Marathon said it plans to use the Martinez facility, California’s fourth-largest, as an oil storage facility, and is evaluating its future use to produce diesel fuel from industry waste and used cooking oil. The company is scheduled to report its second-quarter results on Monday. Spokespeople did not immediately respond to request for comment on whether the closures would require a charge to earnings. Up to 800 workers face job losses combined at the 161,000 barrels-per-day Martinez and 27,000 barrels-per-day Gallup refineries beginning in October, the company said. “We do not anticipate supply disruptions in these regions, and we will continue to utilize our integrated system to meet customer commitments,” the company said in a statement on its website. Ireland’s chief medical officer on Saturday described a recent spike in Covid-19 infections as “concerning”, as the average number of cases per day doubled from around 20 in recent weeks to over 40 over the past five days. The country, which still has lower infection rates than much of Europe, reported 45 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, down from a two-month high of 85 cases on Thursday, Reuters reports. “Over the last five days we have seen an average of 44 cases a day. This trend is clearly concerning,” chief medical officer Ronan Glynn said in a statement. The British government said on Saturday that 46,193 people had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Friday, up by 74 from the day before. Separate figures published by the UK’s statistics agencies show there have now been more than 56,400 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, PA reports. The government also said that in the 24-hour period up to 9am on Saturday, there had been a further 771 lab-confirmed cases. Overall, a total of 303,952 cases have been confirmed. The Archdiocese of Manila will not hold any public religious activities in its churches and shrines between 3 and 14 August in response to the medical community’s call to revert to stricter quarantine measures, CNN Philippines reports. Apostolic administrator Broderick Pabillo said on Saturday: “We share the compassion of our medical frontliners for the many sick people being brought to our hospitals. So we support their appeal for a ‘time out’.” However, online activities will still continue, the administrator clarified. The Archdiocese covers churches in Manila City and nearby provinces such as Rizal, Laguna, Bulacan, Pampanga, Nueva Ecija, Batangas, Cavite, Bataan, Zambales and Mindoro. Earlier, health professionals urged the government to declare a two-week-long enhanced community quarantine in Metro Manila and nearby regions, saying workers are burning out over the surges of Covid-19 cases. Researchers also forecast that many hospitals in Metro Manila could become “overwhelmed” in the next two weeks as designated spaces for infected patients continue to get filled up. Travellers entering France from 16 countries where coronavirus is spread widely must now undergo tests upon arrival at French airports and ports. French prime minister Jean Castex announced last month that the tests would be required as of 1 August for passengers France is allowing in from a list of approved countries, unless they present proof of a negative test done within 72 hours of their departure. Those who test positive in France as of Saturday must quarantine for 14 days. France is not permitting general travel to and from the 16 countries, which include the US and Brazil. The testing requirement therefore only applies to people entering under limited circumstances: those who are French citizens and who live in these countries, or citizens of these countries with an established residence in France. Along with the United States and Brazil, which are reporting tens of thousands of new cases each day, the countries include Algeria, Bahrain, Israel, India, South Africa, Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Panama, Peru, Serbia, Turkey and Madagascar. France has had over 225,000 confirmed infections and over 30,200 Covid-19 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Spain’s labour minister, Yolanda Díaz Pérez, suggested on Saturday that the government would extend its coronavirus furlough scheme for an extra three months until the end of the year. Speaking after talks in Majorca with the regional government and union bosses, Díaz said it would make no sense to drop the ERTE furlough scheme when it is scheduled to finish at the end of September, according to AFP. “It would not make any sense to drop a protection system as important as the one designed by the government,” she said of the scheme that has supported millions of people. “There is no point in designing a mechanism that involves huge amounts of public resources then at the decisive moment ... we drop it,” she said. “The key is in the last quarter of the year,” Díaz said, indicating she wanted to send a “message of calm”. “We are not going to remove anything.” Her remarks came a day after Spain formally went into recession after its GDP fell by 18.5% in the second quarter. My colleague Stephen Burgen reports that in Barcelona, businesses are furious that, when infections started to rise again in late July, Catalan president Quim Torra announced a lockdown he was not empowered to enforce. By the time he explained that the measure was merely advisory, “Barcelona in lockdown” had gone viral and hotels and restaurants were reporting cancellations. A total of 3.7 million people benefited from the government’s furlough scheme between mid-March and the end of May, labour ministry figures show. The government also banned layoffs in the six months after the end of the furlough scheme, although cutbacks are expected. A commitment to fund such temporary unemployment schemes was one of the key measures put in place by prime minister Pedro Sánchez’s government to bolster an economy battered by months of lockdown. The pandemic also destroyed more than 1m jobs in Spain between April and June, mostly in the services and tourism sector. Spain’s unemployment rate, which jumped to 15.3% by the end of June, could rise as high as 19% by the end of the year, the government has warned, while the IMF sees it rising to 20.8%. Hard-hit by the virus which has killed more than 28,400 people, Spain has been struggling with a spike in new infections that has sparked European travel warnings and a British quarantine move that has damaged the fledgling recovery of tourism. At least 33 crew members confined on a Norwegian cruise ship have tested positive for the coronavirus, the company Hurtigruten said on Saturday. Arriving at the northern Norwegian port of Tromso from the archipelago of Svalbard, the crew of the MS Roald Amundsen was quarantined onboard the ship on Friday after four staff members tested positive for the virus and were hospitalised, AFP reports. Of the 158 crew members onboard, “33 tested positive for Covid-19, while 120 tested negative,” Hurtigruten said. Five people will be retested. The company said that four crew members “were isolated several days ago because of other disease symptoms, with no symptoms of Covid-19”. “There was no reason to suspect Covid-19 when the ship docked in Tromso based on the symptoms they were showing,” Hurtigruten said. According to the hospital, the four crew members are foreign nationals. The ship had nearly 180 passengers onboard since departing on 25 July. None of the passengers reported symptoms related to coronavirus during the voyage, Hurtigruten said. All passengers disembarked the ship on Friday but about 60 people have since been quarantined in Tromso. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health has not ruled out the possibility of more cases emerging but added more answers would be provided “once the tests have been carried out”. It recommended all passengers remained quarantined while awaiting their results. On Friday, Norway had 9,208 confirmed cases of coronavirus. One person died of the virus on Friday night, bringing the country’s total death toll to 256. It was the first coronavirus-related death in the Nordic country in two weeks. The airline and travel industry’s hopes of a recovery are crushed by new quarantine rules and travel restrictions amid a fresh wave of coronavirus infections in several countries, my colleague Rob Davies reports, as fed-up sun seekers are increasingly choosing to defer holiday decisions indefinitely rather than rebook for a later date. Full report here: Hello, I’m taking over from my colleague Aamna for the next few hours. Please feel free to message me with relevant updates or tips, you can get me on Twitter @JedySays or via email. Hundreds have ignored London mayor Sadiq Khan’s plea to stay at home and not attend the annual Afrikan Emancipation Day Reparations march in Brixton. Protesters gathered at Windrush Square in Brixton, south London, for the Afrikan Emancipation Day. A number of demonstrators temporarily blocked Brixton Road at the junction with Acre Lane, forcing cars and buses to stop and turn around, PA reports. Protesters, including some from Extinction Rebellion, occupied the middle of the junction until they were told to get back on to the kerb by police officers. Crowds of people listened to music in Windrush Square while a group of police officers stood nearby. A short distance away, another group observed speeches before a three-minute silence was held. A further four people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths in hospitals to 29,342, PA reports. The patients were aged between 78 and 84 years old and all had known underlying health conditions. Another five deaths were reported with no positive Covid-19 test result. Ending support for extremely vulnerable people shielding from coronavirus while pausing the easing of lockdown restrictions in England has been described by a leading charity as “perverse”. Age UK has said it no longer made sense to end the advice for vulnerable people to stay at home, since rising infection rates led to additional lockdown restrictions in parts of northern England and the pausing of further easing in the rest of the country. As of Saturday, more than 2 million people who are extremely clinically vulnerable to coronavirus are no longer being advised by governments in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland to stay at home, or shield. Many people have expressed concern that they feel forced to return to the workplace even though they do not think it is safe and the virus is still circulating. Caroline Abrahams, the director of Age UK, said: With a number of lockdown easements firmly on hold and millions under new restrictions in the north it seems perverse for shielding, and the supports it brings, to be paused as of today. There might have been a rationale for this pause when it was originally announced, a couple of weeks ago, but surely not now. Many shielding older workers, for example, are likely to be feeling distinctly nervous if they are required by their employer to return to their workplace on Monday. A third person died of coronavirus complications in Vietnam, AP reports, a day after the country recorded its first death from the disease. AP reports: All three died in a hospital in Da Nang, a hot spot with more than 100 cases in the past week, more than half of them patients. The Health Ministry said the latest fatalities included a 68-year old woman who was treated for blood cancer and a 61 year-old man who suffered septic shock and chronic kidney failure. The country’s first COVID-19 death was a 70-year-old who was admitted with a kidney illness. Da Nang is Vietnams most popular beach destination, and thousands of visitors were in the city for summer vacation. Across the country, authorities are rushing to test people who have returned home from the coastal city. Staff at a hospital in north-west England are to be rapidly tested for coronavirus to “control the spread of the infection”. Stockport NHS foundation trust said a “small number” of patients and staff had been identified as having the virus and that swift and widespread testing would take place over the next five days. A spokesperson said: We have begun a process of rapid staff testing for Covid-19 to strengthen our efforts to prevent and control the spread of the infection across Stepping Hill Hospital. Changes to lockdown arrangements across parts of the North of England reflect the prevalence of the infection in our local communities, and recently we have identified a small number of infections amongst staff and patients. We have taken rapid action to safeguard ourselves and the people who need our care. On Friday evening we began the rapid testing programme that over the next five days will see all our hospital staff tested. Staff found to have the infection will be required to self-isolate in line with national guidelines. Several small boats filled with more Tunisian migrants have reached a tiny Italian island that has run out of room to quarantine them as required by Italy’s anti-coronavirus measures, AP reports citing local officials. The Sicilian daily newspaper Giornale di Sicilia quoted the Lampedusa mayor, Totò Martello, as saying the island could not wait until the government sent a chartered ferry. The island’s migrant holding centre was built for a maximum capacity of 95 people and was already holding 950 when the latest passengers arrived, Martello said. The 250 who arrived between Friday night and Saturday must stay on the dock for now, until the promised ferry arrives or some other solution is found. The Vietnamese coastal city of Danang plans to test its entire population of 1.1 million people for coronavirus, the governing authorities said on Saturday, as 40 new cases linked to the tourist spot were reported across the country, taking total infections to 586, with three deaths. Reuters reports: Most of the new cases are linked to hospitals in Danang city, where the first locally transmitted infection in more than three months was detected last week. The Health Ministry said on Saturday that up to 800,000 visitors to Danang have left for other parts of the country since July 1, adding that more than 41,000 people have visited three hospitals in the city since. Local medical officials in Danang have conducted 8,247 coronavirus tests in the city since July 25, when the latest cluster was first detected. Testing capacity will be increased to 8,000-10,000 per day, the governing authorities said. Vietnam has detected new coronavirus cases in other cities, including Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, with links to Danang. Meanwhile, authorities of the capital city, Hanoi said late on Saturday it had carried out around 49,000 tests since Thursday after the city ordered mass testing for all people who recently returned from the popular coastal city. There have been 18 new cases of coronavirus recorded in Scotland in the past 24 hours, the latest figures show. These cases represent 0.5% of newly tested individuals, the Scottish government said. PA reports there were 260 people in hospital with Covid-19 and three in intensive care. No new deaths have been recorded among people who tested positive for the virus, meaning the total under this measurement remains at 2,491. Public Health Wales said a further two people have died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths in the country to 1,562. The number of cases in Wales increased by 21, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 17,279. Thousands of protesters against German coronavirus restrictions converged in Berlin on Saturday for a demonstration proclaiming the end of the pandemic – just as authorities voice increasing concern about an upturn in new infections, AP reports. A crowd of people whistling and cheering, and with few masks in sight, marched through central Berlin from the Brandenburg Gate before a rally on a wide boulevard that runs through the Tiergarten park. Protesters held up home-made placards featuring slogans that included “Corona, false alarm”, “We are being forced to wear a muzzle”, “Natural defence instead of vaccination” and “End the corona panic – bring fundamental rights back”. They chanted: “We’re here and we’re loud, because we are being robbed of our freedom.” Travellers entering France from 16 countries where coronavirus is circulating widely are having to undergo virus tests upon arrival at French airports and ports. AP reports: French Prime Minister Jean Castex announced last month that the tests would be required starting Aug. 1 for the arriving passengers France is allowing in from the listed countries unless they present proof of a negative test done within 72 hours of their departure. Those who test positive in France as of Saturday must quarantine for 14 days. France is not permitting general travel to and from the 16 countries, which include the United States and Brazil. The testing requirement therefore only applies to people entering under limited circumstances - French citizens who live in these countries or citizens of these countries with an established residence in France, Castex has said. Edinburgh Castle has reopened after the coronavirus lockdown, which caused the fortress to shut for its longest period since the second world war. PA reports: Historic Environment Scotland (HES) reopened the doors of the ancient stronghold on Saturday, along with other historic sites like Stirling Castle and Urquhart Castle. The castle in the centre of Edinburgh has long been one of Scotland’s most popular tourist destinations, but capacity will be reduced and some areas will be restricted in line with social distancing rules. Tickets must be booked in advance and face coverings will be required in the castle’s shops. In the past few weeks, Paul Feeley has been abused four times for not wearing a mask on public transport. “I have a disability lanyard, which signifies I have a hidden disability. I tried to show it … And all I got back was a complete torrent of abuse.” The most recent incident took place just after he first spoke to the Observer on Thursday. The abuse has made Feeley, who suffers from fibromyalgia, borderline personality disorder and panic attacks, feel “extraordinarily angry, anxious and upset”. He is unable to wear a face covering because of his medical conditions, and legally he is exempt – but he is now worried about travelling on buses and trams in his home town of Manchester. “One man said to me: ‘If you can’t wear a mask, you shouldn’t be allowed out.’” Incidents of “mask rage” are making disabled people who are unable to wear a covering fearful of going out in public, charities warn, as they call on the government to raise awareness about the legitimate reasons many people cannot wear them. The Guardian writer Jason Rodrigues is at the UK’s largest arts complex, the Southbank Centre, in London, where about 200 arts workers have gathered to protest against job cuts. Among the protesters was the actor Vanessa Redgrave, who called for “job cuts to end” across the arts. Last month, the Southbank Centre confirmed 400 jobs were at risk as it entered into talks with staff in an attempt to reduce losses caused by the Covid-19 crisis. The job losses are expected to affect all areas of the organisation, which comprises venues including the Hayward Gallery and Royal Festival Hall, as well as being home to eight orchestras, the National Poetry Library and the Arts Council Collection. Twenty-one new cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Malta, the health authorities said on Saturday, according to a report by Times of Malta. Most of the new patients are aged below 35, but one patient is 80 years old. It was just two weeks ago when Malta marked marked a week without new coronavirus cases, but cases have started to increase more recently. There were some concerns about the four music festivals that were planned over the next few months, but the large-scale music festivals were cancelled amid coronavirus fears. • This post was updated on 1 August 2020 because an earlier version referred to four planned music festivals, however those events have now been cancelled. Vietnam’s health ministry has said that up to 800,000 visitors to Danang city, the centre of coronavirus in the country, have left for other parts of the country since 1 July. Last week Vietnam detected its first locally transmitted Covid-19 cases in more than three months in Danang, a popular tourism spot. The total number of infections in the country has since risen to 558 from 413, with most of the new cases linked to three hospitals in Danang, after the country went 99 days without any new local cases. Twelve of the new cases were reported in Danang on Saturday, and there have been other confirmed cases in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh. More than 41,000 people have visited the three hospitals since July 1, the ministry said in a statement. Vietnam reported its first two Covid-19 deaths on Friday (see 3.54am) – both in Danang, where there has been more than 100 cases in the past week – as the toll rose to three on Saturday, Reuters reported. Fifteen other patients with Covid-19 are in critical condition, officials said. All have other underlying illnesses. Dr Kidong Park, the World Health Organization representative in Vietnam, said that Vietnam had been preparing for the possibility of wider community transmission, after the country reported its first case in January. The government has always been determined to ensure that its people are protected from Covid-19 by keeping the country’s relatively low number of cases and controlling the transmission within the community. The Afghan doctor who identified the first coronavirus case in the country has lost his life to the disease, as a US watchdog warns that Afghanistan is “headed for a humanitarian disaster”. Dr Ibrahim Basim, 64, the head of the infectious diseases department of Herat regional hospital, has died from the virus. Basim identified and treated the first Covid-19 patient in Afghanistan and raised awareness in the country about the pandemic. Officials in Herat province have already warned of a second wave of the pandemic. They said the flow of Afghan refugees from Iran, and the failure of the people to follow health guidelines, have increased the possibility of a new wave of the virus. The health ministry reported the total death toll stands at 1,283. In its latest update, the health ministry said the number of people who had tested positive for the virus had reached 36,710, an increase of 35 on the day before. There have been 25,509 recoveries, including 189 over the past 24 hours. A report by a US watchdog released on Thursday said the coronavirus pandemic was pushing millions more Afghans into poverty, overwhelming the country’s basic healthcare system and causing food shortages. The report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) indicated that only 300 ventilators are currently available across the war-ravaged country. The watchdog said the country was “headed for a humanitarian disaster” as the virus continued to spread. “The economic shock of the pandemic, including increased unemployment, food-supply disruptions due to border closures, and rising food prices, has exacerbated Afghans’ food insecurity, already impacted by the ongoing conflict and high poverty levels,” said SIGAR. It added that about one-third of the country’s estimated 32.2 million people were either in a crisis or an emergency state of food insecurity. The report says that testing remains limited, but nearly 43% of samples test positive, one of the highest rates in the world. Thousands of children in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania will return to school on 3 August. This federal state is the first in Germany to officially open the new school year, complying with health protocols imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Children will have to wear masks in the common areas of school buildings. The Philippines on Saturday reported 4,963 additional coronavirus infections, the largest single-day jump on record, Reuters reports. In a bulletin, the health ministry said total infections have reached 98,232, while deaths increased by 17 to 2,039. In the region, the Philippines is second only to Indonesia in coronavirus deaths and cases. Poland reported its highest number of new daily coronavirus cases for the third day in a row on Saturday, with 658 new infections, the health ministry said. Reuters said more than 200 cases were reported in the Silesia mining region in southern Poland, which has been grappling with an outbreak among miners. The ministry also reported five new deaths. Poland has now reported a total of 46,346 coronavirus cases and 1,721 deaths. “One thing is clear, the government is very worried about a resurgence of coronavirus in the UK,” Denis Campbell and Kate Proctor write. Read their damning report on a painful and chaotic week for the prime minister, Boris Johnson. Indonesia reported 1,560 new coronavirus infections on Saturday, Reuters reports, bringing its total to 109,936, data from the country’s Covid-19 task force showed. It also reported 62 Covid-19 related deaths, taking the death toll to 5,193. Russia reported 95 new deaths from the novel coronavirus on Saturday, pushing its national tally to 14,058, Reuters reports. Officials also reported 5,462 new cases of the novel coronavirus over the past 24 hours, pushing the country’s tally to 845,443. Prof Graham Medley, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said England could have to consider closing pubs in order to reopen schools next month. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: I think we’re in a situation whereby most people think that opening schools is a priority for the health and wellbeing of children and that when we do that we are going to reconnect lots of households. And so actually, closing some of the other networks, some of the other activities may well be required to enable us to open schools. It might come down to a question of which do you trade off against each other and then that’s a matter of prioritising – do we think pubs are more important than schools? He added that the rise in coronavirus infections appeared to be among younger people but warned there was a danger it could “spill” over into other parts of the population. He said: The age distribution of infections has changed, it has moved down into younger age groups and so it is likely we won’t see that increase in hospital admissions related to infection in the same way we did in March. But the big fear is the virus just gets out of control and we end up in a situation where there is so much virus that it inevitably spills out into all sections of the population. He warned the increased lockdown measures in areas across the north-west of England were “highly unlikely” to be the “last intervention that has to be done regionally”. “I fully expect that there will have to be other interventions at other times but what the interventions are really depends on what happens,” he added. PA has a roundup of the mixed reaction in the papers to Boris Johnson’s decision to delay lockdown-easing measures. The Mirror slammed the move as a “Lockdown meltdown”, taking issue with the perceived inconsistency of the government’s messaging. An editorial in the paper says: “What everyone wants is clarity and competence. At the moment the Government is failing to deliver either.” Meanwhile, the Express says the delay is an example of “Boris’s tough love”. The paper’s senior political correspondent Martyn Brown says the PM was “right to apply the brakes” to the easing of restrictions. He added: It is not an abrupt screech to a halt that would dramatically affect people’s lives but it will serve as a wake-up call that the battle to defeat coronavirus is far from over. To take action so swiftly and decisively will provide the nation with confidence and some reassurance in what are extraordinary and unpredictable times. The Daily Mail issues a warning to Mr Johnson not to “let this corona cure kill the economy”, adding in an editorial: “The Prime Minister described it as ‘squeezing on the brakes’. “It felt more like slamming the car into reverse.” The paper points to an Office for Budget Responsibility prediction that the jobless rate will peak at 12% by the end of the year. The editorial continues: If this is allowed to happen, with all the misery and heartbreak it would entail, let’s hope people don’t conclude that Mr Johnson’s coronavirus cure was ultimately far worse than the disease itself. The Guardian emphasises warnings from a number of experts that the delay “may not be enough to stop a rise in infection”. The Times takes a similar path, with the political editor of the Spectator, James Forsyth, writing a commentary piece under the headline: “If you think this is bad, just wait for winter.” The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, has paused new freedoms due this weekend, as people shielding against coronavirus can now leave their home and return to work. Johnson has warned the country could go into a new national lockdown amid fears any further reopening of the economy could trigger a full-blown resurgence of the coronavirus. The delay in the easing of lockdown raises fresh concerns for the up to 2 million extremely vulnerable people who had been shielding in England. Earlier this week, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) said it would be “heartless and reckless” for bosses to demand the immediate return of shielding workers on 1 August. Many told the Guardian of their fear of returning to work in person next week, while leading scientists said shielding may be ending too soon and demanded to see the scientific evidence behind the rule change. The delay in the easing of lockdown restrictions came with a warning from Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, that the country now appears to be “at the outer edge” of how far society can safely reopen in the age of the pandemic. “If we wish to do more things in the future, we may have to do less of some other things,” he said. “The idea that we can open up everything and keep the virus under control is clearly wrong.” Meanwhile, Labour and a leading welfare thinktank have called on the government to extend the furlough scheme for the hardest-hit industries as employers are forced to make financial contributions towards temporarily laid-off workers from this weekend. The Resolution Foundation said around half of the 9.2 million people placed on the government’s job retention scheme (JRS) since it launched in April have still not returned to work. It warned this group faced the prospect of widespread redundancies when the scheme, which covers 80% of workers’ wages, closes on 31 October, unless state subsidies are maintained beyond that date. That’s where I might leave you for now, but Aamna Mohdin is here to take you through the rest of the day’s news. Here is the latest opinion piece by Guardian columnist Andy Beckett: So much seems unusual about this Conservative government: its constant disruptiveness; its preference for rhetoric over functional policies; its mixture of brazen U-turns and cult-like discipline; its flirtations with the far right alongside leftwing-sounding plans to “level up”; its deadly reluctance to curtail small freedoms in a pandemic. It’s common to attribute some or all of these tendencies to the idiosyncrasies of Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings, or the effects of Brexit, or the rise of rightwing populism. But there is a less noticed and more surprising factor at work, too. Today’s Tory government has adopted some of the style, rhetoric and preoccupations of a defunct radical sect, the Revolutionary Communist party (RCP). The RCP was a tiny British party, founded in the 70s, officially disbanded in the late 90s. Despite its name, most of its stances were not communist or revolutionary but contrarian: it supported free speech for racists, and nuclear power; it attacked environmentalism and the NHS. Its most consistent impulse was to invoke an idealised working class, and claim it was actually being harmed by the supposed elites of the liberal left... You can read the full article below: For the third consecutive day, new cases of Covid-19 cases topped 1,300 in France. Friday evening’s figures showed an increase of 1,346 confirmed new coronavirus cases in the previous 24 hours and 15 new clusters, taking the total number of clusters currently under investigation to 157. The number of new cases, which had dropped to several hundred every day at the beginning of July, rose suddenly to top 1,000 a day a week ago, prompting health officials to warn of a resurgence of the virus. Although new cases dropped to just over 500 at the beginning of last week, they subsequently shot up again. A spike in cases in areas popular with tourists, including coastal resorts, has been labelled the “holiday effect”, by the French press. Health experts say 21% of the identified clusters have been sparked by families getting together for the summer after the strict two-month confinement, which ended on 11 May, and “temporary public or private gatherings”, including marriages. This figure was 14.5% at the beginning of July. Officials blame the increase in cases on people becoming less vigilant and abandoning social distancing and protection measures and say too many of those showing known coronavirus symptoms are failing to get themselves tested. There will be no updated figures over the weekend. The number of new coronavirus cases confirmed in Tokyo, Japan was around 472 on Saturday, a new record, NHK public television quoted Tokyo officials as saying. It was the second day in a row that the number of cases in the capital rose by more than 400. Although the Tokyo governor, Yuriko Koike, has said the city could declare its own state of emergency, the central government says there is still no need to do so nationally despite a record spike in several cities around the nation. Japan’s Okinawa region declared a state of emergency earlier on Saturday with people asked to stay home for two weeks as the popular tourist destination sees an “explosive spread” of coronavirus cases. A week is a long time in a coronavirus pandemic – a fact the UK government has learned all too painfully. Avoiding a one-week delay to lockdown in March would potentially have halved the death toll, it has previously emerged. Which goes some way to explain why there have been not one but two screeching U-turns this week – on travel to Spain and lockdown measures for 4.6 million people in northern England – both announced late into the evening and imposed within hours. The ensuing chaos and anger have been palpable, and all point to one thing: that the government is very, very worried about a resurgence of the virus on UK soil. Denis Campbell and Kate Proctor have all the details on prime minister Boris Johnson’s trying week below: Health officials in the Australian state of Victoria say there are now 1,008 active cases within the aged care sector, which has emerged as a key area of concern for authorities. It represents an increase of 80 new cases within that sector over 24 hours. Overall, there are 5,919 active cases in Victoria, after 396 were added to the total on Saturday. Of those active cases, 637 are among health care workers, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Of the largest outbreaks, there were a 10 cases added to the stricken St Basil’s aged care home, which now has a total of 134 infections, while another facility, Epping Gardens, added three cases for a total of 118. There are 399 people in Australian hospitals, including 50 people in intensive care units and 28 on ventilators, authorities say. The overwhelming majority of those were in Victoria. Australia’s deputy chief medical officer, Prof Michael Kidd, told a daily briefing on Saturday the country had surpassed 200 deaths after three people died in Victoria and a further death in New South Wales. Kidd also said Australia’s controversial Covidsafe app had allowed authorities to identify two new cases in Sydney. This is a timely reminder of the importance of the Covidsafe app. Kidd said the app had resulted in hundreds of additional people being tested and may have prevented a wider outbreak like those seen in Victoria. He added that authorities had received “disturbing reports” that people who had tested positive to Covid-19 were not at home when they had been doorknocked. He stressed that those who have tested positive must stay home. Workers at an abattoir in coronavirus-stricken Melbourne have been told to isolate until further notice after a staff member tested positive, fuelling fears of a possible second outbreak at the facility. In May, Cedar Meats abattoir was at the centre of the largest cluster in Victoria with 111 cases, but this record has since been overtaken by several second-wave outbreaks.A A Cedar meats spokeswoman said in a statement: We have followed DHHS’s advice and had all close contacts of that staff member tested onsite [on Friday] at our premises in Brooklyn. We have asked all of our staff to isolate until further notice, as per government guidelines. It is unclear if the worker was infectious during their last shift, but is understood they were originally absent due to non-flu-like illness and were tested for Covid-19 only in recent days. The results of the other staff tests will determine when the plant can reopen. Gambling revenue in Macau plunged 94.5% in July year-on-year, with casinos reeling from a lack of visitors in the world’s biggest casino hub despite a loosening of quarantine restrictions which have led to only a modest rise in gamblers. July’s figure of 1.3bn patacas ($US162.89m) was in line with analysts’ expectations of a drop of about 95%, reports Reuters. Casinos are staring at heavy losses for the second quarter, with not much hope for a near-term recovery as a resurgence in coronavirus cases muddies the outlook for when China will reinstate travel visas. Police in the state of South Australia have charged two people caught trying to cross the border from New South Wales. The 25-year-old man and 20-year-old woman tried to cross the border at Pinnaroo on Thursday, claiming they were headed interstate to sell a dog, reports AAP. They were refused entry and turned back to NSW, but police stopped their NSW-registered car in the Adelaide suburb of Kilburn on Saturday afternoon. The pair were charged with breaching Covid-19 directions and have been denied bail ahead of a court appearance on Monday. The arrests came as the state recorded one new case – a man aged in his 20s – of coronavirus. He had returned from interstate and has been in quarantine since his arrival. Authorities in the state of Western Australia say no new Covid-19 cases were recorded in the past 24 hours. However, two historical cases based on serology were recorded overnight, the Department of Health said in a statement. These cases are fully recovered and present no risk to the community. This brings the total case count to 668, comprising 640 confirmed cases and 28 historical cases. China recorded 45 new cases on Friday, mostly from outbreaks in the provinces of Xinjiang and Liaoning, the National Health Commission has announced. It comes after 127 new cases were detected on Thursday. The post was updated The elderly leader of a secretive South Korean sect at the centre of the country’s early coronavirus outbreak was arrested on Saturday for allegedly hindering the government’s effort to contain the epidemic. Lee Man-hee, 88, is the head of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, which is often condemned as a cult. People linked to the church accounted for more than half of the South’s 4,000-plus coronavirus cases in February when the country was enduring one of the worst early outbreaks in the world. Lee is accused of giving inaccurate records of church gatherings and false lists of its members to health authorities. He was taken into custody early Saturday “after the Suwon district court granted an arrest warrant at 1.20am”, a court spokesperson told AFP. Egypt reported 321 new Covid-19 infections on Friday, the health ministry said, the lowest figure since 3 May, according to Reuters. In total, 94,078 cases have been reported in Egypt, of which 39,638 have recovered and 4,188 have died, including 31 on Friday, the ministry said in a statement late on Friday. Egypt reopened resorts to foreign tourists on 1 July after tourism came to a halt in March under measures to curb the coronavirus outbreak. But Egypt has not yet made it to a “safe list” of countries for resumption of non-essential travel to the European Union. Japan’s Okinawa region has declared a state of emergency and asked people to stay home for two weeks as the popular tourist destination sees an “explosive spread” of coronavirus cases. Agence France-Presse reports that the governor, Denny Tamaki, on Friday asked residents to avoid non-essential outings following a record new daily addition to the southern island’s total cases, the majority of which have been detected among US forces based there. “We’re seeing an explosive spread of infections. We declare a state of emergency” through 15 August, Tamaki told reporters, adding hospitals were being overwhelmed by the surge. The measures are non-compulsory and without the aggressive enforcement measures seen in Europe, but similar requests from authorities have been widely respected in Japan. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 955 to 209,653, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Friday. The reported death toll rose by 7 to 9,148, Reuters reported the tally as showing. Chile’s president, Sebastián Piñera, announced $4.5bn in additional stimulus spending to help soften the blow of the pandemic and warned against a drift toward populism as people take advantage of a new rule allowing them to dip into their pension funds. In an address to lawmakers, Piñera said public investment in 2020-2022 will reach $34bn, of which $4.5bn had not previously been announced. The centre-right leader warned against populist solutions to Chile’s economic woes, which include huge inequalities and a recession worsened by the impact of Covid-19. “The entire world is being threatened by populism, which always offers the easy path of rights without duties, of achievements without effort,” he said, according to Reuters, warning against “promises of easy solutions to difficult problems”. This is Luke Henriques-Gomes returning to the blog. Thanks to Matilda Boseley for stepping in just now. This news is in from AAP: A man has been arrested at a NSW-Victoria border checkpoint after allegedly providing false information to police and then punching an officer in the face. The man and two women in their 20s were on Saturday morning in a car seeking to cross into NSW at Corowa when they were pulled over by police and defence personnel. Police say the two women presented valid permits and identification but the man, sitting in the back seat, did not follow suit. Subsequent checks found the man was wanted on seven outstanding warrants including one revoking his parole. The 21-year-old man then allegedly attempted to flee the vehicle and punched a senior constable in the face, causing bruises. He was arrested by other officers and defence personnel and taken to Corowa hospital due to suspected drug ingestion, with authorities seizing drug paraphernalia from the car. The man remains in hospital and is yet to be charged. My colleague Matilda Boseley will be taking over the blog for a short while. The latest case of Covid-19 in the Australian state of Queensland is a woman who may have been infectious while working at a Brisbane nursing home. The facility at Pinjarra Hills in Brisbane’s west had already been locked down after the woman’s husband tested positive on Friday, reports AAP. The health minister, Steven Miles, said extra nurses had been provided to the facility. All 150 staff and the residents at the home are being tested. “We are working with them to keep all residents safe,” Miles said. The woman is the wife of a 27-year-old Bellbird Park man who was confirmed to have the virus on Friday. We will have more on the situation in the Philippines later today. Doctors’ groups held a press conference just now begging the Philippines president, Rodrigo Duterte, for stricter lockdown for two weeks as they warned of the risk of health system collapse. “We are losing the battle,” one doctor said. Forty organisations nationwide signed on, including the Philippine Medical Association, and are calling for a “timeout” to fix systems. A second person died of coronavirus complications in Vietnam, officials said on Saturday, a day after it recorded its first-ever death as it struggles with a renewed outbreak after 99 days with no local cases. Both men died in a hospital in Da Nang, a hot spot with more than 100 cases in the past week, more than half of them patients, Associated Press reports. The Health ministry said a 61-year-old man died on Friday evening of septic shock and chronic kidney failure. The country’s first fatality was a 70-year-old who was being treated for a kidney illness. Da Nang is Vietnam’s most popular beach destination, and thousands of visitors were in the city for summer vacation. Across the country, authorities are rushing to test people who have returned home from the coastal city. Fifteen other patients with Covid-19 are in critical condition, officials said. All have other underlying illnesses. On Saturday morning, the health ministry confirmed 12 more cases, all linked to the hospital. Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro told a crowd in the state of Rio Grande do Sul on Friday to accept they would probably all catch the coronavirus one day. Bolsonaro, who has previously tested positive for Covid-19, said in an online video on Thursday he was being treated with antibiotics for a lung infection. According to the Brazilian newspaper Folha, the president told the crowd on Friday: Sadly, I think you almost all of you will catch it one day. What are you afraid of? Face it. Brazil has recorded 92,475 deaths from the virus, according to the latest statistics. US deaths from the novel coronavirus rose by at least 1,453 on Friday, the biggest one-day increase since 27 May, to reach a total of 153,882, Reuters reports. Cases rose by at least 66,986 to a total of 4.58 million, with some local governments yet to report. The rise in deaths was the biggest one-day increase since fatalities rose by 1,484 on 27 May. The death toll in Australia has exceeded 200 after three further deaths were recorded in Victoria and one person died in New South Wales. There have been 201 deaths in the country since the pandemic began. Those who died in Victoria were: a man in his 80s, a woman in her 80s and a woman in her 90s. The state’s death toll is now 116. In NSW, an 83-year-old man connected to an outbreak at a popular pub, the Crossroads Hotel in south-west Sydney, died on Saturday, taking the state’s death toll to 52. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has faced a grilling over reports that the families of people in aged care homes stricken by the coronavirus are unable to find out which hospitals their loves ones have been moved to. Andrews said the federal government was working hard to resolve the issue. I raised this matter with the PM, he is actioning this. I have not got an update today, this was yesterday or maybe the night before. I know they are working hard to try to have better call centre arrangements. We know there are cultural and language issues at play. That is not all of it, but that is a lot of the challenge. In the Australian Capital Territory, there have been no new cases of Covid-19 recorded in the past 24 hours, authorities have announced. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has said authorities are a “united team” after he was quizzed about a shake-up of the state’s public health team. The restructure includes Annaliese Van Diemen, the deputy chief health officer, returning to “her former duties”, while three new officials have joined as deputy chief officers. The Northern Territory in Australia has recorded one new coronavirus case, the health department has said. The woman is the partner of the man who tested positive to coronavirus Covid-19 yesterday. She is in isolation at the Royal Darwin hospital. In response to a call from the Australian Medical Association from all businesses except essential services to close, the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, says only that various options are being considered. What we have at the moment are numbers that are too high of community transmission and that is a concern to us. Andrews says authorities are working through what steps, if any, to take next. Victorian authorities are putting the focus on what the police minister, Lisa Neville, calls “appalling behaviour” from residents who have been found breaching the rules. Neville cites three cases: a person who drove from Melbourne to Wodonga on the NSW border “to buy a Big Mac”; a person who travelled from Melbourne to Ballarat for “fresh air”; and a person who drove across Melbourne, from Werribee to Springvale, to “buy groceries”. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, says he will not be announcing “further steps” today to curb the pandemic, but “we are giving due consideration to a whole range of different options”. When I am in a position to announce decisions, I will do that and I will take questions at that time. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has also confirmed there are now 5,919 active cases in the state, with 379 patients in hospital. There are 41 people in intensive care units, including 24 who are on ventilators. Andrews says the situation in the state’s aged care system is “very serious”. The biggest challenge is the growing number of “mystery cases”. There are 49 of those, he says. You cannot be certain if there is even more further community transmission, more mystery cases out there. That is in some respects our biggest challenge. Of the 397 new cases in Victoria, premier Daniel Andrews says are 37 links to outbreaks and other complex cases, and 360 are under investigation. The 397 new infections are a marked drop from the more than 600 reported on Friday, but Andrews warns it is still a significant number. While there is always a temptation to try and read trends into these numbers, there is a growing concern in relation to the number of community transmission cases within that data. Victoria has recorded 397 new cases of coronavirus over the past 24 hours, premier Daniel Andrews has announced. He says three further people have died: a man in his 80s, a woman in her 80s and a woman in her 90s. There are two new cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand, the health ministry announced on Saturday. Both cases are in managed isolation. The country has a total of 22 active cases, while there have been 1,212 infections since the start of the pandemic. California and Florida, two of the most populous US states, reported record increases in Covid-19 deaths on Friday, Reuters reports. Florida reported 257 deaths and California 208. In numerical terms, the loss of life in each state is roughly equivalent to the number of passengers on a single-aisle airplane. For Florida this is the fourth day in a row with a record rise in deaths and for California the second this week. Mississippi, Montana and Nevada also had a one-day record increase in deaths on Friday. Overall US deaths have increased by more than 25,000 in July to 153,000 since the pandemic started. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is expected to give an update at 11.30am, so in less than 10 minutes’ time. The government is considering imposing tougher restrictions after a horror week, including a record 732 new cases on Thursday. In New South Wales, the 17 new cases included three cases in return travellers in hotel quarantine and one NSW resident returning from Victoria. There were also two cases among people who attended at the Apollo restaurant in the Sydney suburb of Potts Point and two cases from the Mounties Club in Mount Pritchard. Officials said they had used the Australian government’s Covidsafe app to link one of the cases to the Mounties Club. Seven cases were close contacts of known cases, one case was locally acquired with its source unknown, and two cases were under investigation. The Australian state of NSW recorded 17 new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, NSW Health said on Saturday. An 83-year-old man has also died, authorities confirmed. The man contracted the virus from an outbreak at the Crossroads Hotel, a popular pub in south-western Sydney. Devastating economic data poured in on Friday as nations counted the cost of efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic, even as fresh spikes forced countries including Britain to put the brakes on a return to normality. Six months after the World Health Organization declared a global emergency, the novel coronavirus has infected more than 17 million people and killed nearly 674,000, reports Agence France-Presse. As global daily cases approach 300,000, the impact is being felt in every sphere of life, with elections postponed in Hong Kong – the latest blow to its democracy activists – and the annual Muslim hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia performed with radically reduced numbers. In a sign of the trade-offs being forced on governments, Britain imposed new lockdowns in several northern counties Friday, just as Western Europe announced historic economic slumps that would have been nightmare scenarios at the start of the year. France’s economy contracted by 13.8% in the April-June quarter, mirroring similar devastation in Spain (18.5 %), Portugal (14.1%) and Italy (12.4%). Europe as a whole saw gross domestic product fall by 12.1% in the eurozone and by 11.9% across the EU bloc. Mexico’s confirmed coronavirus deaths rose to 46,688 on Friday, health ministry data showed, placing the country’s death toll from the pandemic at third-highest in the world, overtaking Britain, Reuters reports. The health ministry registered 8,458 new cases, a record for a single day, as well as 688 additional deaths, bringing the total to 424,637 cases and 46,688 fatalities. The government has said the real number of infected people is likely significantly higher than the confirmed cases. Residents of the Australian state of Queensland have been put on alert about a string of locations around greater Brisbane that a man visited before testing positive to Covid-19. The 27-year-old Bellbird Park man is believed to have caught the virus when he ate at the same restaurant as an infected woman charged with illegally entering the state, reports AAP. The man is a direct contact of one of three women returning from Melbourne who allegedly lied on their border passes. He is believed to have caught the virus when dining with his family at the Madtongsan IV Korean restaurant at Sunnybank on 23 July. A Queensland Health spokesperson said in a statement: Along with five others who are being Covid-19 tested, they dined on a table adjacent to one of the recently identified cases who returned from Victoria. The premier of the Australian state of Victoria, Daniel Andrews, will hold a press conference at 11.30am local time. Andrews will report the number of new infections and any deaths over the past 24 hours and he is also likely to be asked about plans for further restrictions in Melbourne. Anaesthetists in the Australian state of Victoria are calling on the government to enforce “fit testing” for personal protective equipment, citing concerns that not enough is being done to protect health workers from coronavirus. Victoria reached 5743 active cases on Friday and deaths rose to 113, with three doctors among those reportedly in intensive care. Anaesthetists are commonly called on to intubate patients needing help to breathe, and so they are among those face-to-face with the most severe Covid-19 cases, reports AAP. The Australian Society of Anaesthetists says it has made “numerous approaches” to federal and state health departments asking that fit testing of PPE become mandatory in all hospitals. ASA president Dr Suzi Nou said federal and state health authorities had not been receptive to her recommendations for mandatory fit testing, despite the practice being widespread in other states. They’d say we don’t have the resources. Nou likened the lack of fit testing to former attitudes to seatbelts, which are now universal. Guatemala’s congress has extended a state of calamity for 30 days. The measures have been in place since March. The Latin American country has recorded 49,789 infections and 1,924 deaths since the start of the pandemic. In Australia, the state of Victoria is mulling further restrictions to curb the rise in case numbers. The state has recorded more than 1,300 new infections over the past two days, including a record 732 cases from Thursday. The state government is yet to announce new measures, but options could include the lockdown of certain industries where outbreaks among workers have been common, such as abattoirs, or a wider shutdown of all but essential industries, modelled on steps taken in New Zealand. Cedar Meats, an abattoir in Melbourne linked to a major outbreak earlier in the pandemic, has placed all staff in isolation after an employee tested positive. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is scheduled to hold a press conference in the next few hours, though any new measures may not be announced for a few days. In NSW, an exclusive members only venue, the Australian Club, was among the locations forced to close due to a positive case. The Bavarian, a popular pub on Sydney’s northern beaches, also shut following a hosting a Covid-infected patron. From 1am on Saturday, the Queensland border was shut to Greater Sydney. Two major drug companies will supply the US government with 100m doses of an experimental coronavirus vaccine, the Trump administration said on Friday, as the nation’s top health agency predicted that fatalities would rise in the coming weeks. The agreement calls for the US government to pay French drug maker Sanofi and British pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline up to $2.1bn to supply it with enough vaccines for 50 million people, with the option to buy another 500m doses. The purchase falls under the Trump administration’s so-called Operation Warp Speed, intended to rush a Covid-19 vaccine to the market by the end of 2020, Reuters reports. Researchers have raised fears that “systematic racism” in the provision of protective equipment is putting minority health workers at greater risk, as a study showed higher coronavirus infection rates among British and American medical staff. The report, published in the Lancet Public Health journal, found that frontline healthcare workers were over three times more likely to test positive than the general population early in the pandemic, with the rate rising to five times for ethnic minority medical staff. Researchers from the US looked at data from almost 100,000 healthcare workers in Britain and the United States taken from self-reported information on the Covid Symptoms Study smartphone app between 24 March and 23 April, Reuters reports. They found that the prevalence of infection among frontline care workers was 2,747 per 100,000 app users, compared with 242 per 100,000 in the general community, Agence France-Presse reports. When they took into account the health workers’ greater access to testing, the researchers estimated that frontline medical workers were around 3.4 times more likely to test positive for Covid-19 than app users in the wider population. After accounting for pre-existing medical conditions, researchers estimated that healthcare workers from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds were almost five times more likely to report a positive Covid-19 result than somebody from the general community. The study also found that frontline healthcare workers who said they did not have sufficient protective equipment – such as masks, gloves and gowns – were 1.3 times more likely to test positive than those who said they had the proper equipment. US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said talks with the White House on a coronavirus aid bill were far from a deal on Friday, as federal unemployment benefits that have been an essential lifeline for millions of Americans expired. Asked why she rejected a proposal from president Donald Trump’s administration for a one-week extension of the $600 weekly jobless payment, Pelosi said a short-term fix would be appropriate “if you are on a path” towards a deal. “We’re not,” Pelosi told a news conference. Negotiations were to continue on Saturday between White House officials and congressional Democrats, reports Reuters. Pelosi will host a meeting with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, an aide familiar with the planning said. Pelosi, the nation’s top elected Democrat, said she thought Congress and the White House would eventually come together on legislation,but gave no timetable. Referring to the mounting cases and deaths from Covid-19, Pelosi said: This is a freight train that is picking up steam. ... It must be stopped. In some of her toughest criticisms so far, she said Republican delays on legislation and “distortions” about the pandemic “has caused death unnecessarily”. White House officials took their own hard partisan line, accusing Democrats of refusing Trump’s proposals to extend the jobless benefit that expired on Friday and a moratorium on evictions that ended last week. Vietnam’s health ministry has reported 12 new local coronavirus cases linked to the recent outbreak in the central city of Danang, taking total infections to 116 since the virus resurfaced last week. The new patients, with ages from two to 78, are linked to Danang hospital, the ministry said on Saturday in a statement reported by Reuters. Vietnam has registered a total of 558 coronavirus cases and recorded its first two deaths on Friday after months of successful curbs. Peru’s housing minister, Carlos Lozada, said on Friday the government will extend the country’s state of emergency and quarantine measures until 31 August after infections rose, according to Europa Press. The ministry of health said on Thursday there were 6,809 new cases in the past 24 hours. Peru has so far seen 407,492 people test positive to Covid-19, including 19,021 deaths. The country has been in lockdown since March. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has put a scheduled easing of coronavirus restrictions on hold in England, as he also raised the prospect of a second lockdown. At a hastily arranged press conference at Downing Street on Friday, Johnson said he was pausing the reopening of leisure businesses, such as casinos and bowling alleys, and preventing beauty salons resuming close-up treatments, for at least two weeks. Rules on face coverings would also be extended for indoor venues such as museums, galleries and cinemas from 8 August. You can read a full report on the surprise announcement at the link below. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the continuing coronavirus pandemic, with me, Luke Henriques-Gomes. If you’d like to get in touch, you can do so by email via luke.henriques-gomes@theguardian.com or on Twitter @lukehgomes. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported a record increase in global coronavirus cases on Friday, with the total rising by 292,527. WHO warned the pandemic’s effects would be felt for decades as its emergency committee assessed the situation six months after sounding its top alarm over the outbreak. The death toll globally from coronavirus has surpassed 675,000, according to Johns Hopkins University’s tracker. The figure is now at 675,167, with the US having the most deaths at 152,074, followed by Brazil with 91,263. Dr Anthony Fauci, America’s top infectious disease expert, has told Congress he is “cautiously optimistic” that a “safe and effective” coronavirus vaccine will be available to the public by the end of 2020 during a hearing in Washington marked by testy exchanges between Fauci and senior Republicans loyal to Donald Trump. Brazil’s death toll has reached a total of 92,475, compared with 91,263 yesterday, according to the country’s health ministry. The country has registered 2,662,485 confirmed cases of the virus, up from 2,610,102 yesterday. Jair Bolsanaro, who has previously tested positive to Covid019, said he was taking antibiotics for a lung infection. Health authorities in France reported 1,346 new confirmed coronavirus infections on Friday, which took the total to 187,919. New cases are above 1,300 per day for the third day in a row, the highest since late April. In Australia, authorities are mulling further restrictions in the state of Victoria, which has recorded more than 1,300 new infections over the past two days.
22	HSBC’s chief executive, Noel Quinn, will be steeling himself for a grilling on Monday, as the bank’s support for China’s controversial security laws in Hong Kong and alleged role in the arrest of a Huawei executive threaten to dominate its second-quarter results. The company, which has its global headquarters in London but makes the majority of its profits in Hong Kong and China, will be the last major UK bank to publish earnings next week. But while HSBC is likely to report Covid-19 loan loss charges worth $2.7bn (£2bn) – more than the $2.5bn (£1.9bn) it is expected to make in pre-tax profits – the impact of the virus will be one of the easier topics to tackle as the bank juggles competing geopolitical controversies. Quinn, an HSBC lifer who formally took over as chief executive in March, is likely to choose his words carefully. HSBC has traditionally remained neutral on China, but it was on Quinn’s watch, in early June, that the bank gave its backing for Beijing’s new rules. It said: “We respect and support laws and regulations that will enable Hong Kong to recover and rebuild the economy and, at the same time, maintain the principle of ‘one country, two systems.’” HSBC’s Asia Pacific chief executive, Peter Wong, signed a petition supporting Beijing’s new rules. The message immediately sparked controversy, with politicians in London and Washington condemning the bank’s support for the anti-democratic laws which, critics said, would undermine Hong Kong’s autonomy under the one country, two systems framework. Labour frontbenchers chastised HSBC, saying that the laws it had openly backed violated joint declaration treaty commitments between the UK and China, and limited freedoms for Hong Kong citizens. They also warned that the bank risked being the subject of boycotts similar to those aimed in the 1980s at companies that continued to do business in South Africa during the apartheid era. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, later told parliament that the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong citizens “should not be sacrificed on the altar of bankers’ bonuses”. In Washington, the House of Representatives passed legislation targeting key Chinese officials, putting banks who do business with Chinese authorities at risk of sanctions. This came weeks after the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, called HSBC’s endorsement of the security law a “corporate kowtow”. Pompeo claimed HSBC’s efforts had been in vain and earned it no respect in Beijing, after China reportedly threatened to punish the bank if the UK blocked technology firm Huawei from involvement in building its 5G network. He warned that HSBC would continue to be used as political leverage by the Chinese Communist party. The tit-for-tat retaliation between the west and Beijing continues, and HSBC is still caught in the middle, despite remaining tight-lipped. In July, China’s Global Times newspaper – a hawkish state mouthpiece – said China would counter UK moves to suspend an extradition treaty with Hong Kong by targeting companies such as Jaguar Land Rover and HSBC. Last week, HSBC was forced to rubbish claims by Chinese state media that it had framed Huawei and been an accomplice in US efforts to arrest its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, in Canada in late 2018. In its statement, posted on the WeChat Chinese social media platform, the bank said it had handed over documents to the US Department of Justice only after it was ordered to do so. HSBC is now walking a precarious line between offending China – which is its most lucrative market – and losing the support of the UK and other western states. Few of Quinn’s banking rivals would fancy being in his shoes.

28	Boston Red Sox ace Eduardo Rodríguez will miss the rest of the 2020 season as he recovers from a heart issue the team believes is related to the pitcher’s recent battle with the coronavirus. The 27-year-old left-hander, the team’s presumptive No 1 starter who had been expected to start on opening day before he was sidelined, has been diagnosed with myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart that has been found at a high rate in recovered coronavirus patients. Rodríguez tested positive for the virus before flying to Boston for an abbreviated training camp in early July, describing symptoms including headaches, nausea and a high fever. After recovering and joining the club, he was diagnosed with the temporary ailment. “We are confident that he’s going to make a full recovery and that his longterm prognosis is excellent, but the fact of the matter is there’s just just not enough time left this season to safely ramp him back up to pitching,” Red Sox chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom said. Rodriguez had said last Sunday that his doctors told him that 10-20% of people who have had Covid-19 also have been diagnosed with myocarditis. “That’s the most important part of your body, so when you hear that, the first time I hear it was kind of scared a little,’’ Rodriguez said. “Now that I know what it is, it’s still scary, but I know exactly what it is. Just talk to my mom, talk to my wife, they know what I have and everything. Now we just gotta take the rest. That’s hard, but you gotta take a rest.” The Venezuela native is coming off his best major league campaign. Rodriguez posted a 19-6 record with a 3.81 ERA in 2019 and set career highs in wins, ERA, innings (203 1/3), starts (34) and strikeouts (213). The announcement from the Red Sox came hours after the coronavirus forced baseball’s 18th postponement in 10 days on Saturday, prompting at least two more players to opt out of the season entirely and casting doubt the league can complete the truncated season it started less than two weeks ago.
29	We’ll be shutting down today’s blog shortly. Here’s a glance at today’s major news items: Trump claims Anthony Fauci ‘wrong’ about cause of Covid-19 surge. The US president launched an extraordinary attack on his own top infectious disease expert, arguing against the doctor’s claim that high rates of infection in the US stem from a less aggressive reaction to the virus in terms of economic shutdowns and stay-at-home orders. Florida closes beaches as Hurricane Isaias barrels through Bahamas. Hurricane Isaias ripped shingles off roofs and blew over trees as it carved its way through the Bahamas early on Saturday and headed toward the Florida coast, where officials in Miami said they were closing beaches, marinas and parks. Democratic congressman issues blistering attack on Republicans after Covid-19 diagnosis. Arizona Democrat Raúl Grijalva, who revealed Saturday he tested positive for the coronavirus, has condemned Republican politicians for their carelessness around Congress and blamed them for spreading the virus. Trump heads to his own golf club as Covid-19 surges and jobless benefits expire. The US president prompted a familiar barrage of criticism on Saturday by visiting one of his own golf clubs as the country remains caught in numerous intensifying crises from the raging coronavirus epidemic to anti-racism protests to the failure to extend benefits to tens of millions of jobless Americans. UK lobbies US to support controversial new nuclear warheads. The UK has been lobbying Congress in support of a controversial new warhead for Trident missiles, claiming it is critical for “the future of Nato as a nuclear alliance”. Portland: 1,000 peacefully protest amid withdrawal of federal agents. More than a thousand people showed up in downtown Portland early on Saturday to peacefully protest, about three days after the announcement that the presence of US agents there would be reduced. Texas ‘wide open for business’ despite surge in Covid-19 cases. Four months into the pandemic a mandatory mask order is finally in place in the Lone Star state, but some express concern that it’s too little, too late. Trump impeachment witness says nation’s values under threat. Lt Col Alexander Vindman, the 21-year US army veteran who reported concerns about Trump’s 2019 phone call to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to fellow members of the National Security Council, has written an op-ed in the Washington Post condemning the US president. The coronavirus forced baseball’s 17th postponement in 10 days on Saturday, prompting at least two more players to opt out of the season entirely and casting doubt on whether the league can complete a truncated 2020 season. A game between the Cardinals and Brewers in Milwaukee was postponed for the second straight day after one more player and three staff members with St Louis tested positive for the coronavirus. Friday’s series opener between the midwestern rivals had been scuttled only hours before the first pitch due to two Cardinals players testing positive. Major League Baseball said Thursday it was updating its coronavirus safety measures after a 17th player on the Miami Marlins tested positive for Covid-19, a mere seven days after all 30 clubs opened a shortened, delayed season in empty stadiums. The Marlins outbreak, which first came to light on Monday after the team played a three-game series on the road against the Philadelphia Phillies, prompted MLB to postpone all of the team’s games through at least Sunday amid doubts the team will be able to reopen its season as planned Tuesday at home. Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred has reportedly ordered all teams to use surgical masks instead of cloth ones, encouraged players not to leave hotels in road cities except for games and mandated every club to travel with a virus protocol compliance officer to ensure rules are followed. According to an ESPN report, Manfred has warned players union’ executive director Tony Clark that baseball could shut down for the season if it doesn’t do a better job of managing the spread. Dr Anthony Fauci, the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the US’s top infectious disease expert, expressed concern over the outbreak when asked about it during an appearance on ABC’s Good Morning America on Tuesday morning. “This could put [the season] in danger,” Fauci said. “I don’t believe they need to stop, but we just need to follow this and see what happens with other teams on a day-by-day basis.” The pandemic had already forced MLB to delay and truncate the familiar 162-game, six-month season to a 60-game, 67-day sprint with a number of rule changes designed to speed up the game and protect the players and umpires. On Saturday, Miami second baseman Isan Diaz and two-time All-Star center fielder Lorenzo Cain of the Brewers became the latest of the more than a dozen major leaguers to opt out of the season entirely, citing the health risks stemming from Covid-19. Others who are playing, like Washington Nationals relief pitcher Sean Doolittle, have expressed ambivalence over baseball’s return as case numbers continue to surge throughout the country. “We’re trying to bring baseball back during a pandemic that’s killed 130,000 people,” Doolittle said on 5 July. “We’re way worse off as a country than we were in March when we shut this thing down. And, like, look where the other developed countries are in their response to this. We haven’t done any of the things that other countries have done to bring sports back. “Sports are like the reward of a functioning society. And we’re trying to just bring it back, even though we’ve taken none of the steps to flatten the curve.” At least 14 members of the House of Representatives and Senate – seven Republicans and seven Democrats – have tested positive or are presumed to have had Covid-19 since the start of the coronavirus pandemic after Arizona’s Raúl Grijalva and Texas’s Louie Gohmert became the latest this week, Reuters reports. Representative Morgan Griffith, 62, a Virginia Republican and member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said in mid-July that he had tested positive. His office said he did not have significant symptoms. The South Carolina Republican representative Tom Rice, 62, said on Facebook in mid-June that he, his wife and his son had all tested positive for the coronavirus but that all were “on the mend”. The Utah Democratic representative Ben McAdams caught the virus in March, was hospitalized and needed oxygen. After his release, he warned others to take the virus seriously. “I’m young, I’m 45 years old, I’m healthy, I exercise every day and it hit me really hard,” he told ABC. Other affected lawmakers include Nydia Velazquez, 67, a Democrat from New York, the Massachusetts Democrat Seth Moulton, 41, the Republican Florida representative Mario Díaz-Balart, 58, and the Republican Kentucky senator Rand Paul, 57, who had said on 22 March that he had tested positive and was in quarantine. Arizona congressman Raúl Grijalva, who said Saturday he tested positive for the coronavirus, has condemned Republican politicians for their carelessness around Congress and blamed them for spreading the virus. The Democratic representative issued the fiery condemnation from self-quarantine at his residence in the Washington area. “While I cannot blame anyone directly for this, this week has shown that there are some members of Congress who fail to take this crisis seriously,” he said. “Numerous Republican members routinely strut around the Capitol without a mask to selfishly make a political statement at the expense of their colleagues, staff, and their families.” The attack comes after Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican who has frequently refused to wear a mask, tested positive for coronavirus last week. In shunning a mask, Gohmert is following the lead of Donald Trump, who is rarely seen wearing one either in the White House or on presidential visits. Grijalva had presided over a hearing of the House Natural Resources Committee which Gohmert attended on Tuesday. In a TV interview after the diagnosis, Gohmert even suggested he may have contracted coronavirus by incorrectly wearing his mask. “I can’t help but wonder if by keeping a mask on and keeping it in place, that if I might have put some germs or some of the virus on to the mask and breathed it in,” Gohmert said. The World Health Organization (WHO) warned on Saturday the coronavirus pandemic was likely to be “lengthy” after its emergency committee met to evaluate the crisis six months after sounding the international alarm. The committee “highlighted the anticipated lengthy duration of this Covid-19 pandemic”, the WHO said in a statement, and warned of the risk of “response fatigue” given the socio-economic pressures on countries. The panel gathered on Friday for the fourth time since the coronavirus crisis began, half a year on from its 30 January declaration of a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) – the WHO’s highest level of alarm. “WHO continues to assess the global risk level of Covid-19 to be very high,” said its latest statement. “The committee highlighted the anticipated lengthy duration of this Covid-19 pandemic, noting the importance of sustained community, national, regional, and global response efforts.” The coronavirus has killed at least 680,000 people and infected at least 17.6 million since the outbreak emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP. Mexico also overtook Britain to became the third hardest hit country for virus deaths after Brazil and the US with over 46,600 fatal cases. Going into the meeting, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the pandemic’s effects would be long-lasting. “It’s sobering to think that six months ago, when you recommended I declare a PHEIC, there were less than 100 cases and no deaths outside China,” he said on Friday. “The pandemic is a once-in-a-century health crisis, the effects of which will be felt for decades to come.” Donald Trump has again publicly contradicted Dr Anthony Fauci, claiming the US’s top infectious disease expert is “wrong” to attribute the surge in US coronavirus cases to the country’s failure to sufficiently shut down its economy. The US president came in hot on Saturday after a lengthy-for-him 15-hour hiatus from Twitter, responding to a clip of Fauci’s testimony before Congress from Friday with the largely debunked claim that Covid-19 cases in the US are surging exclusively due to increased testing. “Wrong!” Trump said. “We have more cases because we have tested far more than any other country, 60,000,000. If we tested less, there would be less cases. How did Italy, France &amp; Spain do? Now Europe sadly has flare ups. Most of our governors worked hard &amp; smart. We will come back STRONG!” Fauci, a key member of the White House coronavirus task force, had made the claim before the House’s special select committee investigating the Trump administration’s response to the pandemic. “When they shut down, they shut down to the tune of about 95%, getting their baseline down to tens or hundreds of cases a day,” he told the House panel, adding that only about 50% of the United States shut down against a much higher baseline of daily cases. The idea that case numbers are high only because diagnostic testing has expended has been continually shot down by Trump’s own top public health officials, as the increase has also revealed the percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus is climbing across nearly the entire country. “A high rate of positive tests indicates a government is only testing the sickest patients who seek out medical attention and is not casting a wide enough net,” according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center, a primary source of updated information on the pandemic. The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is removing its top intelligence official from his post after it was revealed the office has been surveilling the work of American journalists reporting on the unrest in Portland, circulating “intelligence reports” on them to other federal agencies in a move that has been decried as a clear violation of the constitutional right to a free press. Brian Murphy, who has been the acting chief of a unit known as the “office of intelligence and analysis”, is being removed from that role at the behest of acting DHS secretary Chad Wolf, Politco reported on Saturday. The department has faced criticism since the Washington Post revealed on Thursday that the intelligence reports, which referred specifically to two prominent US journalists whose reporting had revealed the disarray within the Trump administration’s contentious deployment of federal agents to Portland, were distributed in the past week to law enforcement and other agencies. One of the journalists, Mike Baker of the New York Times, had disclosed a leaked DHS memo that discussed the confusion prevalent among the federal agents sent to Portland. The memo showed that the camouflaged officers had little understanding of the nature of the demonstrations they were being asked to police. As our Washington bureau chief David Smith has written, members of the media have become targets for both police and protesters in cities across the country amid this summer’s national uprising. Donald Trump departed his golf club in Virginia at 1.57pm, according to the White House press pool. Demonstrators gathered outside the Loudoun county property in what’s become a regular occurrence as the president’s twice-weekly visits have continued over the past several months. A much larger crowd was assembled as the motorcade departed en route to the White House compared to when the US president arrived. A number of Trump supporters holding “Trump-Pence” placards stood one side of the street, while protesters with “Biden for President” signs gathered on the opposite side. Nearer to the protesters’ side, “TRUMP KILLED HERMAN CAIN” was written on the ground in chalk. CNN, which tallies Trump trips to his golf clubs, reported that the visit was Trump’s 283th trip to a golf course while in office and his 376th day at a Trump property. The motorcade arrived back at the White House at 2.36pm. The president has no public events scheduled for the rest of the day (or Sunday). More than a thousand people showed up in downtown Portland early Saturday to peacefully protest in the wake of an announcement that the presence of federal agents in Oregon’s largest city would be reduced. The Associated Press reports: Friday’s overnight protest mimicked that of Thursday, which was the first time in weeks that demonstrations ended without any major confrontations, violence or arrests. The change in tone outside a federal courthouse that’s become ground zero in clashes between demonstrators and federal agents came after the US government began drawing down its forces in the liberal city under a deal between Democratic governor Kate Brown and the Trump administration. As of midnight on Saturday, no federal agents had emerged from the courthouse, which has been the center of protests for weeks, and there was no noticeable law enforcement presence surrounding the area. The fence that has separated protesters and U.S. agents stationed at the courthouse was decorated with balloons and upside down American flags sewn together with “BLM” painted across, an apparent reference to the Black Lives Matter movement. At one point in the night a small firework was shot over the fence. As it sizzled out on its own, protesters pleaded with others to remain peaceful. Later, a few small fires were occasionally started outside the courthouse, with at least one put out by other protesters. Unlike previous weeks, protesters were not centered mainly outside the courthouse, but scattered throughout downtown. Trump, who has largely hitched his political fate to his image as the “law and order president”, downplayed the withdrawal in a tweet on Friday night, insisting the Department of Homeland Security “is not leaving Portland until local police complete cleanup of Anarchists and Agitators!” Protests have roiled Portland for more than two months following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Florida reported more than 9,000 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, and hospitals in the state are making preparations as Hurricane Isaias beats down on the US coast. Cape Canaveral Hospital, which is located on a barrier island, said it had made plans before the storm hits and had moved its Covid-19 patients to other facilities before the storm hits. “[S]hould there have been an evacuation, we wanted to make sure we took every necessary precaution,” a statement from the hospital said. “As we have prepared for the storm, we have contingency plans in place to care for all of our patients during this public health crisis, keeping them as safe as possible from not only the virus but the storm.” Meanwhile, the storm is passing over the Bahamas and the winds are picking up: Our senior political reporter Daniel Strauss has news on why a Silicon Valley billionaire trying to get an immigration hawk elected to the US Senate: In usually deep-red Kansas, Democrats have the luxury of a sleepy primary contest for US Senate. Republicans do not. That’s because in the Democratic primary the Kansas state senator Barbara Bollier is the heavy favorite to win her party’s nomination and then run a competitive general election campaign fueled by a large war chest of cash. That prospect is sharpened because Republicans are having to go through a bloody primary between the Kansas congressman Roger Marshall and former Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach, the immigration hardliner and former Republican nominee for governor whose unpopularity – should he win the nod – could hand the Democrats a vital Senate seat they would never normally hope to win. Kobach’s candidacy is notable for its support from the billionaire Peter Thiel, the libertarian venture capitalist who has at times expressed the same type of hardline immigration stances as Kobach.

On Saturday, Andrew Cuomo said 34 establishments in the city were given Covid-19 related violations on Friday night, and seven had their liquor licenses revoked. “We need the NYPD to step up and do enforcement,” Cuomo said. There were four reported deaths from Covid-19 in New York state on Friday. More than 82,000 tests were conducted and 753 of those came back positive for the virus. Lt Col Alexander Vindman, the 21-year US army veteran who reported concerns about Donald Trump’s 2019 phone call to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to fellow members of the National Security Council, has written an op-ed in the Washington Post condemning Donald Trump. Vindman went on to become a key figure in the president’s impeachment inquiry. Vindman, whose family fled from the Soviet Union when he was a child said he was alarmed by Trump’s rise and tactics. He described Trump’s administration as “reminiscent of the authoritarian regime my family fled,” adding that: “At no point in my career or life have I felt our nation’s values under greater threat and in more peril than at this moment.” He did however, say that he still has faith in American institutions: “During my testimony in the House impeachment inquiry, I reassured my father, who experienced Soviet authoritarianism firsthand, saying, ‘Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth.’ Despite Trump’s retaliation, I stand by that conviction,” he wrote. Vindman is retiring from the army and said he would now spend his time looking to “issue a mandate to reject hate and bigotry and a return to the ideals that set the United States apart from the rest of the world.” • This entry was amended on 2 August 2020 because Vindman’s family fled from the Soviet Union, not to the Soviet Union as an earlier version said. Donald Trump has approved a declaration of emergency in Florida as Hurricane Isaias approaches. Officials in Miami have already closed beaches, marinas and parks in the city to prepare for the storm, which has emerged from the Bahamas. “The President’s action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate all disaster relief efforts which have the purpose of alleviating the hardship and suffering caused by the emergency on the local population,” the White House said in a press release. Florida’s Division of Emergency Management is also sending 10,000 items of personal protective equipment to shelters as the potential for people crowding together as the storm peaks grows. Miami hospitals, already stretched by the Covid-19 pandemic, say they have four days of emergency power should the grid go down. ESPN reported on Friday night that Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred fears the season may be in jeopardy if baseball and, by extension, Manfred himself, does not do a better job of containing Covid-19. A host of games have been wiped out in a season that has already been shortened and intensified by the pandemic. An outbreak in the Miami Marlins camp led to the postponement of their games as well as ones involving the Yankees, Phillies and Nationals. With few spare dates in the shortened calendar to make up the missed games, the future does not look bright. Now news is emerging of an outbreak among the St Louis Cardinals. Their game against the Brewers was called off on Friday night after a number of positive tests, and ESPN reports Saturday’s game has been postponed after four more positive tests in the team. MLB has chosen not to play its season in an “isolated bubble” as other leagues, such as MLS and the NBA have done. Those leagues are playing at Disney World in Florida, meaning teams do not have to travel as much as their counterparts in baseball do. Amid all the noise of an election involving Donald Trump – all the inflammatory tweets and shadowy Facebook posts – one set of ads has somehow managed to break through. There’s the one of the US president shuffling down a ramp that declares that the president “is not well”. There’s the whispering one about Trump’s “loyalty problem” inside his White House, campaign and family. There’s the epic Mourning in America that remakes Reagan’s election-defining 1984 ad, turning the sun-bathed suburbs into a dark national portrait of pandemic and recession. On Twitter, YouTube and Facebook, those three ads alone have racked up more than 35m views. The Lincoln Project, run by a group of renegade Republican political consultants, has crystallized one of the core narratives of the 2020 campaign in ways that few other political commercials have in past cycles. Its work on brutal attack ads sits alongside the swift boat veterans against John Kerry in 2004, the Willie Horton ad against Michael Dukakis in 1988, and the daisy ad against Barry Goldwater in 1964. Their reward? Disdain from independent media, distrust across the political spectrum and a recent series of harshly negative coverage from pro-Trump media outlets. You can read the full article below: Coronavirus cases remain high in Florida, one of the US hotspots for the virus. On Saturday, the state’s health department reported 9,591 new cases of the disease and 179 new deaths. It is the fifth day in a row the state has reported more than 9,000 new cases, although it is down from the recent period when more than 10,000 new daily cases were regularly reported. Florida’s Agency for Health Care Administration says 7,942 people are currently in hospital with the virus, down from the just over 8,000 people last weekend. Florida’s department of health says 7,022 people have now died from Covid-19 in the state. A record-setting quarterly fall in US economic growth was announced earlier this week. The news came as another 1.43 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits. Meanwhile, Democrats and Republicans are far from reaching agreement about how to implement support for the unemployed. An extra $600 in benefits a week was initially given to the unemployed during the pandemic but that aid officially expired on Friday night. Around 20 million people qualified for the payments and they accounted for 15% of the nation’s wages. House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer met with White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin on Saturday in Pelosi’s office to discuss the next stage in benefits. Pelosi said she hopes “that we make progress on a long-term deal”, while Mnuchin told reporters: “We’re just hopeful that they’re willing really to negotiate today, if they are, we’re prepared to make a deal on behalf of the American people.” Democrats want the $600 payments to continue until January, while Republicans want to cut the installments to $200 until states set up a system that sees the unemployed get 70% of their wages before they were laid off. The two parties are still far apart. Democrats see the $600 payments as vital for keeping families and individuals fed and housed during the pandemic, while Republicans believe they discourage people from seeking work. On Friday, Meadows said Democrats are “playing politics at a critical time”, while Pelosi countered that Republicans are “disrespectful of the needs of America’s working families.” Erum Salam in Houston has news of the surge in Covid-19 cases in Texas: An older man in an orange apron greets customers at the Home Depot in College Station, Texas. Signs serving as a reminder they are living through a pandemic are plastered on the sliding glass doors: “Face covering required.” The reminder is much needed because to an outsider, Texas looked almost the same in July 2019 as it does in July 2020, despite Covid-19 having claimed more than 6,000 lives in the state and more than 150,000 lives in the US since March. Customers at the home improvement store walk in wearing masks, which have become highly politicized, only to lower them below their chins to speak or remove them altogether. In the upscale neighborhood of Montrose in Houston, the multi-story Agora coffee house is full of people hungry for coffee, pastries and conversation. It’s difficult to spot an open seat inside or outside on the patio. It’s also difficult to spot anyone wearing anything resembling a face covering. The Texas governor, Greg Abbott, a Republican, caught flak for allowing the reopening of bars, restaurants, movie theaters and shopping malls back in early May. In June, he said that Texas was “wide open for business”. Now in late July, more than four months into the Covid-19 pandemic, a mandatory mask order is in place across the state – a reversal from Abbott’s initial position that the government should not infringe on personal rights by telling citizens what to do. But, with little enforcement except by some businesses, some worry Abbott’s reversals are too little, too late. As hospitals struggle and cases mount, much of ordinary life in Texas still appears to continue as normal. You can read the full story below: Donald Trump has arrived at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia. It’s the 12th day he has spent golfing out of the last 36. His motorcade was booed by a group of dogwalkers, while another person held a sign up reading “We are good trouble”, a reference to congressman and civil rights activist John Lewis who died last month. A man in a “Make America Great Again” cap saluted the motorcade as it passed. The president fired off a few tweets last night, repeating his familiar line that Covid-19 cases in the US are surging due to increased testing (which doesn’t explain the sharp rise in deaths). He also turned his attention to a familiar enemy: protesters in Portland. “Homeland Security is not leaving Portland until local police complete cleanup of Anarchists and Agitators!” he tweeted on Friday night. And no sooner has Karen Bass emerged as a frontrunner for Biden’s vice-presidential pick than stories, probably not discouraged by her rivals, bubble to the surface. Rightwing website the Daily Caller reports that Bass praised Scientology for its “commitment…to make a difference” during the opening of a Scientology building in California in 2010. During the ceremony Bass also praised Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard for his belief that “all people of whatever race, color or creed, are created with equal rights”. Scientology has come under intense scrutiny after claims of physical, psychological and sexual abuse against its followers, accusations detailed in documentaries such as Going Clear by Alex Gibney, which focused on former members of the church. The Church of Scientology denies the allegations of abuse and mistreatment among its ranks. Good morning. As November’s election approaches speculation over who Joe Biden will pick as his running mate mounts. The presumptive Democratic candidate for president has promised he will pick a woman as his running mate and his list of candidates is beginning to narrow. CNN reports that 11 candidates are in the running. Kamala Harris remains the oddsmakers’ favourite, and Biden was seen holding a list with her name and handwritten notes about the California senator on it. However, in recent days, Karen Bass, congresswoman and chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, has emerged as a frontrunner, and Politico reports that members of Harris’s team requested a meeting with Biden after learning their candidate was not a shoo-in for the VP slot. Harris is reported to have suffered after not showing contrition for remarks she made last year that appeared to depict Biden as racially insensitive. Biden was supposed to name his running mate next week, but Politico reports the selection is now more likely to be announced in mid-August. Other names in the running who have been vetted by Biden’s team include Senators Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Duckworth; Florida congresswoman Val Demings; Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms; and governors Gretchen Whitmer and Michelle Lujan Grisham. Ed Rendell, the former governor of Pennsylvania and a Biden supporter, told CNN that Bass is seen as a safer choice than Harris. “Kamala can rub some people the wrong way. Karen Bass is not likely to do that,” Rendell said. “The number one rule for picking the VP? Do no harm.” One outside candidate gaining some momentum is Susan Rice, Barack Obama’s former national security adviser. Although she lacks the campaigning experience of Bass and Harris, she worked with Biden during his own time as vice-president and has vast experience in global relations, which could prove invaluable during a time of turmoil around the world. “If there ever was a time to pick someone without campaign experience, this would be the year,” a former member of Obama’s administration who has worked closely with Rice told CNN. “Susan would be the best governing partner.”
30	Mikel Arteta believes Arsenal’s FA Cup triumph can persuade Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to sign a new contract at the north London club. The striker’s two goals against Chelsea can only have enhanced the number of rivals casting covetous eyes in his direction, but Arteta wants to remodel his side around Aubemeyang and is determined to keep a player with one year remaining on his current deal. “He knows what I think about him, I want to build a squad around him,” said Arsenal’s manager. “I want him to stay, it’s about getting the deal done.” Despite negotiations proving inconclusive, Arteta remains confident Arsenal have shown their star striker sufficient love to ensure he sticks around. “I think moments like this will help him to believe we are on the right path and he is a big part of it. He is loved by everyone at the club. I think he will [stay].” Aubameyang, though, was giving little away. When asked if he would be signing a new contract, the forward said there was “nothing” he could reveal. “Just the trophy, that is it,” he said before, to the amusement of his teammates, proceeding to drop the Cup. “He needs more experience with trophies,” joked Arteta who praised his players’ resilience in fighting back after falling behind. “I knew the challenge when I took the decision to come here. We had to change the mentality. But now this team have made me proud and after we can win titles together.” Arteta replied “I think so” to an inquiry about whether this was the greatest moment of his career. “I’m so proud to represent these players and this club. “It was a difficult start when we conceded so early, but if I know something about these players it’s that we weren’t going to give up. They reacted straight away. We played probably the best 30 minutes after since I arrived and from the equaliser, we went on and generated belief.” “They have worked hard. It’s a double reward for us, it is really important in every way for this club to be in Europe.” Arsenal’s manager made a point of thanking his mentor. “I have to say a very big thank you to Pep, his teachings are a big reason I’m a manager,” he said. While Arteta was wreathed in smiles, Frank Lampard opened the post-match media debrief with a face like thunder before gradually recovering a little of his more customary good humour. “It [Mateo Kovacic’s second yellow card] wasn’t a sending off but we didn’t play well enough to win a final,” said Chelsea’s manager, as he refused to use his team’s injuries and reduction to 10 men as excuses. “We had control of the game but then we got sloppy. We were slow, we invited pressure. But Willian got injured in the last 24 hours and had to pull out. And then to have two hamstring injuries [César Azpilicueta and Christian Pulisic] and a dislocated shoulder [Pedro] felt like it came a bit to the tipping point today. “We are at the end of a long, long season. We shouldn’t become too stuck on today. It would have been nice, the icing on the cake but it wasn’t to be.”
31	Here’s a rundown of Saturday’s events. We’ll be back tomorrow for all Sunday’s news. Calls for nationwide sickout as Arizona school district cancels reopening. Arizona public school district forced to abandon plans after more than 100 teachers and staff members called in sick Pelosi vows to protect USPS and accuses Trump of ‘openly working to destroy’ it. House speaker said president is actively trying to ‘sabotage’ agency’s ability to deliver mail-in ballots in time for election Trump says he will ‘take a look’ at pardon for Edward Snowden. President said at press conference he did not know much about whistleblower’s case Fights break out during protest near Confederate memorial in Georgia. Several dozen rightwing demonstrators, many wearing military gear, faced off against counter-protesters in Stone Mountain Iran calls US defeat over UN arms embargo a ‘humiliation’. Hassan Rouhani triumphant after only two countries vote in favour of prolonging embargo The state of the US Postal Service, and its relationship to November’s election, came up again in today’s briefing. Here’s my colleague Sam Levin on the ins and outs of the topic: Trump wraps up his briefing with a number of pats on the back for himself about the great job he thinks he is doing. Trump is asked about a Newsweek article that called into question, falsely, Kamala Harris’s citizenship. The article was reminiscent of the “birther” conspiracy theories around Barack Obama when he ran for president, and Trump helped circulate. Trump calls the article’s author a “brilliant lawyer” but says“I know nothing about [the article]”. He adds that Harris’s citizenship is not “something that bothers me” and he wont pursue the matter. Harris is a US citizen and was born in Oakland, California. Trump says “we’ve done it right” when it comes to Covid-19. He says the US, which has the most deaths in the world from Covid-19, is doing “very well” on Covid-19. Trump is asked if the postmaster general is purposely cutting postal services to hurt mail-in voting. Trump says DeJoy is “trying to streamline the postal service and make it great again”. Again, Trump has admitted admitted last week that he opposed aid for the USPS because he believed extra money would help the delivery of mail-in ballots. Trump is asked about allegations the US postmaster general, a Trump supporter, is damaging the US Postal Service in order to hurt mail-in voting, something Trump opposes. He says Louis DeJoy is a “brilliant businessperson” and blames Democrats for failure to get funding sorted for the USPS. Trump admitted last week that he opposed Democrats’ demand for $25bn in government aid to the USPS because he believed it would support the delivery of mail-in ballots. To reporters’ questions. Trump is asked about the US’s failure to get an embargo against Iran for arms extended. “We’ll be doing a snapback of sanctions” against Iran, says Trump. It’s not exactly clear what the point of this briefing is, apart from for Trump to tell America how great a job he thinks he is doing, while he trails Joe Biden in the polls. Talking of Biden, he says China “will own the United States” if Biden becomes president. He then says he wants college football to come back after several large conferences cancelled their seasons due to Covid-19. He then gives an in-depth analysis of the Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence. It’s true that Trevor Lawrence is very good at football, but quite how Trump’s scouting report helps the thousands of people who have had their lives devastated by Covid-19 is beyond me. He then takes a shot at the NBA, which has allowed players to kneel during the anthem. He then returns to Lawrence, who he reminds us is good at football (FACT CHECK: Lawrence is indeed good at football). Trump is early to the podium, which must be a first. He says there has been a “steep decline” in Covid-19 cases across the US over the last week. The man who once suggested injecting disinfectant could be a good cure for Covid-19 then says Americans should use “common sense” treatments for the virus. He insists on calling the Covid-19 the “China virus” as is his tiresome and racist custom. He also says that the US economy is experiencing the “fastest” recovery in history. He says retail spending is at an “all-time”. Economists have said that the US economy is far from back to normal and won’t be for some time. “Jobs for more-skilled workers in business/professional services are making little headway overall and are declining in computer services, management and advertising,” Sophia Koropeckyj, economist at Moody’s Analytics, wrote in an investor note earlier this week. “These are the secondary effects of the stressed economy.”’ There was relatively good news on the jobs front. The latest figures from the US labor department showed 963,000 people filing claims after 20 weeks of claims above 1m. Claims still remain historically high. Before the pandemic, claims were averaging about 200,000 a week and the previous record for claims was 695,000, set in 1982. Republican senator Lindsey Graham said the United Nations security council made a “major mistake” when it rejected a US request to extend an arms embargo against Iran on Friday. Only two countries - the US and the Dominican Republic - voted for the motion, while 11 abstained and two voted against. “The United Nations Security Council overwhelmingly rejected an extension of the Iranian arms embargo. This was a major mistake by the UN. It also makes a major conflict with Iran much more likely as they build up their military arsenal,” tweeted Graham on Saturday. Among those who abstained were traditional allies of the US such as the UK and France. Iran’s president said the result was a humiliation for the US. “I don’t remember the US preparing a resolution for months to strike a blow at the Islamic Republic of Iran, and it garners only one vote,” Hassan Rouhani said in a televised speech. “But the great success was that the US was defeated in this conspiracy with humiliation.” Donald Trump’s scheduled 5pm press conference from his Bedminster golf club has been moved to 5.30pm (or in roughly 20 minutes), per the man himself. It’s unclear whether it’s related to the delay, but the Secret Service tells NBC News it is investigating a small plane that violated the restricted airspace around Trump National. The plane landed as directed after US military aircraft were launched when it didn’t respond to radio. Nine University of Oklahoma football players tested positive for coronavirus after returning from a break in preseason camp. Head coach Lincoln Riley said he was “disappointed” by the news in a Zoom call with media on Saturday. “We did conduct a Covid test as planned with our players last night, got the results this morning we had nine players tested positive for Covid. We had a couple of other that have been isolated due to contract tracing,” Riley said. “Disappointed by the news. We’ve done such a tremendous job this entire time. You know when (you) give players time, there is risk in that. This isn’t the NBA, we don’t have a bubble. We all have to continue to work to do a better job by all accounts. We’re still confident in the plan that we have.” The entire program had returned only one positive result since the start of workouts on 1 July until Riley announced the one-week break on 8 August. The coach gave players the option of returning home, though most stayed on campus. An Oklahoma source told the Athletic that “the majority of those who tested positive were players that remained in the local area/community”. The Sooners are part of the Big 12, which is one of three major conferences that said this week they intend to move forward with fall football seasons. The Food and Drug Administration on Saturday granted emergency use authorization to Yale School of Public Health’s saliva test to detect Covid-19, after a trial on National Basketball Association players and staff. SalivaDirect, the fifth saliva test approved by the FDA for the disease, requires no swab or collection device and uses spit from people suspected of having the coronavirus, the agency said. FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn called the test “groundbreaking” in its efficiency and in being unaffected by crucial component shortages. SalivaDirect is seen as a cheap, simpler and less invasive testing method that requires no extraction of nucleic acid and can use several readily available reagents. The NBA has used the test in a program involving asymptomatic players, coaches and staff from various teams, after partnering with Yale in June, the school said in a separate statement. “We simplified the test so that it only costs a couple of dollars for reagents, and we expect that labs will only charge about $10 per sample,” Nathan Grubaugh, assistant professor at Yale School of Public Health said. The FDA said the test could lower the risk to healthcare workers from collecting samples as it is self-collected under the observation of a healthcare professional. The number of known coronavirus tests administered daily in the United States has fallen for the first time in an alarming trend that threatens to undermine the nation’s efforts to contain the pandemic. An estimated 733,000 people have been tested each day this month on average, down from nearly 750,000 in July, according to the independent Covid Tracking Project. “We’re clearly not doing enough,” said Dr Mark McClellan, the director of the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy and the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration under former US president George W Bush, told the New York Times. Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed the United States is the “envy of the world” when it comes to testing, which public health experts have described as an essential measure toward reining in the coronavirus in absence of a vaccine. A former Minneapolis police officer involved in the arrest of George Floyd admitted he could have been “more observant” as he worked crowd control during the nearly eight minutes his partner held his knee against Floyd’s neck. Tou Thao, one of four former officers charged in Floyd’s death, described himself as a “human traffic cone” in a newly released video interview with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension conducted eight days following the 25 May incident. The AP reports: “I don’t want anyone to die,” Thao told an investigator who asked what his reaction was to Floyd’s death. “It was kind of a somber moment, especially for me. My heart kind of sank.” Thao voluntarily participated in the 1hr 40min interview with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension eight days after Floyd’s death. He said that as the bystanders got louder, he became worried they might rush Chauvin and two other officers who were holding Floyd on the ground. Thao and Chauvin had responded to the scene to help two officers, Thomas Lane and J Kueng, who were attempting to arrest Floyd for allegedly passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a convenience store. While they were on the way, Thao said that dispatch canceled the backup call. But Thao, who was driving, said he felt compelled to respond because Lane and Kueng were new officers and the intersection was known to be “especially hostile” to police. Thao said Floyd appeared to be on drugs, resisted arrested and used his legs get out of a squad car. As the officers restrained Floyd on the ground, Thao said he heard Floyd say he couldn’t breathe, adding, “but then he was obviously yelling and talking”. Thao also said he has never used the maneuver that Chauvin used to pin Floyd to the ground. Although a woman who identified herself as a Minneapolis firefighter approached Thao and demanded that officers check Floyd’s pulse, Thao told investigators that his job was securing the scene and that he couldn’t “be in two places at once”. Thao, Lane and Kueng are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. All four officers were fired and are scheduled for trial in March. The St Louis Cardinals returned to action for the first time in 17 days on Saturday after their season was derailed by a coronavirus outbreak. The reigning NL Central champions have played just five games since Major League Baseball started its shortened 60-game season last month. Star catcher Yadier Molina and infielder Paul DeJong were among 10 players and 18 members of the Cardinals organization overall with confirmed coronavirus cases. The team traveled to Chicago in 41 rental cars ahead of today’s game against the White Sox as an added precaution. “Today feels very much like opening day for the St Louis Cardinals, and there’s a lot of excitement right now in that clubhouse,” said John Mozeliak, the team’s president of baseball operations. The pandemic forced MLB to delay and truncate the familiar 162-game, six-month season to a 60-game, 67-day sprint with a number of rule changes designed to speed up the game and protect the players and umpires. Anyone can get a coronavirus test at the CentroMed clinic in San Antonio, but on a recent day, the drive-thru was empty, the Associated Press reports. With hundreds of deaths reported each day, students returning to class, and football teams charging ahead with plans to play, Texas’s leaders who have grappled with testing shortages for much of the pandemic are now facing the opposite problem: not enough takers. “We’re not having enough people step forward,” Republican governor Greg Abbott said. The number of coronavirus tests being done each day in Texas has dropped by the thousands in August, mirroring nationwide trends that have seen daily testing averages in the US fall nearly 9% since the end of July, according to the Covid Tracking Project. The dropoff comes as the US has surpassed 5 million confirmed coronavirus cases and is closing in on 170,000 deaths. It threatens to put the US even further behind other countries that have better managed the pandemic, in part through more aggressive testing. The trend worries health experts: Texas embarked on one of the fastest reopenings in the country in May, but retreated weeks later in the face of massive outbreaks, ultimately leading Abbott to impose a statewide mask order after previously saying he wouldn’t. At one point, one overwhelmed hospital on the Texas border was airlifting Covid-19 patients hundreds of miles north in search of open beds, and Houston this month began threatening $250 (£190) fines for not wearing face coverings in an effort to drive down infection numbers. In recent weeks, things have improved, including a nearly 40% drop in hospitalisations since July’s peak. But deaths remain high, and doctors in some parts say they’re still stretched. Texas has been averaging more than 210 reported new deaths a day over the past two weeks, according to the Covid Tracking Project. On Friday, it reported 313 deaths. Overall, the state has recorded more than 9,600 fatalities. The rolling average of people who test positive for the virus in Texas is stubbornly elevated at 16%, a figure that itself could be a sign of insufficient testing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said a positivity rate under 10% is an indicator that a state has robust testing. Abbott has said that unless Texas gets below that number, bars are likely to stay shut. Other states in the South clobbered by the virus this summer are also seeing improvements, including Alabama. Intensive care units remain frustratingly full there, but the average number of new confirmed cases each day has dropped below 1,000, from 1,800 in mid-July. It was a warning that America chose to ignore, but a moment remembered long after the speeches of career politicians were done and forgotten. Four summers ago, in the lead-up to the pivotal 2016 US election, Khizr Khan stood before the Democratic national convention in Philadelphia and told how his son, an American Muslim and army captain, died in Iraq. He had a question for Donald Trump, the Republican nominee threatening to ban Muslim immigrants. “Have you even read the United States constitution?” he demanded, holding a copy aloft, as he delivered a seven-minute tour de force that became the emotional heart of one of the biggest weeks of the election campaign. When Democrats convene for their 2020 convention next week, albeit virtually, Khan will again be taking part. His darkest fears about Trump and the mortal threat he poses to the constitution have been realised, he says. But he retains faith in America and finds hope in Joe Biden, the Democratic presumptive nominee, who understands what it is to endure the death of a child. “Losing a family member creates a hole in the parents’ and family’s hearts which never fills,” the 70-year-old lawyer told the Guardian in a phone interview from his home in Charlottesville, Virginia, as he recalled he and his wife, Ghazala, meeting the former vice-president. “We could see that he could feel the hole in our heart and we could feel the hole in his heart, and that connection has been everlasting. “The president of the United States is a father figure, a figure that must be compassionate to the suffering and pains of the nation. Joe Biden has that element. He has that character. To our disappointment, the current president does not. We had hoped that Trump would find somewhere along the way that element of character. Alas, that never happened, but Joe Biden has that element.” You can read the full article below: Illinois governor JB Pritzker has paid tribute to Jim Thompson, who served as the state’s governor from 1977 to 1991, and has died aged 84. “On behalf of the entire state of Illinois, [my wife] MK and I offer our deepest condolences to the family and friends of former Governor Jim Thompson,” he said in a statement posted to Twitter. “As the longest-serving governor in Illinois history, ‘Big Jim’ was known to treat people he encountered with kindness and decency. He dedicated himself to building positive change for Illinois, and he set an example for public service of which Illinoisans should be proud. He will be remembered and revered as one of the titans in the history of state government.” Thompson is survived by his wife Jayne and daughter Samantha. “The Thompson family is mourning the loss of a wonderful husband, father and grandfather,” they wrote on a statement. “Jim Thompson’s love and devotion to his family mirrored his lifelong dedication to his beloved State of Illinois. His guiding principle in public and private life was to help people and do what he could so they could have an opportunity to succeed. In that process, he achieved big things for Illinois that matched the life he lived.” As well as the US Postal Service, the climate and voting rights, it appears Donald Trump is dangerous to users of recreational drugs. The Press Association has more: UK police have issued a warning about a dangerous high-strength batch of Donald Trump-shaped ecstasy pills. A man in his 30s from Luton has been arrested on suspicion of supplying the orange tablets, which bear the likeness of the US president, said Bedfordshire police. DS Ryan Barnes said: “Criminals are constantly finding new ways to sell their drugs and make them more appealing. “We have seen MDMA tablets created to look like a number of culturally popular items before and a recent example of this is the ‘Donald Trumps’. “The Donald Trumps are dangerous tablets that contain extremely high levels of MDMA and could put anyone taking these in serious harm. “If you come across these or any other type of drug, please do not take them for your own safety, as you can never be sure what these pills contain.” Protesters have staged a demonstration outside the Washington DC home of postmaster general Louis DeJoy. DeJoy is a major Trump donor and has come under heavy criticism for his handling of the US Postal Service, which could in turn affect November’s elections. Here’s my colleague Sam Levine on why anger is being directed at DeJoy: In July, the Washington Post and other news organizations reported the agency was banning overtime and instructing postal workers to leave the mail behind if it delayed them on their routes. There are also reports of the USPS removing mail sorting machines from facilities, which could lead to a further slowdown. Critics suggest Trump and DeJoy are deliberately slowing the mail to make it more difficult to vote by mail. DeJoy has strongly denied any political interference. But on Thursday, Trump openly admitted he was blocking $25bn in proposed aid to the post office because he wanted to make it harder to vote by mail. You can read more of Sam’s look at the problems at the USPS here: While sports leagues, such as the NBA, playing in “bubbles” have managed to escape large scale disruption from Covid-19, Major League Baseball is still encountering problems. MLB is playing a reduced schedule of games, but teams are still traveling between cities to face each other. The Miami Marlins and St Louis Cardinals have both had to call off a significant number of games after outbreaks among their staff, and now the Cincinnati Reds and Pittsburgh Pirates have postponed their games against each other this weekend after a Reds player tested positive for the virus. The Hill reports that Bill Mitchell, a pro-Trump pundit has been permanently suspended from Twitter. “[Mitchell] has been permanently suspended for violating the Twitter Rules by using one account to evade the suspension of another account,” a Twitter spokesperson told the Hill in an email. Mitchell is the host of YouTube show YourVoice America and is a purveyor of QAnon conspiracy theories. He is also an ardent supporter of the president, and was followed on Twitter by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr before his suspension. Mitchell said on social media channel Parler that he had been suspended for his views on Covid-19. “Twitter just suspended me for opposing masks. Who knows if I’ll ever be back,” Mitchell said. “I’m sure their decision wasn’t political at all.” New York reports that there are 523 people in hospital in the state due to Covid-19, which NY governor Andrew Cuomo says is the lowest number since 17 March. Of the 88,668 tests in New York on Friday, 734 were positive. Five people died from the virus in New York on Friday. Cuomo said on Friday that bowling alleys across the state can reopen with 50% capacity, while a protocol will be announced on Monday for gyms. My colleagues Kari Paul and Ed Pilkington have had an in-depth look at the rise of Kamala Harris, and what the future may hold for Joe Biden’s running mate: Bancroft Way in Berkeley, California, is quaint and slow, the kind of street where everyone seems to know each other by name. This week, neighbors sat outdoors drinking wine under the evening sun, as they chatted animatedly about their childhood companion who had just become headline news. It was on Bancroft Way that Kamala Harris spent her formative years with her single mother, Shyamala, and sister, Maya. Today, former neighbors reminisce about her following her selection this week as Joe Biden’s Democratic running mate in his bid to evict Donald Trump from the White House. “I am really proud of her and think she will make a very good vice-president,” Kenneth Hunter said. He was standing at the same street corner where he said he and Harris had caught the bus every morning for Thousand Oaks elementary school in north Berkeley as part of efforts to desegregate local schools. But even here, among her childhood friends, and just days away from the Democratic national convention, where Harris will enter the history books as the first woman of color to be placed on a major-party presidential ticket, there’s a note of hesitancy. Octavia, a third-generation Berkeley resident who lives on the block, said she was worried that criticism of Harris’s record as a former prosecutor might dampen enthusiasm among Black voters, who make up a crucial share of the Democratic party’s support. “Not enough Black people are behind her,” said Octavia, requesting not to give her last name. “When people say they don’t want to vote for her, I ask: ‘How many Black or brown women who look like you and me are there in office right now? How could you not vote for her?’” That’s a debate that is likely to rumble on not just in Berkeley and neighboring Oakland, where Harris was born in 1964, but throughout California and across the nation ahead of the US presidential election on 3 November. Just who is Kamala Harris, and what does she represent for future of the Democratic party and, potentially, of the most powerful country on Earth? You can read the full article below: Although Covid-19 cases in Florida are no longer topping 10,000 a day, the virus is still taking its toll on the state. The Florida department of health reported 204 new deaths from the virus on Saturday, bringing the state’s total to 9,345 since the start of the pandemic. The department reported 6,352 new cases on Saturday, the 53rd consecutive day the state has recorded more than 4,000 new cases, according to CNN. Meanwhile, health experts are warning that flu and Covid-19 represent a “double barrel” threat to Americans this winter. Newsweek has apologised for an op-ed it published on Kamala Harris that carried disturbing parallels to the “birther” conspiracy theories directed at Barack Obama during his run for the presidency. In the column, Chapman University law professor John Eastman suggested that Harris, who was born in Oakland, may have questionable citizenship as both her parents were immigrants. “Before we so cavalierly accept Senator Harris’ eligibility for the office of vice president, we should ask her a few questions about the status of her parents at the time of her birth,” he wrote. Donald Trump was asked about the article and said he had “no idea if that’s right.” He also said that “the lawyer that wrote that piece is a very highly qualified, talented lawyer”. Newsweek resisted calls to take the article down, saying they had decided to leave the article up with a clarification in the interests of “transparency”. “This op-ed is being used by some as a tool to perpetuate racism and xenophobia. We apologize,” read a note at the end of the article. “The essay, by John Eastman, was intended to explore a minority legal argument about the definition of who is a natural-born citizen in the United States. But to many readers, the essay inevitably conveyed the ugly message that Senator Kamala Harris, a woman of color and the child of immigrants, was somehow not truly American. “The op-ed was never intended to spark or to take part in the racist lie of Birtherism, the conspiracy theory aimed at delegitimizing Barack Obama, but we should have recognized the potential, even probability, that that could happen. All of us at Newsweek are horrified that this op-ed gave rise to a wave of vile Birtherism directed at Senator Harris.” Eastman ran unsuccessfully in the 2010 Republican primary as a candidate for California attorney general. Harris eventually won the election against Republican Steve Cooley. Some important UFO (or technically UAP) news: The US department of Defense has formed a new body to investigate what it calls “unidentified aerial phenomena” (UAPs) following reported sightings of what most people call UFOs. The move is likely to spark wide interest in alien hunters worldwide looking for signs that humanity is not alone in the universe. Although the dry language of the Pentagon’s announcement of the new group belied its intent as watchers of the sky for potential first contact. The Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF) was created by the deputy defense secretary, David Norquist, on 4 August, strengthening an already existing effort that since 2018 has been under the purview of the Office of Naval Intelligence. “The Department of Defense established the UAPTF to improve its understanding of, and gain insight into, the nature and origins of UAPs. The mission of the task force is to detect, analyze and catalog UAPs that could potentially pose a threat to US national security,” the Pentagon said in a statement. And while we’re on the subject, here’s a wonderful alien-themed story from our archive if you have time for a Saturday morning read: Republican senator, and regular Donald Trump critic, Mitt Romney has said he does not believe mail-in voting fraud is a problem, despite the president’s comments to the contrary. “I don’t know of any evidence that voting by mail would increase voter fraud,” Romney said during an interview with the Sutherland Institute on Friday. “My biggest concern, frankly, with regards to voting fraud has been that there would be some kind of hacking of our voting electronic systems, and that voting machines or tabulating equipment would be hacked.” Although he did not mention Trump specifically, Romney appeared to be referencing Trump’s attack on mail-in voting during another part of the interview. “When politicians attack a judicial system, attack a voting system ... attack a free press, these things threaten the foundation upon which not only our own democracy rests but democracies around the world rest,” he said. The Associated Press reports that a white state trooper has been charged with murder over the fatal shooting of a 60-year-old black man during a traffic stop: A Georgia state trooper was fired and charged with murder on Friday a week after he shot a 60-year-old man who tried to flee a rural traffic stop, authorities said. The president of Georgia’s NAACP chapter called the slaying of Julian Edward Roosevelt Lewis another chilling example of a Black man being killed unlawfully by a white law enforcement officer. An attorney for Lewis’ family said the trooper initiated the traffic stop over a burned-out tail light and Lewis was shot almost immediately after the trooper forced his car into a ditch. “Mr Lewis never got out of the vehicle and the investigation will show that, mere seconds after the crash, he was shot to death, shot in the face and killed,” attorney Francys Johnson said. Johnson said that information was given to the family by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which arrested 27-year-old Jacob Gordon Thompson on charges of felony murder and aggravated assault Friday. The agency did not include those details in its own statement on Thompson’s arrest. The GBI said Lewis was fatally shot on 7 August after a chase in rural Screven County, about 60 miles northwest of Savannah. Thompson had tried to pull over a car for a traffic violation when the driver tried to flee, the GBI said in a news release. The agency said the trooper chased the vehicle down several country roads before performing a maneuver that forced the car to come to a stop in a ditch. At some point afterward, Thompson fired a single gunshot that hit Lewis, killing him, the GBI said. The trooper was not injured. GBI spokeswoman Nelly Miles confirmed that Lewis was Black and the trooper was white, but she declined to comment further on the case. Richard Mallard, district attorney for the judicial circuit that includes Screven County, did not immediately return a phone message. House speaker Nancy Pelosi has written a letter to her Democrat colleagues in which she says Congress’s ongoing inability to agree on a stimulus bill during the Covid-19 pandemic is due to “the complete disarray on the Republican side — as President Trump contradicts his own negotiators and his own positions.” She also attacked Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell’s role in the stalled negotiations. “Senator McConnell’s attitude that states should go bankrupt is shared by the White House and has been a significant obstacle inside negotiations,” she wrote. Pelosi added that Donald Trump’s handling of the US Postal Service, and concerns over mail-in voting this November. “Before our eyes, President Trump is openly working to destroy the Post Office and sabotage its ability to deliver absentee ballots in time to be counted,” she wrote. “In the time of pandemic, the Postal System is Election Central. All patriots, Democrats, Independents or Republicans, should reject the President’s assault on the Postal System in this election season.” My colleague Sam Levine has taken a deeper look at why the United States Postal Service’s part in November’s election has come under scrutiny of late: An unprecedented number of Americans are expected to vote by mail this year because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Over the last few months, states across the US have seen record numbers of Americans request ballots and submit votes by mail in primary and other elections. Mail-in ballots may account for 50% of all of the votes cast this fall, according to an estimate by Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor who closely tracks voter turnout. That would be a huge increase from 2016 and 2018, when about a quarter of votes came through the mail. That surge means the USPS is going to play a much bigger role in facilitating an American presidential election than ever before. The agency will be responsible for transporting ballots between election officials and voters. Many states require ballots to arrive at election offices by the close of the polls on election day. Others allow ballot postmarked on or before election that arrive within a specified period. There’s concern over whether the USPS, which is already facing a severe financial crisis, will be able get ballots to voters and return them to election offices in time to have them counted. So what exactly is Trump doing to the USPS? Over the last few months there have been reports of severe mail delays across the US. In Philadelphia, for example, some residents told the Philadelphia Inquirer they had gone weeks without receiving mail. Concerns over those delays were heightened in early June when Louis DeJoy, a major Republican donor and Trump ally, took over as postmaster general, the top role at the USPS. In July, the Washington Post and other news organizations reported the agency was banning overtime and instructing postal workers to leave the mail behind if it delayed them on their routes. There are also reports of the USPS removing mail sorting machines from facilities, which could lead to a further slowdown. Critics suggest Trump and DeJoy are deliberately slowing the mail to make it more difficult to vote by mail. DeJoy has strongly denied any political interference. But on Thursday, Trump openly admitted he was blocking $25bn in proposed aid to the post office because he wanted to make it harder to vote by mail. You can read the full article below: Donald Trump has spent the early part of today retweeting stories that promote the (unproven) theory that mail-in voting is subject to widescale fraud. The president retweeted allegations of voting fraud in Paterson, New Jersey, along with the comment: “The Democrats know the 2020 Election will be a fraudulent mess. Will maybe never know who won!” Studies have concluded that cases of mail-in voting fraud are insignificant. The Washington Post found only 372 cases of double voting or voting on behalf of a dead person in its analysis of 14.6m votes cast in three states. A different study of voter fraud maintained by the conservative Heritage Foundation found 143 cases of criminal convictions involving absentee ballots over the last 20 years. That total is 0.00006% of the votes cast during that period. As for the Paterson case Trump is referring to, officials there told the Washington Post that they don’t believe the problems highlighted by the president and others there are symptomatic of widespread fraud in the area and that it was uncovered by election officials. However, there what cannot be denied is the fact that an underfunded USPS may struggle to cope with an increase in mail-in voting this November as Americans look to cast their ballots remotely due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Republicans have shown few signs of wanting to spend the estimated $4bn to pay for a competent mail-in service. Good morning. We start this morning with news that the United States Postal Service’s inspector general will investigate claims that recent changes could affect this November’s presidential election. Donald Trump has long issued baseless claims that mail-in voting is ripe for fraud and there are real concerns that cuts to the service could weaken the agency and mail-in ballots may not arrive on time to be counted. The problem is particularly relevant this year as the Covid-19 pandemic means many people will want to avoid voting in person at crowded polling stations. Earlier this week, the president admitted he is blocking $25bn in proposed aid to the USPS because he wants to make it harder to vote by mail.
32	This blog is now closed. Our coverage continues here. Here the latest updates at a glance: Britain’s health secretary Matt Hancock will announce this week that Public Health England (PHE) will be scrapped and replaced by a new body. The US Food and Drug Administration on Saturday granted emergency use authorisation for Yale School of Public Health’s saliva test to detect Covid-19, after a trial on National Basketball Association players and staff. Algeria started reopening its mosques, cafes, beaches and parks on Saturday for the first time in five months, gradually relaxing one of the world’s longer virus confinement periods. Greek authorities have announced 230 new coronavirus cases over the past day, 27 from international arrivals. South African president Cyril Ramaphosa said on Saturday that all indications were that South Africa had reached the peak of Covid-19 infections, as he announced a sweeping removal of lockdown restrictions on the economy. Students in Saudi Arabian public schools will be educated via distance learning for the first seven weeks of the new school year. Malta posted its highest ever daily-on-day rise in coronavirus infections. Turkey confirmed 1,256 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, the highest daily rise in infections since June. The French health ministry on Saturday reported 3,310 new coronavirus infections in France over the past 24 hours, setting a new post-lockdown high for the fourth day in a row and taking the country’s cumulative cases to 215,521. France is to propose that masks be worn in shared workspaces. Ireland reported a “deeply concerning” 200 new Covid-19 cases arising from multiple clusters across the country on Saturday, the highest daily amount since the beginning of May. The chairman of Ireland’s tourism authority has resigned after defying government guidance to avoid all non-essential travel by going on holiday to Italy. The United Kingdom has recorded 1,012 new coronavirus infections on Saturday, the fifth day in a row more than 1,000 infections have been reported in daily figures. That’s all from me from tonight, thanks so much for reading and writing in, as always. My colleagues in Australia will take over shortly. The annual light display honouring victims of the 9/11 terror attacks is back on, US officials announced on Saturday, saying New York health officials will supervise this year’s tribute to ensure workers’ safety amid concerns related to the coronavirus pandemic. “This year it is especially important that we all appreciate and commemorate 9/11, the lives lost and the heroism displayed as New Yorkers are once again called upon to face a common enemy,” governor Andrew Cuomo said in a statement. The announcement came days after the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum cancelled the Tribute in Light over concerns the coronavirus might spread among crews creating twin columns of light to represent the World Trade Center in the Manhattan sky. Alice Greenwald, president and CEO of the 9/11 Memorial &amp; Museum, thanked former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, Cuomo and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation for their assistance in offsetting the increased costs associated with the health and safety considerations around the tribute this year. “This year, its message of hope, endurance and resilience are more important than ever,” Greenwald said in a statement. The Tunnel to Towers Foundation recently decided to hold an alternative 9/11 Never Forget ceremony after the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum announced family members will not read the names of the nearly 3,000 victims this year, because of the pandemic. France is to propose that masks be worn in shared workspaces as the country grapples with a rebound in coronavirus cases that rose again in the past 24 hours to over 3,000. Employment minister Elisabeth Borne said she would propose on Tuesday at talks with employer and union representatives that masks be compulsory in collective workspaces. “A theme that appears in all scientific opinions is the value of wearing them [masks] when there are several people in a confined space,” Borne said in an interview with French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche. Doctors have increasingly called for masks to be required in the workplace while the HCSP, a body advising the government on health policy, issued a recommendation calling for masks to be compulsory in all common indoor spaces. Mexico added back 52,455 jobs in August, president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Saturday, hailing the news as a sign of recovery after the country lost more than 1 million jobs in the formal economy due to the coronavirus pandemic. “This is a good indicator ... We’re going to move ahead in spite of everything because we’re working in a professional manner,” he said in a video on Twitter, citing data from the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) on employees registered with the institute. IMSS said last week that 3,907 jobs were lost in July due to the pandemic, adding to 1.1 million jobs lost in the country between March and June, according to Reuters. Mexico ranks third worldwide for most coronavirus fatalities, with a death toll of 55,908, and its economy is expected to shrink this year by as much as 10% or more. Sir Keir Starmer has warned Boris Johnson it is his duty to ensure schools in England reopen in September as planned. Writing in the Mail on Sunday, the Labour leader said it was essential for the wellbeing and life chances of children that they were able to return to normal education next month. “So, let me send a very clear message to the prime minister: I don’t just want all children back at school next month, I expect them back at school. No ifs, no buts, no equivocation,” he said. “Let me be equally clear: It is the prime minister’s responsibility to guarantee children get the education they need and the benefit of being back with their teachers and classmates. “My offer to help the government reopen schools still stands, but responsibility for making it happen lies squarely at the door of Number 10.” Britain’s health secretary Matt Hancock will announce this week that Public Health England (PHE) will be scrapped and replaced by a new body specifically designed to protect England against a pandemic by early next month, the Sunday Telegraph newspaper reported. Hancock will announce a merger of the pandemic response work of PHE with NHS test and trace into a new body, called the National Institute for Health Protection, the newspaper said. The paper said the new body will become “effective” next month, although it will take until next spring to complete. The Conservative peer and former TalkTalk telecoms boss Baroness Harding, who currently heads Test and Trace, is being tipped to lead the organisation, the paper said. It quoted a senior minister as saying: “We want to bring together the science and the scale in one new body so we can do all we can to stop a second coronavirus spike this autumn.” The reported move follows repeated reports over recent months that ministers have been unhappy and frustrated with PHE’s response to the coronavirus crisis. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: “Public Health England have played an integral role in our national response to this unprecedented global pandemic. “We have always been clear that we must learn the right lessons from this crisis to ensure that we are in the strongest possible position, both as we continue to deal with Covid-19 and to respond to any future public health threat.” The Emirati APEX National Investment company signed a “strategic commercial agreement” with Israel’s Tera Group to cooperate on research and development related to Covid-19, including a testing device. The deal “is considered the first business to inaugurate trade, economy and effective partnerships between the Emirati and Israeli business sectors, for the benefit of serving humanity by strengthening research and studies on the Novel Coronavirus,” the UAE’s state news agency WAM said late on Saturday, quoting APEX’s chairman Khalifa Yousef Khoury. The agreement was signed at a press conference in Abu Dhabi, coming soon after Israel and the UAE announced an agreement on Thursday that will lead to a full normalisation of diplomatic relations between the two states. Mexico will need up to 200 million coronavirus vaccine doses, according to a senior government official. The immunisation of its 120 million inhabitants could start as early as April if clinical trials and regulatory approvals for pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca go as planned, Reuters reports. In partnership with the governments of Mexico and Argentina, AstraZeneca initially plans to produce 150 million doses in early 2021 and eventually make at least 400 million doses for distribution throughout Latin America. AstraZeneca is among those working on Covid-19 vaccine candidates around the world. Mexico’s government has also said it is considering other options for bringing a vaccine quickly to its population, the second-largest in Latin America. AstraZeneca will be able to produce between 30 and 35 million vaccines per month, Martha Delgado, a Mexican deputy foreign minister, told Reuters in an interview on Friday. The vaccine could require two doses to be effective, Delgado said. “If we need 200 million, we’re going to be vaccinating for a long time,” Delgado added. Last-stage so-called Phase III trials are expected to conclude by November or December, after which AstraZeneca will seek government approvals if the vaccine is found to be safe and effective. If that goes smoothly, Delgado estimated the first vaccines in Mexico could be administered in April. Mexico’s death toll of 55,908 stands as the world’s third highest behind the US and Brazil. Latin America’s 6 million cases and more than 237,000 deaths make it the world’s hardest-hit region. To ensure all Mexicans have access to a vaccine, the government of president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is in talks with other pharmaceutical laboratories in different stages of developing a vaccine. “Astra’s production isn’t going to be enough for Mexico. We need to supplement that with a couple of more vaccines,” Delgado said. Mexico’s government has completed memorandums of understanding with French drugmaker Sanofi, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Janssen unit, and Chinese companies CanSino Biologics Inc and Walvax Biotechnology Co Ltd. CanSino and Walvax are interested in producing a vaccine in Mexico for delivery to the Latin American market. The US Food and Drug Administration on Saturday granted emergency use authorisation for Yale School of Public Health’s saliva test to detect Covid-19, after a trial on National Basketball Association players and staff. SalivaDirect, the fifth saliva test approved by the FDA for the disease, requires no swab or collection device and uses spit from people suspected of having the coronavirus, the agency said. FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn called the test “groundbreaking” in its efficiency and in being unaffected by crucial component shortages. SalivaDirect is seen as a cheap, simpler and less invasive testing method that requires no extraction of nucleic acid and can use several readily available reagents. The NBA has used the test in a programme involving asymptomatic players, coaches and staff from various teams after partnering with Yale in June, the school said in a separate statement. “We simplified the test so that it only costs a couple of dollars for reagents, and we expect that labs will only charge about $10 per sample,” said Nathan Grubaugh, assistant professor at Yale School of Public Health. The FDA said the test could lower the risk to healthcare workers as the sample is self-collected, under the observation of a healthcare professional. Algeria started reopening its mosques, cafes, beaches and parks on Saturday for the first time in five months, gradually relaxing one of the world’s longer virus confinement periods. Curfews remain in place in more than half the country, and masks are required outdoors as Algeria tries to keep virus infections down, the Associated Press reports. But authorities decided to start reopening public places, saying the virus infection rate is believed to have stabilised. Crowds packed beaches on Saturday in the capital, Algiers, celebrating the opportunity to swim in the Mediterranean Sea during the August heat. Restaurants were also allowed to reopen, and mosques that can hold more than 1,000 people and ensure social distancing measures. However, mosques remain closed to all women, children and the elderly until further notice, and the main weekly prayers on Friday will remain banned to limit crowds. Mosque-goers must wear masks and bring their own prayer mats. This reopening will depend entirely on the discipline of each person to respect protection measures, said the minister for religious affairs, Mohamed Belmahdi, who was among those attending the first services on Saturday at Khaled Ibn El Walid mosque in the resort town of Heuraoua, east of Algiers. He warned that authorities would close mosques again if Algerians show even a slight indifference toward preventive measures. “The health of citizens comes before faith,” he said. Algeria has reported more than 37,000 virus infections and 1,350 deaths as of Friday, the third-highest death rate reported in Africa after South Africa and Egypt. Greek authorities have announced 230 new coronavirus cases over the past day, 27 from international arrivals, the daily I Kathimerini reported. There were also 3 new deaths. Total Covid-19 cases in Greece now stand at 6,858 with 226 deaths. There are 23 patients on ventilators, while 136 have recovered after having been treated in intensive care units. The sharp rise in new daily cases in August, and local outbreaks coinciding with the late opening of the tourist season after two months of strict lockdown, have led the government to impose new social distancing measures and restrictions. From Monday, bars, cafes and restaurants in many parts of the country, including the capital Athens, will have to close at midnight and not reopen before 7am. South African president Cyril Ramaphosa said on Saturday that all indications were that South Africa had reached the peak of Covid-19 infections, as he announced a sweeping removal of lockdown restrictions on the economy. In a televised address, Ramaphosa said the government would end the ban on alcohol and tobacco, allow restaurants and taverns to return to normal business, subject to strict hygiene regulations, and remove the ban on travel between provinces. “All indications are that South Africa has reached the peak and moved beyond the inflection point of the curve,” Ramaphosa said, adding that the cabinet had decided to move to lower, “level two” restrictions from midnight on Monday. “The move to level two means that we can remove nearly all of the restrictions on the resumption of economic activity across most industries,” he said. He said a fall in the infection rates, as well as people recovering, were “significantly reducing the pressure on our health facilities”, but he cautioned that cases could easily surge if people fail to maintain vigilance. Restrictions on international travel remained in place, he said. South Africa has more than half a million cases, but the rate of infections has declined over the past two weeks. One person who tested positive for coronavirus in Wales has died, bringing the country’s total number of deaths since the beginning of the pandemic to 1,587. Public Health Wales said the total number of cases in the country increased by 27, bringing the revised total of confirmed cases to 17,543. Students in Saudi Arabian public schools will be educated via distance learning for the first seven weeks of the new school year, the country’s minister of education said on Saturday, as a precaution against the spread of coronavirus. During that time, the situation for the remainder of the school year will be evaluated, Hamad bin Mohammed Al Shaikh said in remarks carried on the state-run al-Ekhbariya TV channel, according to Reuters. University and technical schools will be online for theory-based curriculums and in person for practical curriculums, he added. Saudi Arabia has seen more than 297,000 cases of coronavirus. Malta posted its highest ever one-day rise in coronavirus cases on Saturday, as the small Mediterranean island nation faces a recent uptick in infections due to more summer gatherings. Health authorities said they recorded 72 new Covid-19 infections between Friday and Saturday, a record since the first case was identified in the country on 7 March. New infections have been increasing significantly in Malta in the past three weeks following a period in mid-July when the country enjoyed eight consecutive days with no new cases, AFP reports. As of the latest update, the nation of nearly half a million people had 557 current cases of coronavirus for a total of 1,348 infections. Nine people have died. The Maltese government recently introduced some restrictions on mass events and gatherings, but has thus far steered clear of reimplementing the more stringent lockdown measures it imposed in March and gradually lifted from May. Two new testing hubs have also been opened by health authorities in an effort to deal with a backlog of appointments for swab tests. Twelve European countries have removed Malta from their safe travel list, with quarantine – and in some cases a coronavirus test – required for those who return to most of these countries from Malta. Many of the new infections identified in recent weeks in neighbouring Italy have been due to young summer partygoers returning home after a holiday in Malta. Turkey confirmed 1,256 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, the highest daily rise in infections since June, Sky reports. Turkey recorded 21 Covid-19 deaths in the last 24 hours, health minister Fahrettin Koca said on Twitter on Saturday. The country has seen cases edge higher in recent weeks and has now recorded a total of 278,117, with 5,955 deaths. Turkey lifted a partial lockdown on 1 June and plans to re-open schools next month. The French health ministry on Saturday reported 3,310 new coronavirus infections in France over the past 24 hours, setting a new post-lockdown high for the fourth day in a row and taking the country’s cumulative cases to 215,521. A total of 252 clusters were being investigated, up 17 compared with 24 hours earlier, the ministry said in a website update. France said on Saturday evening that 4,857 people are in hospital with Covid-19, including 376 people in intensive care units. This week’s upswing has taken the seven-day moving average of new infections above the 2,000 threshold for the first time since 20 April, when France was in the middle of one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns. The resurgence prompted Britain to impose a 14-day quarantine for people arriving from France, fuelling a rush by British travellers to return home before an early Saturday deadline. A relatively high incidence in Paris also led the authorities to expand zones in the capital where wearing a mask is mandatory outdoors. But doctors are increasingly calling for masks to be required in the workplace as they see people mingling in confined spaces as a bigger risk factor, Reuters reports. The HCSP, a body advising the government on health policy, issued a recommendation calling for masks to be compulsory in all common indoor spaces. The government last month made wearing a mask obligatory in shops but not in other businesses. The number of people in hospital has trended downwards in recent weeks even as new Covid-19 cases have risen, with experts pointing to the spread of the virus among younger people. However, the latest daily figures showed a slight rise in the number of hospital patients, at 4,857 against 4,828 a day earlier, as well as a rise in intensive care patients to 376 from 367. Ireland reported 200 new Covid-19 cases arising from multiple clusters across the country on Saturday, the highest daily amount since the beginning of May. The country’s chief medical officer described this as “deeply concerning”. Ireland has reopened its economy at a slower pace than most European Union countries but that did not stop a rise in cases over the last two weeks that led to the first localised reimposition of some restrictions last week. “We now have multiple clusters with secondary spread of disease and rising numbers of cases in many parts of the country. This is deeply concerning. NPHET [Ireland’s public health team] will monitor this extremely closely over the coming days,” Ronan Glynn said in a statement. Berlin’s brothels were allowed to reopen last week after months of closure due to coronavirus restrictions - but full-on sex is still off-limits. Instead, clients looking for sexual healing in the German capital will have to make do with erotic massages until regulations are further relaxed in September. And it’s not just the clients who have been left frustrated by the partial easing of regulations. Sex work had been banned in Berlin since mid-March as part of efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus, AFP reports. In July, several dozen prostitutes armed with inflatable sex dolls staged a protest outside the Bundesrat upper house of parliament in Berlin, complaining that continued restrictions were preventing them from making a living and pushing their trade underground. Prostitution is legal and regulated in Germany, with the country’s 40,000 registered sex workers entitled to employment contracts and social security benefits. Anyone can get a coronavirus test at the CentroMed clinic in San Antonio, Texas, but on a recent day, the drive-thru was empty, the Associated Press reports. With hundreds of deaths reported each day, students returning to class, and football teams charging ahead with plans to play, Texas’s leaders who have grappled with testing shortages for much of the pandemic are now facing the opposite problem: not enough takers. “We’re not having enough people step forward,” Republican governor Greg Abbott said. The number of coronavirus tests being done each day in Texas has dropped by the thousands in August, mirroring nationwide trends that have seen daily testing averages in the US fall nearly 9% since the end of July, according to the Covid Tracking Project. The dropoff comes as the US has surpassed 5 million confirmed coronavirus cases and is closing in on 170,000 deaths. It threatens to put the US even further behind other countries that have better managed the pandemic, in part through more aggressive testing. The trend worries health experts: Texas embarked on one of the fastest reopenings in the country in May, but retreated weeks later in the face of massive outbreaks, ultimately leading Abbott to impose a statewide mask order after previously saying he wouldn’t. At one point, one overwhelmed hospital on the Texas border was airlifting Covid-19 patients hundreds of miles north in search of open beds, and Houston this month began threatening $250 (£190) fines for not wearing face coverings in an effort to drive down infection numbers. In recent weeks, things have improved, including a nearly 40% drop in hospitalisations since July’s peak. But deaths remain high, and doctors in some parts say they’re still stretched. Texas has been averaging more than 210 reported new deaths a day over the past two weeks, according to the Covid Tracking Project. On Friday, it reported 313 deaths. Overall, the state has recorded more than 9,600 fatalities. The rolling average of people who test positive for the virus in Texas is stubbornly elevated at 16%, a figure that itself could be a sign of insufficient testing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said a positivity rate under 10% is an indicator that a state has robust testing. Abbott has said that unless Texas gets below that number, bars are likely to stay shut. Other states in the South clobbered by the virus this summer are also seeing improvements, including Alabama. Intensive care units remain frustratingly full there, but the average number of new confirmed cases each day has dropped below 1,000, from 1,800 in mid-July. Migrant arrivals to Italy increased by nearly 150% over the past year with an overwhelming majority arriving from Tunisia and war-riven Libya, Italy’s interior ministry said on Saturday. Italy says it has been struggling to deal with daily arrivals of hundreds of migrants to its southern shores, a task further complicated by coronavirus-linked security measures, AFP reports. With frustration growing among local mayors, the government has chartered massive ferry ships to hold migrants under quarantine and called in the army for help. From the start of August last year to the end of July this year, 21,618 migrants arrived at Italy’s shores – 148.7% higher than the 8,691 landings a year earlier, according to data presented by interior minister Luciana Lamorgese. Despite the sharp rise, the number of migrant arrivals is still far below numbers recorded in recent years. From 2016 to 2017, Italy recorded 182,877 migrant arrivals. After Italy signed a deal with Libya for its coastguard to prevent migrant departures, the number fell to 42,700 in the 2017-18 period. Lamorgese said the difficulty was not the number of arrivals but the extra work required by anti-Covid-19 security measures. “There is a need for a protection system both for the populations receiving the migrants and for the migrants themselves,” she said. Migrants testing positive for Covid-19 present logistical challenges within the reception centres where they are brought. “Swabbing is done and, when positive, the person has to be treated while the others have to observe an isolation of 14 days,” Lamorgese said. Some 41.6% of the migrants who arrived over the past year departed from Tunisia, followed by Libya at 40.5%. Over a third of those who arrived listed Tunisian as their nationality. Tunisia is battling high unemployment and political instability, pushing more economic migrants to cross to Italy. Lamorgese said she planned to make a trip to Tunisia on Monday with foreign minister Luigi Di Maio and two European Union commissioners. The chairman of Ireland’s tourism authority has resigned after defying government guidance to avoid all non-essential travel by going on holiday to Italy, my colleague Aaron Walawalkar reports. Michael Cawley, Ryanair’s former chief operating officer, handed in his resignation on Saturday after details of his Italian excursion were revealed by the Irish Independent. The Roman Catholic church’s annual Assumption celebrations took place in Lourdes on Saturday with fewer pilgrims than usual making the trip to the south-west of France because of the global health crisis. For the first time, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Vatican Secretary of State and right-hand man of Pope Francis, presided over the mass at the grotto, delivering a message of “hope” to a “world that knows darkness, fear”, referring in particular to the coronavirus pandemic, AFP reports. Nearly 5,000 pilgrims took their place in the Basilica of Saint Pius X, a gigantic underground church as large as two football fields, which can hold five times as many. The organisers then closed access to the underground basilica, inviting pilgrims to follow on screens outside. “It’s weird. There aren’t many people this year,” said Michel Clavel, a retired 66-year-old truck driver, who comes every year for the Assumption pilgrimage. “In general, 15 August is the big crowd. Because of the coronavirus, there are no organised trips for sick people who come [by] train, plane or coach.” Wearing a mask was compulsory and scrupulously respected. A few dozen patients, some in wheelchairs, were in the front row but because of the sanitary precautions, the large numbers of people in poor health who normally travel to Lourdes in search of a miraculous cure were absent. The cave where, according to Catholic tradition, the Virgin Mary appeared to Bernadette Soubirous in 1858, is closed to the public, because pilgrims are used to putting their hands on the walls and kissing the stone. After a two-month closure the sanctuaries of Lourdes have been gradually opening up, but the large contingents of foreign pilgrims are missing and many hotels and souvenir shops remain closed. The United Kingdom has recorded 1,012 new coronavirus infections on Saturday, the fifth day in a row more than 1,000 infections have been reported in daily figures. Britain has now recorded 317,379 Covid-19 cases. A further three people were reported to have died after testing positive for coronavirus. The government also said 41,361 people have died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, as of Saturday. Separate figures published by the UK’s statistics agencies show there have been 56,800 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. Germany’s health minister, Jens Spahn, criticised “party holidays” on Saturday, as bar owners in Mallorca, Spain, a popular destination for German holidaymakers, feared the news that Germany declared most of the country a coronavirus risk region on Friday would be the death knell for their already-struggling businesses. “We live in fear here. We don’t know what tomorrow will bring,” said Gelinde from Munich who owns Casa Baviera bar. “We are not afraid of the virus, but we are afraid of what our livelihood will be like.” There are currently around 30,000 Germans on holiday with tour operators in Spain’s Balearic islands, the vast majority in Mallorca, plus more independent travellers, the German travel association said. TUI, the world’s largest tourism company, said it was cancelling all German package holidays to Spain with immediate effect until 24 August, appealing to customers already there to return within seven days. “If I close I will be unable to reopen again ... I have no help. How are we supposed to move on from this?” said Antonia Gost, owner of La Tapita bar in Palma, in response to TUI’s decision to cancel all holidays to the island, Reuters reports. Hello, I’m taking over for the next few hours. As ever, feel free to get in touch with updates relating to the pandemic from wherever you are, you can get me on Twitter at @JedySays or via email. Tens of thousands of UK tourists in France made last-ditch bids to return home before the imposition of quarantine restrictions at 4am today. Tickets for planes, trains and ferries were snapped up by travellers at increased prices as they attempted to beat the deadline. Governments around the world – including the UK – face a wave of lawsuits from foreign companies who complain that their profits have been hit by the pandemic. Webinars and presentations shared with clients reveal that leading global law firms anticipate governments around the world will soon face claims over their response to the Covid-19 crisis. The actions are being brought under investor state dispute settlement (ISDS) clauses which are embedded in trade and investment agreements and allow foreign investors and firms to sue other countries’ governments. The claims are heard in highly secretive ad hoc tribunals before a panel of three judges. Often it is not apparent that a case is being brought until the panel sits. The law firm Alston &amp; Bird used a recent webinar to predict that the UK would be sued over Sadiq Khan’s decision to close Crossrail construction sites during the pandemic. The decision was at odds with the government’s policy of allowing sites to operate throughout lockdown, an inconsistency that they say opens up the way for a legal challenge. Law firm Reed Smith has predicted that measures taken by governments to deal with the crisis are affecting investments “directly and significantly and could give rise to substantial claims”. And Ropes &amp; Gray has issued an alert advising clients to consider actions brought under investment treaties as “a powerful tool to recover or prevent loss resulting from Covid-19-related government actions”. There are particular concerns about claims being brought against governments in the developing world. Almost half of all Brazilians think president Jair Bolsonaro bears “no responsibility at all” for the country’s more than 100,000 dead from the coronavirus pandemic, the world’s second highest death toll, according to a new Datafolha poll. Reuters reports: The poll was published on Saturday in Brazil’s Folha de São Paulo newspaper and says 47% of Brazilians do not assign him any blame for the body count, whereas 11% do. Brazil has the world’s worst outbreak outside of the United States and Bolsonaro’s response to the pandemic has been widely condemned by health experts. Rightwing Bolsonaro has pushed for the use of an unproven anti-malarial drug to fight the disease, replaced health ministers who opposed his agenda, encouraged Brazilians to oppose lockdown measures and shown indifference to the rising death toll. Four more people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals to 29,456, NHS England said on Saturday, PA reports. The patients were aged between 66 and 88 and they all had known underlying health conditions. Six deaths have been reported with no positive Covid-19 test result. It should have been a great year for Spanish wine: a bumper crop of grapes resulting in millions and millions of extra bottles for sipping or swilling at home and abroad. But with Covid-19 leading to a catastrophic drop in wine sales, the Spanish government is offering growers subsidies to destroy part of this year’s record grape harvest. Faced with over-production in a shrinking market, €90m is to be spent either on destruction or on the distilling of grapes into brandy and industrial alcohol. Lower limits have also been set on the amount of wine that can be produced per hectare – and have already been imposed on makers of cava, Rueda and Rioja. This year’s grape harvest is expected to produce 43 million hectolitres of wine, compared with 37 million in recent years. Even without Covid, this exceeds the combined domestic and international demand of 31 million hectolitres, but, to make matters worse, restaurant sales have fallen by 65% and exports by 49% since the start of the pandemic. You can read Nosheen Iqbal’s full dispatch here: The German health minister defended a decision to declare nearly all of Spain, including the tourist island of Mallorca, a coronavirus risk region following a rise in cases there, Reuters reports. Jens Spahn told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper: I know how much the Germans love Spain ... But unfortunately the infection rates there are rising sharply, too sharply. Whoever goes to Spain despite the warning should protect themselves and others while on holiday. Party holidays are irresponsible in this pandemic. People returning to Germany from designated risk regions face a coronavirus test or two weeks’ compulsory quarantine. Spahn’s comments came as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany rose by 1,415, the biggest increase since late April, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed today. Infections in Spain have also risen in recent days after it ended a tough lockdown seven weeks ago. The German move deals a new blow to hopes for a swift revival of mass tourism after months of lockdown all but wiped out this year’s high season. The first set of quarantiners from France began arriving at Gatwick airport at 10.20am on Saturday, missing the UK deadline to get back by a handful of hours. Returning holidaymakers expressed fury, resignation and confusion as five flights from the south of France arrived within an hour. Reda, who had spent two weeks in Bordeaux with his wife, Elodie, and their five-year-old daughter, Sara, said: How does it make sense? Either you allow people proper time to stagger getting back or you say quarantine is effective immediately. A 12- or 24-hour deadline just means that 100,000 people rushed back one day earlier than us.. They’re more high risk because of that, and we are in quarantine and they’re out in open spaces. British holidaymakers have arrived back from France with minutes to spare before the new quarantine deadline, PA reports. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, announced late on Thursday that anyone arriving from France after 4am on Saturday would be required to quarantine for 14 days because of rising coronavirus cases in the country. Matt, a teacher from Manchester, took his car on a Channel Tunnel train which was due to arrive back in the UK at 3.55am. His family had been camping in the Dordogne and had planned to come home on Monday but changed their tickets for an extra £115. The family drove for 10 hours to Calais to catch the train and spent another £66 to stay at a hotel in the early hours before driving on to Manchester. “We literally got on the last available train ... we’d been keeping up to date with the chaos at Calais so we were fearing the worst,” he said. “Luckily, once we got to Calais we sailed through and actually got back at just gone 3am.” Matt said he did not want his family to be in quarantine on his daughter’s eighth birthday next Friday, and the new measures would also have prevented a trip to see family in Scotland next weekend. An Oxford college said it would accept all students with offers regardless of their A-level results, as thousands of Oxbridge alumni call on others to show equal “kindness and generosity” to downgraded pupils. Laura Ashe, the tutor for admissions at Worcester College, Oxford, said it had decided to honour all UK offers this year because it is the “morally right thing to do”.

If you have any tips or suggestions for coverage, please DM me on Twitter at @AaronWala or email me at aaron.walawalkar.casual@theguardian.com. Vietnam’s health ministry reported 21 new coronavirus infections and two deaths today, Reuters reports, bringing the total number of cases in the south-east Asian country to 950, with 23 fatalities. More than 470 of the cases are linked to the central city of Danang, where a new outbreak began late last month. The ministry said 115,858 people were being quarantined, including 4,182 at hospitals, 25,952 at centralised quarantine centres and the rest at home. Public health experts, researchers and manufacturers say the coming flu season could bring a twin respiratory disease outbreak in the US, just as autumn and winter are expected to exacerbate the spread of Covid-19. At the same time, researchers said the strategies currently used to prevent coronavirus transmission – namely, hand-washing, mask-wearing and physical distancing – could also help lessen flu outbreaks, if Americans are willing to practice them. “We will be faced with basically a double-barrel respiratory virus season, both influenza and Covid,” said Dr William Schaffner, medical director for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases and a professor of medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Tennessee. AFP reports: When Keiron Marshall was 15, he found his way out of a desperate situation with help from an unexpected source: Eric Clapton. The guitarist hosted the first gig Marshall ever attended, and he was joined on stage by Gary Brooker of Procol Harum, The Who’s Pete Townshend and Ringo Starr from the Beatles. Since then, London’s music scene has been a liferaft for Marshall, a musician who now runs a group of small concert venues with his wife. Growing up in south London, he’d endured racial slurs and regular beatings because of his Pakistani heritage. His uncle was killed in a racially motivated attack; his mother was a heroin addict. “Music for us is a really personal thing”, said Hannah White, Marshall’s wife. “Its been totally life-changing.” But the music scene they know and love may soon be unrecognisable because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has plunged the UK economy into its worst recession on record. Live music venues have been forced to shut doors for nearly five months – and scores are at imminent risk of permanent closure. According to the charity Music Venue Trust, which represents 670 grassroots venues, more than 400 across the country are in crisis. One of those is Marshall and White’s south London venue group, the Sound Lounge. The government announced on Saturday that indoor and physically distanced live music could resume. But this does not mean that the live music scene will be immediately restored. Wearing face masks on public transport will be compulsory in Denmark from 22 August after a spike in new coronavirus cases, Mette Frederiksen, the prime minister, said today, according to a report by Reuters. In mid-April, Denmark became one the first European countries to ease its coronavirus lockdown as the epidemic appeared to be contained, but the reproduction rate at which it is spreading rose above 1.5 in the past week, the highest reading since early April. Frederiksen said the surge also meant that plans to remove a limit on the size of public gatherings would be deferred, with the limit remaining at 100 people for the time being. Theatres, casinos and bowling alleys are opening today as part of the latest easing of lockdown restrictions in England, Jessica Murray and Alex Mistlin report: From Saturday, physically distanced audiences will be allowed back into indoor venues, while wedding receptions of up to 30 people will also be permitted. Tattoo studios, beauty salons, spas and hairdressers will all be able to offer additional services, including front-of-face treatments such as eyebrow threading. Danielle Simm, manager of Kolo Hair and Beauty, said she was excited to be starting up beauty treatments, with a huge waiting list of keen customers. “I had a massive list full of clients ready. I said I’d open up on the Sunday [2 August] and then obviously Boris [Johnson] didn’t even give us 24 hours’ notice and it all got cancelled. People are literally desperate,” Simm said. Historians will savage Jair Bolsonaro for leading Brazilians into a deadly “canyon” with his shambling, self-interested and anti-scientific response to Covid-19, according to his former health minister. In an interview with the Guardian, Luiz Henrique Mandetta accused the Brazilian president of playing a pivotal role in steering Latin America’s largest economy towards a catastrophe. Bolsonaro played politics with citizens’ lives at a time of global crisis, he said, as Brazil’s death toll rose to more than 105,000. Only the US has suffered more deaths. Mandetta, who has hinted he will challenge Bolsonaro for the presidency in 2022, became a household name in the early stages of the pandemic. He drew praise from the left and the right for his accessible, science-based alerts over the threat of coronavirus during daily press conferences. A 55-year-old orthopaedic doctor, Mandetta was elected to congress in 2010 and has faced criticism for opposing the Mais Médicos (More Doctors) health scheme that sent Cuban doctors to remote and deprived parts of Brazil. He was named health minister in November 2018, shortly after Bolsonaro’s surprise victory. But he was sacked in mid-April after publicly challenging Bolsonaro’s sabotaging of physical distancing. Speaking from his base in the midwestern city of Campo Grande, he said the two had not spoken since. Businesses welcome customers back through their doors today as part of the latest easing of lockdown restrictions in England. PA reports: Businesses have said they are delighted to be welcoming customers back through their doors on Saturday as part of the latest easing of lockdown restrictions in England. It comes after the prime minister announced that fines for repeatedly refusing to wear a mask could soar to £3,200 and organisers of illegal raves could face a £10,000 penalty. Casinos and bowling alleys are among the venues now allowed to reopen under the latest guidance. Physically distanced audiences are also now allowed back into theatres and other indoor venues, while wedding receptions of up to 30 people will be permitted. The move to allow indoor performances follows a “successful series of pilots”, Downing Street said. Tattoo studios, beauty salons, spas and hairdressers can now offer additional services, including front-of-face treatments such as eyebrow threading. The lockdown restrictions were due to be eased on 1 August, but a spike in coronavirus cases at the time resulted in a pause for two weeks. A spike in new coronavirus cases in South Korea has prompted authorities to reimpose tighter physical distancing regulations in Seoul, but that didn’t stop thousands of demonstrators from protesting against President Moon Jae-in’s policies. Reuters reports: For the second day in a row in over four months, the country has reported a sudden jump in locally transmitted cases, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said. The KCDC reported 166 new cases as of Friday, of which 155 were domestic, prompting authorities to reintroduce antivirus measures as they worried about the spectre of a fresh wave of the disease. The tougher rules come as thousands staged demonstrations in downtown Seoul, despite a ban on rallies in the capital city, with some conservative groups protesting against Moon’s recent real estate market policy and a series of sex scandals involving leaders of his administration. Reuters reports: Russia has started manufacturing its new vaccine for Covid-19, the Interfax news agency reported on Saturday, citing the health ministry. Russia has said the vaccine, developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute and the first for coronavirus to go into production, will be rolled out by the end of this month. Scientists said they feared Moscow might be putting national prestige before safety. Russia has reported 5,061 new coronavirus cases and 119 deaths in the past 24 hours, compared with 5,065 new cases and 114 deaths on Friday. Hi, I’m Aamna Mohdin and I’ll be taking over the liveblog for the rest of the day. If you want to get in touch, you can email me (aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com) or tweet me. I’m handing the blog over to my colleague Aamna Mohdin in London. I’ll leave you with some of the key events of the day so far: South Korea tightened coronavirus measures on Saturday in Seoul and its surrounding areas as the country reported the highest number of new daily infections in more than five months. New Zealand authorities are investigating whether a new coronavirus outbreak in the country could be linked to the wave of Covid-19 infections in the Australian state of Victoria. The country’s director general of health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, said he had been in contact with health officials in Victoria about an outbreak at an Americold cold storage facility in Melbourne. New Zealand recorded seven new cases of Covid-19 up to Saturday morning after the extension of the lockdown in Auckland. Six of the seven cases are linked to the cluster at the centre of the outbreak. The Australian state of Victoria recorded 303 new cases of Covid-19 and four deaths, two men and a woman in their 80s and a woman in her 90s. Two of the deaths are linked to outbreaks in aged care facilities. The Australian state of New South Wales recorded nine new cases with officials urging people who dined at Chopstix Asian Cuisine in Smithfield RSL club from Friday 31 July to Saturday 9 August to monitor for symptoms and immediately get tested and self-isolate if symptoms occur. Anyone who was at Rick Stein at Bannisters in Mollymook on Saturday 1 August needs to get tested and self-isolate immediately until midnight tonight or until they have received a negative result, whichever is later. From AFP: Thousands of UK holidaymakers scrambled to get home to beat new restrictions on arrivals from European countries as a second wave of virus infections threatened more disruption and economic chaos on the continent. France and the Netherlands were removed from a list of quarantine-exempt countries on Friday, sparking a rush for plane, train and ferry tickets by Britons hoping to get home before 4am (0300 GMT) Saturday, after which arrivals will have to self-isolate for 14 days. France is facing a resurgent wave of the disease that emerged in China late last year and has so far infected more than 21 million people and killed more than 750,000 around the world. Authorities in France have reported more than 2,500 new cases for the past three days – levels not seen since May. One British couple said they had spent nearly £1,000 (€1,105) to make it home via Eurostar from central France. My colleague Patrick Collinson writes that Britain’s charity shops are struggling with sales declines of as much as one-third, despite enjoying bumper stock levels – and offering huge savings – following a surge in donations after households “decluttered” during lockdown. Oxfam, which has 595 shops, said that money coming through its tills is down by 32% on a like-for-like basis compared to last year. The British Heart Foundation, which has around 740 shops, said income is currently down around 20%, with Barnardo’s and Cancer Research UK saying they are suffering similar declines. In case you missed it earlier, my colleague Daniel Hurst has written this story about the Australian government’s homebuilder scheme: Fewer than 250 people have applied for the Morrison government’s homebuilder scheme, officials have revealed, despite the hype from an industry association that it was the “most effective stimulus in decades”. Appearing before the Senate’s Covid-19 select committee on Friday, Treasury officials revealed that the government was only aware of 247 formal applications so far. These included 157 in South Australia and 90 in Tasmania. South Korea tightened coronavirus measures on Saturday in Seoul and its surrounding areas as the country reported the highest number of new daily infections in more than five months, AFP reports. The stricter social distancing guidelines include restrictions on gatherings and activities including professional sports, which will be played behind closed doors in the capital area again. The move came as South Korea reported 166 new cases on Saturday, the highest daily figure since early March, bringing the country’s total infections to 15,039 with 305 deaths. South Korea stands at a “critical juncture” in the battle to control the coronavirus surge, prime minister Chung Sye-kyun said at a government response meeting. “Our top priority is to contain the spread of the virus in the greater Seoul area.” A majority of the new cases came from the greater Seoul region – home to half of the country’s 51 million people – raising fears about a major spike with a three-day weekend starting in South Korea from Saturday. South Korea endured one of the worst early outbreaks outside mainland China but brought it broadly under control with extensive tracing and testing while never imposing the kind of lockdowns ordered in much of Europe and other parts of the world. The country has been seen as a model on how to combat the pandemic with the public largely following safety health measures such as face masks. It even started allowing limited numbers of spectators at sports games in July – which was reversed for the greater Seoul region on Saturday. This story, about a distressed staff member at an aged care home in Victoria pleading for help, is devastating. From my colleagues Melissa Davey, Lisa Cox and Stuart MacFarlane. “There are NO staff available – we are begging for help with regard to staffing, and no one wants to place themselves in the ‘hot zone’. Therefore, it is all up to our depleted staff to help, feed, bathe, medicate and attend to residents who are basically dying.” New Zealand authorities say they are investigating whether the new outbreak there could be linked to Victoria. At a press conference on Saturday, the country’s director general of health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, said he had been in contact with health officials in Victoria about an outbreak at an Americold cold storage facility in Melbourne. You’ll be aware that we have been doing some environmental testing as well at the Americold store in Mt Wellington, that is being processed today. I have also had contact from my counterpart in Victoria who has linked me with their lab there, that is doing some genome sequencing on some [coronavirus] cases of employees in an Americold cool store there in Melbourne, just again to see if there is any possible linkage there, so we are looking at that possibility, it’s part of the overall puzzle and we are leaving no stone unturned. Here’s a quick breakdown of some of the numbers in Victoria at the moment. There are currently: 3,383 cases in the state which may indicate community transmission. 7,875 active cases. 661 people are in hospital, including 41 in intensive care, 8,121 people have recovered from the virus. More than 1,937,700 tests have been processed. Of the total cases: 15,163 cases are from metropolitan Melbourne, while 997 are from regional Victoria. The total cases include 7,961 men and 8,512 women There are 1,178 active cases among healthcare workers, and 2,259 in total. There are 2,041 active cases relating to aged care facilities. Active aged care outbreaks with the highest case numbers: 204 cases have been linked to Epping Gardens Aged Care in Epping. 190 cases have been linked to St Basil’s Homes for the Aged in Fawkner. 155 cases have been linked to Estia Aged Care Facility in Ardeer. 130 cases have been linked to Kirkbrae Presbyterian Homes in Kilsyth. 124 cases have been linked to BaptCare Wyndham Lodge Community in Werribee. 108 cases have been linked to Outlook Gardens Aged Care Facility in Dandenong North. 101 cases have been linked to Estia Aged Care Facility in Heidelberg. 93 cases have been linked to Twin Parks Aged Care in Reservoir. 91 cases have been linked to Arcare Aged Care Facility in Craigieburn. 83 cases have been linked to Glendale Aged Care Facility in Werribee. Cases currently linked to key outbreaks are as follows: 203 cases have been linked to Bertocchi Smallgoods in Thomastown. 186 cases have been linked to Al-Taqwa College. 142 cases have been linked to JBS Brooklyn. 142 cases have been linked to Royal Melbourne Hospital Royal Park campus. 29 cases have been linked to Hazeldene’s Chicken Farm in Bendigo. 28 cases have been linked to Werribee Mercy Hospital. 27 cases have been linked to Coles Laverton Distribution centre. 21 cases have been linked to Jayco in Dandenong. The Australian state of Western Australia has reported one new case of Covid-19 overnight, bringing the state’s total to 646. The case is a man in his 30s in hotel quarantine. There are now five active cases in WA. Four Australian men have been caught trying to dodge state border restrictions by sailing a houseboat from New South Wales to their home in Cairns, Queensland. AAP reports that the men were intercepted in Gold Coast waters on Friday after leaving the NSW north-coast town of Coffs Harbour on Wednesday. The four men on board the 14-metre catamaran were allegedly trying to make the journey home to Cairns, a journey of over 2,000km. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said it proved those who tried to flout border restrictions by any means would be caught. “They have all been fined for making a false declaration, and are now enjoying hotel quarantine at their own expense,” she told reporters on Saturday. The premier also confirmed two members of a cargo ship off the Queensland coast who tested positive to coronavirus on Friday have now been evacuated to hospital. Coronavirus cases in Latin America, the region of the world worst-affected by the pandemic, exceeded six million on Friday and continued to accelerate, according to a tally compiled by Reuters, as most of its nations begin to relax lockdown measures. The region, which has reported an average of more than 86,000 daily infections of the new coronavirus in the last seven days and more than 2,600 Covid-19 deaths, reached 6,000,005 confirmed cases by Friday evening and 237,360 deaths. That accounts for just under one-third of the world’s total case load and a similar share of reported deaths from the pandemic. The Pan American Health Organization, the regional arm of the World Health Organisation, warned this month of an increase in other diseases due to the saturation of health services and the suspension of routine vaccination campaigns as a result of the pandemic. The International Monetary Fund predicted in June that the regional economy would contract 9.4% this year. The region’s worst-affected country is Brazil, which has the most cases in the world after the US, and 15% of world’s total. Peru and Chile also have the highest case loads and number of deaths in the world per 100,000 inhabitants, of countries with more than 100,000 cases. The region’s climb from five million to six million cases took 11 days, one day less than it took to reach the previous million. Our photographer Mike Bowers took these snaps of a flyover Parliament House in Canberra to mark the 75th anniversary of the end of World War Two this morning. Here is a little more on those New Zealand numbers: New Zealand reported seven new cases of coronavirus up to Saturday morning after a lockdown in Auckland was extended. Six of the seven new cases were linked to the cluster at the centre of all the previous community cases, said Ashley Bloomfield, the director general of health. Up to Saturday, the authorities in New Zealand have reported 37 cases connected to the outbreak with 19 other people in quarantine. The lockdown in Auckland, home to 1.7 million people, was extended for nearly two weeks after New Zealand reported 12 confirmed cases of Covid-19 on Friday. The outbreak has delayed the start of the New Zealand women’s provincial rugby competition for at least two weeks. It had been scheduled to start on 22 August. For an overview of what is happening internationally, we have this from AFP: Countries among the hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic unveiled further measures on Friday to battle rising infections, as the number of cases worldwide passed 21 million. The US Department of Homeland Security said it was extending a ban on non-essential travel through border crossings with Canada and Mexico throughout most of September “to slow the spread” of the disease. Meanwhile Britain added France to its list of countries hit with a mandatory two-week quarantine for returning holidaymakers from Saturday, as Paris confronts a resurgent second wave of infections. Confirmed cases in France reached levels not seen since May on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, at over 2,500 new cases per day. The rising threat prompted Paris police to announce on Friday that compulsory mask-wearing outside would be extended to more areas of the French capital, including the famed Louvre museum and Champs-Elysee avenue. “If the epidemiological situation deteriorates again, mask-wearing could become compulsory throughout the capital,” Paris police warned, also banning gatherings and protests of more than 10 people which do not comply with distancing measures. Neighbouring Spain said it would close all nightclubs and ban smoking in the street where people are unable to stay at a safe distance, after the country reported almost 3,000 cases in 24 hours on Thursday. In Germany, the Robert Koch Institute for disease control added all of Spain except the Canary Islands to its list of regions where incoming travellers must show a negative test for Covid-19 or quarantine for 14 days. Austria urged its citizens to return from popular Mediterranean destination Croatia before similar rules come into effect on Monday, while Serbia introduced mandatory testing for travellers from four neighbouring countries. And thousands of Albanians queued in their cars at the Greek border, hoping to squeeze across and return to work before tougher entry requirements designed to brake mounting infections come into effect. Some people had been waiting for three days in the 20km (12-mile), 4,000-car jam, an Albanian police source said. Queensland and the ACT have both recorded no new Covid-19 cases on Saturday. Queensland has only nine active cases remaining, while there are no active cases in the ACT. Vietnam has registered to buy the new Russian Covid-19 vaccine, even as scientists raise concerns about the speed of its development and suggest researchers might be cutting corners. Following Russia’s approval of a controversial Covid-19 vaccine for widespread use after less than two months of human testing, Vietnamese state television has reported the country is looking to buy a bulk order of the so-called “Sputnik” vaccine. The Bangkok Post reports the country’s health ministry has not said how many doses of the Russian vaccine it had ordered, or when it expected to receive them. And that’s all from Victoria. On to the really important stuff now. Andrews is asked whether, if the AFL grand final is relocated out of Victoria, there will still be a public holiday in the state. Well, it will still be the Friday before the grand final. So I would say yes. I reckon, I reckon Victorians may well have earned that ... No matter where the grand final is played, and if some in the business community want to have a crack at me today, if that makes them feel better then fine. Daniel Andrews steps back up to make some comments on outbreaks in workplaces. He says there is a “broader point” about insecure work: Insecure work is toxic. There is nothing good about insecure work, and when this is done, when this virus has been beaten, we will need to commit ourselves to do something really significant about it. It is no good for anything, for families, for a sense of security [and] for public health, for any purpose. We have a lot of people who work very hard but have no safety net to fall back on and that is just not something we should settle for. The state’s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, says the relatively low four deaths in Victoria on Saturday is “probably a blip”. It probably is a blip. I think it is always pleasing not to have a day of 10 or 20 deaths, they are awful days. But the numbers will vary from day to day, and we note that with 2,000 infected residents and staff in aged care, a very vulnerable population, that we will see more deaths with those infections. Back in Victoria, Daniel Andrews is asked about what he thinks 2021 might look like. He says the best we can hope for is a “Covid normal” year. 2021 will not be a normal year, it will be at best a Covid normal year. Unless of course a vaccine can be developed, produced and administered, which I don’t think will be happening, all three of those things inside a year, I genuinely hope to be proven wrong and that, but that seems to be, despite very promising signs, that could be a long way off. So it is not normal we are looking for, it is a Covid normal. To New Zealand, where Reuters reports that seven cases of Covid-19 have been recorded in the past 24 hours. Six of the seven new cases have been linked to the cluster responsible for all the previous community cases, director general of health Ashley Bloomfield told a media briefing in Wellington. It comes as a lockdown in the country’s biggest city, Auckland, was extended on Friday in response to the country’s first Covid-19 outbreak in months. The lockdown in Auckland, home to 1.7 million people, was extended for nearly two weeks, after New Zealand reported 12 confirmed cases of Covid-19 on Friday. Andrews is asked about this exclusive Guardian Australia report on horrific footage of a 95-year-old woman in a Melbourne aged care facility struck by Covid-19, showing ants crawling from a wound on her leg and the bandages around it crusted with blood. He describes it as “shameful”. The footage “will be very distressing for everyone concerned”. I think that footage relates to a particular facility which we have now taken over, so I would hope, I would hope that any of those issues would be dealt with quickly. Hospital nurses have gone and taken over in a number of these situations and I think they have taken over for good reasons. It does not serve any purpose for me from this podium to kind of be a commentator on that system, I think the most important thing is to focus on the residents and their families and get the other side of this and provide the care and dignity that every single senior Victorian is fundamentally entitled to. Andrews is asked when he last had a day off: I couldn’t tell you. I don’t know. I don’t stop because this virus doesn’t stop. It’s not just me. It is a team of thousands. Thousands of people. Thousands and thousands of people who have never worked harder. Andrews is asked about reports in Melbourne newspapers today that the trajectory of cases suggests the state ease restrictions substantially by December. He says you can “try and extrapolate out about what months ahead look like” but that he hasn’t done that. I think it is too far away for us to have the clarity that we would need to make those assorted predictions ... We will get to the other side of this. We will. But for my judgement it is too early for us to be making predictions about when that is. Daniel Andrews is asked about reports that a Victorian handbag company has been making home deliveries to “well-heeled customers”. He says that home visits are only allowed in urgent cases and that handbag deliveries are not urgent. “There is nothing urgent about a luxury handbag,” he says. Sutton says the virus reproduction rate is now “almost certainly below one”. It can get to 0.4, 0.5, if everyone can do the right thing. That is where it was probably headed to in April when we were in another very substantial lockdown and we saw numbers drop very dramatically. If we can get to an effective reproduction number at a similar level we should see a similar reduction over time so that is encouraging. Victoria’s chief health officer Brett Sutton says the number of new cases in the state appears to have “stabilised”. People should have “hope and confidence the things we know work are now manifesting in our daily counts”, he says. It is not to say we will not continue to work extremely hard on addressing these challenging settings, but we are seeing the benefits of what everyone is doing in the community in wearing masks and getting tested and isolating when they have the very first symptoms and in complying with isolation and quarantine when contacted by the department. Andrews says Victoria has established a dedicated disability rapid response outbreak unit in conjunction with the commonwealth to deal with cases in that sector. He says the unit will be tasked with the “appropriate arrangements for infection prevention and control, additional PPE, in-home testing, and making sure we are keeping a very close eye and monitoring the health status and therefore the potential virus status of residents and clients”. There are currently 89 cases in the disability sector in Victoria. There are 184 deaths associated with aged care outbreaks, Andrews says. There are currently Covid-19 outbreaks in 124 aged care facilities in Victoria, 119 of those are in privately run aged care homes. Andrews says there are 3,383 cases from an unknown source, an increase of 264 in the past 24 hours. Before people see that as a very, very big increase on previous days, we have always made the point or try to that coronavirus detective work it’s all done in one hit. It does take time to try and work out, try to exhaust all possible sources and then to declare that case a mystery case. So they do come in batches, if you like. I would not read too much more into that, it is simply the product of multiple days’ work being brought to book, as it were, recorded in our numbers. Daniel Andrews is speaking now. As we heard there are 303 new cases of Covid-19 in Victoria. It brings the total number of confirmed cases in the state to 16,517 confirmed cases. There are now 293 deaths in Victoria, an increase of four since yesterday. The four new deaths are a female in her 80s, two males in their 80s and one female in her 90s. Two of the four are connected with aged care outbreaks. The Australian state of New South Wales recorded nine new cases of Covid-19 in the 24 hours to 8pm last night. The NSW health department reports that one of the new cases is a staff member of Chopstix Asian Cuisine in Smithfield RSL, whose source is unknown at this point. Another staff member at Chopstix Asian Cuisine, is likely a secondary infection from the above case. One is a student from Tangara School for Girls. One attended Mounties club at Mount Pritchard. Five are close contacts of known cases. Anyone who dined at Chopstix Asian Cuisine restaurant from Friday 31 July to Saturday 9 August is considered a casual contact who must monitor for symptoms and immediately get tested and self-isolate if symptoms occur. A case dined at Rick Stein at Bannisters in Mollymook on Saturday, 1 August. Anyone who was at the restaurant on this night between 8pm and 10.30pm for at least one hour is considered a close contact and must get tested for Covid-19 right away and self-isolate until midnight tonight or until they have received a negative result, whichever is later. This seems bad. Via the AP, the U.S. Postal Service is warning states coast to coast that it cannot guarantee all ballots cast by mail for the November election will arrive in time to be counted, even if mailed by state deadlines, raising the possibility that millions of voters could be disenfranchised. Voters and lawmakers in several states are also complaining that some curbside mail collection boxes are being removed. Even as President Donald Trump rails against wide-scale voting by mail, the post office is bracing for an unprecedented number of mail-in ballots as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The warning letters sent to states raise the possibility that many Americans eligible for mail-in ballots this fall will not have them counted. But that is not the intent, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said in his own letter to Democratic congressional leaders. The post office is merely asking elected officials and voters to realistically consider how the mail works, and be mindful of our delivery standards, in order to provide voters ample time to cast ballots through the mail,” wrote DeJoy, a prominent Trump political donor who was recently appointed. The back-and-forth comes amid a vigorous campaign by Trump to sow doubts about mail-in voting as he faces a difficult fight for re-election against Democrat Joe Biden. Though Trump casts his own ballots by mail, he has repeatedly criticised efforts to allow more people to do so, which he argues without evidence will lead to increased voter fraud that could cost him the election. Meanwhile, members of Congress from both parties have voiced concerns that curbside mail boxes, which is how many will cast their ballots, have abruptly been removed in some states. Officials in more than a dozen states, including the presidential election battlegrounds of Michigan and Pennsylvania, all confirmed to The Associated Press on Friday that they had received the warning letters. “This is a deeply troubling development in what is becoming a clear pattern of attempted voter suppression by the Trump administration”, Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said in a statement. “I am committed to making sure all Virginians have access to the ballot box, and will continue to work with state and federal lawmakers to ensure safe, secure and accessible elections this fall.” Kim Wyman, the Republican secretary of state in Washington state, where all voting is by mail, said sending fall ballot material to millions of voters there is a routine operation of the US Postal Service. “Politicizing these administrative processes is dangerous and undermines public confidence in our elections”, she said in a statement. “This volume of work is by no means unusual, and is an operation I am confident the US Postal Service is sufficiently prepared to fulfill.” The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, will hold a press conference at 11am. Australia is delivering humanitarian supplies to Beirut as the city continues to reel from a blast that left more than 170 people dead and 30,000 homeless. On Saturday the country’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced the delivery will include shelter kits and mobile warehouses to replace destroyed storage facilities, in addition to the $5m in aid already promised to organisations like the Red Cross Movement and Unicef. The federal government said the supplies will be distributed by trusted NGOs, including the Red Cross, and Australia’s UN partners. An Australian Defence Force C-130J Hercules aircraft based in the Middle East is touching down in the Lebanon capital on Saturday. Police in Victoria, Australia, have issued 223 fines to people in the past 24 hours for breaching the state’s tough lockdown measures. Twenty-seven of them were for failing to wear a face covering when leaving home, now mandatory in the state. Other fines included: A man who lives in Truganina and was allegedly located in Box Hill. Police said the man believed Covid-19 to be a conspiracy, and that he was targeted by police. A man who resides in Morwell allegedly travelled by train to Drouin so he could go for a walk. A driver in Wyndham was allegedly intercepted by police whilst on his way to buy fast food. Police said he was also watching Netflix on his phone whilst driving. Businesses in England are “delighted” to be welcoming customers back through their doors on Saturday, as part of the latest easing of lockdown restrictions in the country, the Press Association reports. A new raft of eased restrictions will come into place in England on Saturday, allowing businesses such as casinos and indoor theatres to reopen, while wedding receptions of up to 30 people will also be permitted. Tattoo studios, beauty salons, spas and hairdressers will all be able to offer additional services from Saturday, including front of face treatments such as eyebrow threading. Alice Bellamy, 67, from Calne in Wiltshire, has been a beauty therapist for 27 years and runs specialist laser hair removal studio Woman to Woman &amp; The Male Perspective Ltd. She said: “I am indeed delighted. One day’s notice is not amazing but it’s typical of the total ineptitude of this Government and its handling of this pandemic. “But I am overjoyed and so are my clients, my phone has been hot, hot, hot.” The lockdown restrictions were due to be eased on 1 August, but a spike in coronavirus cases at the time resulted in them being paused for two weeks. Meanwhile Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said an estimated 160,000 holidaymakers were expected to try to return to the UK from France on Friday before the new quarantine measures were brought in. Travellers returning to or visiting the UK from France, the Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, Turks &amp; Caicos and Aruba after 4am on Saturday will be required to self-isolate for two weeks. We expect to hear more from the Victorian government on the 303 new cases reported earlier this morning, but in the meantime it’s worth noting these figures at least appear to be a sign of a slow downward trend. Over the past five days Victoria recorded 372, 278, 410, 331 and 303 cases respectively. “The seven-day trend indicates the peak was probably four or five days ago and we will continue to see lower numbers overall from here on in,” the state’s chief medical officer Brett Sutton said on Friday. The New Zealand Herald reports that a person who has tested positive for Covid-19 after arriving in Japan had recently visited Rotorua and Taupō in NZ, prompting health officials in the country to warn there was a possibility people may have been infected at two locations: The Wairakei Terraces between 6pm and 7pm on Thursday, 6 August 6 and; Wai-O-Tapu Thermal Wonderland on Friday, 7 August, between 9am and 10.15am New Zealand had appeared to have effectively eliminated the Covid-19 virus, but a new outbreak saw 13 new cases diagnosed in the country on Friday. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has just been talking to Sydney radio station 2GB about the findings of the Ruby Princess inquiry, which cleared federal agencies of wrongdoing in the saga. Morrison said: It is as we said it was. We were being straight with people about what happened and I think the inquiry has borne that out. On the New South Wales health department, which was criticised in the final report for making “serious errors” in handling the debacle, Morrison said it had been “a very difficult time”. Officials will make mistakes in a pandemic that none of us have had to manage before. I think there have been some humble learnings in NSW and I’ve seen NSW go from strength to strength. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic. Here’s how things stand: Australia’s Covid-19 death toll stands at 379 after Victoria reported 303 new cases and four deaths on Saturday. It came after a man in his 20s became the youngest person to die of the virus in Australia on Friday amid the second-wave outbreak in the city of Melbourne. Also on Friday a long-awaited report into the Ruby Princess cruise ship debacle – which saw hundreds of infections spread around the country after the ship was allowed to dock in Sydney despite having infectious patients on board – found the New South Wales Health department made multiple “serious errors”. France has recorded another new post-lockdown record rise in cases, with 2,846 new infections. The UK has removed the country from its travel corridor, meaning all holidaymakers returning from France will have to self-isolate for two weeks, prompting British tourists to scramble to cross the Channel before the cut-off time on Saturday 4am BST. In the UK, the North West, West Yorkshire, East Lancashire and Leicester face a third week under tightened coronavirus restrictions as the latest figures showed no decrease in the number of infections, the Department of Health has said. Germany has declared almost all of Spain as a coronavirus risk region following surging infections – a further blow to the country’s tourism industry. Greece is limiting public gatherings to 50 people amid a recent spike in cases. The measure will be in place until 24 August in areas with high infection numbers. The government has imposed a midnight curfew on bars and restaurants in Athens and other regions. The EU has reached a deal with British company AstraZeneca for at least 300m doses of its vaccine candidate. The deal includes an option to purchase a further 100m doses should the vaccine prove safe and effective. Brazil has reported 50,644 new coronavirus infections and 1,060 new deaths, the health ministry said on Friday. The country’s tally now stands at 3,275,520 confirmed cases and 106,523 deaths, making it second globally in terms of the number of cases and deaths after the US. Croatia recorded 208 new coronavirus cases on Friday, the country’s chief epidemiologist Krunoslav Capak has said. Croatia will require bars and nightclubs to close after midnight for a period of 10 days from this weekend, similarly to Greece.

33	In the heart of the Australian War Memorial hang twin portraits of Ben Roberts-Smith, the most decorated soldier of his time and now its most controversial former special forces warrior. The first of Michael Zavros’s paintings is modestly sized, dignified in composition. Roberts-Smith, 41, stands in full military uniform, gazing intently, tunic breast filled with medals including his Victoria Cross, Australia’s highest honour. It pales beside the other painting, Pistol grip, a monumental 1.6 by 2.2-metre portrait presenting the imposing fighter in special forces fatigues, arms extended in combat pose, hands gripping an invisible handgun, finger on the trigger. Zavros recalled on the AWM website that upon asking Roberts-Smith to adopt a fighting stance, “He went to this whole other mode. He was suddenly this other creature and I immediately saw all these other things. It showed me what he is capable of … it was just there in this flash.” Just as this larger-than-life image of Roberts-Smith looms over the war memorial, the nation’s secular shrine to Anzac, so, too, do investigations into him and other exceptional soldiers cast ominous shadows over Australia’s special forces, including the Special Air Service, the regiment the VC winner served in until 2013 including during six tours of Afghanistan in as many years. Since 2016 Paul Brereton, the Australian defence force inspector general, has been conducting an inquiry into allegations of war crimes by a small number of special forces troops in Afghanistan. Brereton – who is reported to have interviewed some 250 former and serving special forces soldiers – is due to imminently report to the federal government. The government is managing expectations ahead of the release of the Brereton report, warning that it will make for “uncomfortable reading” and could lead to significant structural reform of the special forces. The defence minister, Linda Reynolds, said the regiments had undertaken “a significant amount of self-reflection on how some of these reported circumstances could have happened, and what needs to happen structurally and culturally to make sure that these events do not happen again”. A first step towards an expected major restructure has already been taken with the appointment of former commando Paul Kenny as the new special operations commander – a role usually filled by an ex-SAS officer. Roberts-Smith, now employed as a manager in Queensland for Kerry Stokes’s Seven Network, features in the inspector general’s investigations. It has been reported Roberts-Smith is being investigated by Australian Federal Police in relation to alleged war crimes in Afghanistan. Roberts-Smith has vehemently denied the allegations, reportedly claiming his anonymous accusers were motivated by professional jealousy and personal vendettas. He is also suing former Fairfax newspapers over a series of 2018 articles that he claims defamed him because they portrayed him as someone who “broke the moral and legal rules of military engagement”. He has previously rejected the allegations of misconduct as malicious and deeply troubling. Roberts-Smith’s defamation lawyer, Mark O’Brien, told the Guardian: “My client’s position has not changed. Nothing more to add.” While Roberts-Smith is the highest profile member of Australian special forces in question, allegations of unnecessarily brutal behaviour by other serving and former SAS and commando soldiers in Afghanistan are also being investigated – including for summarily executing, and otherwise abusing, unarmed suspected militants and civilians. The alleged misconduct – which includes SAS members flying the US Confederate flag (with its racist/white supremacist connotations) while on operation – has been exposed in a series of reports over several years by ABC and Nine newspapers journalists. The government may be inclined to keep the inquiry’s findings secret. But it will face immense pressure to release the Brereton report which, by its very necessity, implies the need for dramatic reform of the special forces, which include the SAS and two commando regiments. It is, in the words of one source close to the SAS, “potentially existential” for the regiment based on the British Special Air Service, with which it shares the motto “Who Dares Wins” and the winged dagger emblem. Indeed, some former and serving members of the SAS believe the Brereton inquiry and the police investigations could inspire a special forces restructure, with a focus on the SAS. Sources insist it could even result in the SAS headquarters being moved to the east coast from Swanbourne outside Perth, where it has been since the 1957 establishment of its first company – far from the gaze of Special Operations Command at Bungendore, a continent’s width away just outside Canberra. Some say it might even result in an even more radical restructure – even a renaming – of the regiment. The politicians will decide. And Anzac (central to which is the unqualified political support of its temple, the war memorial) has always had a way of engendering unmatched bipartisan consensus. While individual soldiers are likely to face military and/or civilian charges, both the Brereton inquiry and the police investigations are set to expose serious systemic deficiencies in special forces – especially SAS – chains of command and structure. Questions are already being raised about the unnecessarily high number of rotations some soldiers and officers have undertaken and continue to undertake, and the willingness of successive governments to deploy large numbers of SAS and commando troops to remote US-led wars where regular infantry troops would have sufficed. So, how did the Australian special forces – and especially the revered SAS – end up in this potentially existential crisis? ‘Heat of combat under the fog of war’ The unpalatable reality of how Australia’s most skilled soldiers have sometimes conducted themselves, from the Boer war to contemporary operations in Afghanistan, has always contradicted the well-cultivated myth of the white-hatted Aussie-Anzac “digger”. No element of our military has been more mythologised, praised or mystified than the SAS. This helps explain why, as investigations into alleged special forces war crimes in Afghanistan culminate, the guardians of Anzac myth have criticised so rancorously those exposing such purported grave misconduct. The former war memorial director and defence minister Brendan Nelson, the one-time prime minister Tony Abbott and Stokes – Roberts-Smith’s employer, chair of the memorial’s council and a generous bankroller of AWM exhibitions, who has purchased and donated numerous Victoria Cross medals to the institution – have all supported with deeds and words Roberts-Smith and the SAS in these times of controversy. Abbott told the Australian newspaper people should be cautious to “judge soldiers operating in the heat of combat under the fog of war by the same standards that we would judge civilians”. Nelson strongly backed Roberts-Smith, insisting some allegations by journalists about him were an attempt to “tear down our heroes”. “I am very concerned that if the media pursuit of Ben Roberts-Smith and others continues … we run the risk of becoming a people unworthy of such sacrifice,” he said. He insisted he didn’t “doubt that what you and I might think, in the cold, hard light of day, that bad things have happened. War is a messy business. “But as far as I am concerned, unless there have been the most egregious breaches of laws of armed conflict, we should leave it all alone.” Stokes has supported Roberts-Smith’s long, costly defamation action against Nine newspapers, which has included the engagement of a public relations firm whose own award-winning investigative journalist has dissected the journalistic methodology behind the allegations against the VC winner. The SAS is revered. But despite the views of some prominent boosters who seem to suggest its alleged misdeeds would best remain shrouded in the fog of war, it is not sacrosanct or beyond reproach. Exemplifying what can happen when elements of an elite unit go bad is the 1993 “Somalia affair” during which rogue members of Canada’s Airborne Regiment unlawfully killed people while deployed in Somalia. The regiment was abolished. The adjectives “secretive” and “elite” have always preceded most mentions of the SAS, revered globally as “the best of the best” since its first deployment to Borneo during the “confrontasi” with Indonesia in 1965. Based on the British SAS and with its genesis in the combat experiences of Australia’s world war two M and Z special units, the independent commando companies and the Coastwatchers, the Australian SAS was designed to carry out long-range covert intelligence, reconnaissance and strike operations in small teams, often behind enemy lines. It also has a major domestic counter-terrorism function. The SAS has enjoyed a standout reputation for ingenuity, ruthless efficiency, bravery and discipline for its operations in Borneo, Vietnam, Somalia, Timor-Leste, Iraq and Afghanistan – and on numerous peacekeeping deployments. Reflecting its international reputation, the then commander of the US Marine Corp, Jim Mattis, who fought alongside the SAS in Afghanistan from 2001, wrote to the regimental commander, Gus Gilmore, “We Marines would happily storm hell itself with your troops on our right flank.” ‘Sickened, disgusted and really very angry’ Serving and former special forces soldiers are part of an exclusive brethren. Present and past soldiers don’t much talk about what they’ve done – except to each other. Many remain in close contact and continue to have insight into current operations and command efficacy. One former senior SAS member said he had first heard allegations about serious misconduct in 2009 or 2010. “Unfortunately, it has been known for a very long time that these allegations were around,” he said. “Everyone with any association with the regiment has heard about them and questions were being raised long before any of this made the media. “So, with BRS you have to remember that Betty Windsor has pinned it on this guy’s chest [the Queen’s representative, then governor general Quentin Bryce, presented the Victoria Cross to Roberts-Smith in 2011]. If it’s got to be un-pinned the shame to the regiment will be significant … many are mindful of what happened to the [Canadian] Airborne. It’s possible that the regiment could be restructured or more as a consequence of all of this.” Jim Truscott is a former special forces officer who served in the SAS and commando regiments. He says regimental alumnae are “sickened, disgusted and really very angry that this very long delay in the release of the report has been allowed to happen”. “What would appear to have happened is a breakdown in the chain of command,” says Truscott, 64. “And while on the surface it might seem like an individual or individuals have done something wrong, or potentially done something wrong, the system should have known about it. “And the system should have known about it very quickly and something should have been done about it, right there and then. And the fact that this has taken … many years to bubble up is an anathema to me.” Truscott questions if the traditional routine procedure of the “hot debrief” was carried out after all SAS patrols and combat operations in Afghanistan in the relevant period – the decade from about 2005. “That was so important because what that would immediately do is identify deficiencies. It wasn’t just to glean intelligence … it was to expose if you stuffed up. How are you going to stop the stuff-up from happening again, you know?” Truscott agrees one possibility is that alleged bad behaviour was known about at senior levels – and perhaps even in government – but nothing was done about it. “And if that’s the case how far up the chair of command was it hidden? Was it an act of commission or omission? We don’t know. All I’m saying is that the debriefing procedure almost certainly has broken down because this thing should’ve been fixed right at the start. “The fact no one has done anything about it is a travesty. Perhaps the fault lies in the chain of command, not with individuals. If indeed something wrong has happened.” In 2001 the SAS was deployed in a highly politicised military operation – the seizing of the MV Tampa, a Norwegian freighter. The ship carrying hundreds of asylum seekers, rescued from a stranded fishing boat in the Indian Ocean, was attempting to bring them to Australia. The SAS, on the order of the then prime minister, John Howard, seized the vessel – an illustration, on the eve of a federal election, that his government was serious about border control. The scandal now engulfing Australia’s special forces has an equally, though perhaps less obvious, political genesis. Since the first gulf war in 1990 through to this century’s repeated operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, Australian special forces have been the answer when the US has called for Australian boots on the ground. The SAS is in a constant high state of readiness (one of the commando regiments, in contrast, comprises, in part, reservists) and its personnel are Australia’s most highly trained soldiers, their efficiency and lethality unparalleled. Australian prime ministers from both major parties have operated on a premise they would experience greater electoral pain associated with high battlefield fatalities if they deployed regular infantry instead of special forces, especially SAS. The special forces are not easily killed. But a combination of high rotation (some SAS members and commandos deployed up to eight times over periods of several years), leadership shortcomings at regimental headquarters and the over-deployment of senior commanders who ought to have remained on base is alleged by some to have led to the erosion of the SAS’s disciplinary culture. The SAS ethos is founded on independent thinking, rigorous self-discipline and post enemy-contact debriefing where, rank regardless, men would openly discuss – and criticise without repercussion – suboptimal operational aspects. There is little adherence to the strictures of formal military custom; first names are used without deference to rank, the rules on hair (including facial hair), uniform and kit are relaxed. It is possible, sources say, regimental recruits have mistaken a laissez-faire approach to military protocol as licence for individual ill-discipline that is antithetical to traditional regimental self-regulation. Sources say SAS command has been “diluted” by the promotion of too many officers to other roles outside the regiment. Too many warrant officers, meanwhile, have been promoted to officers from within the ranks, resulting in a diminution of the non-commissioned officers corps and potential misunderstanding among newer personnel of traditional unit culture. In a high-rotation environment in Afghanistan, the SAS and commando regiments also sometimes found themselves effectively “competing for work”. “I’ve served in both [SAS and commando] units and it’s a travesty that such tribalism has arisen,” Truscott says. “It’s just possible … that the tribalism was so great that it was like ultra-competition in sport, you know? When elite sports people get to that level, competition is so fierce to stay in front that bad things happen. “You have an alpha-type personality prevailing through that regiment. It needs to be very carefully controlled. What we are seeing and hearing right now possibly points to a dramatic failure of individual self-discipline and command.” A former SAS officer says, “Blame is easy to attribute to tactical elements involved in the most complex combat environment [in Afghanistan] that Australians have faced in decades. Nonetheless, the regiment has much to answer for– a lack of leadership, foresight, immaturity and just plain common sense has led to this deplorable state of events. All that at a local level – but exacerbated by more serious problems at senior levels inclusive of successive governments of both persuasions that have cheerfully prostituted our country to the requests of the US and to a lesser degree a motley collection of allies referred to as ‘the coalition of the willing’ – all that at the self-import of playing on the international stage.” John Blaxland, professor of international security and intelligence studies at Australian National University and a former army intelligence officer, says it is “imperative we get to the truth about what happened”. “Australians have been justifiably proud of their defence force exactly because they set and maintain exemplary standards,” Blaxland says. “For the part of society tasked and mandated to conduct lethal acts, the absolute highest standards have to be set, maintained and seen to be maintained. The moral authority of the ADF is on the line. “Beyond this, the worst aspects need to be seen in the context of a long war, with insufficiently defined objectives, where we, as a nation, demanded too much of too few – notably our special forces. We over-relied on them, sending them time and time again. Is it any wonder that, with unclear strategic objectives set for Australia’s Afghanistan mission and shifting operational plans, year in and year out in the same bloody province, that somehow some of the special forces lost the bearings on their moral compass? We as a society need to be held to account for this and not just the special forces members involved. We allowed this to happen.” Blaxland identifies an “understandable emotional pull” for public figures invested in supporting the Australian military, in particular the special forces, but says “now is not the time to unquestioningly defend any and all their actions”. “Extreme human behaviour, involving the killing of unarmed and detained individuals, flies in the face of the ethics and values instilled in our society and upheld, with few exceptions, by the ADF. To be sure, our adversary did such things and much worse. They set a very low bar. But we expect our soldiers to act differently, as ambassadors for a liberal open democratic society, prepared to use lethal force, but only when necessary, when authorised and in a manner proportional to the circumstances, without overkill.” Much of the cultural and political backlash to Nine’s and the ABC’s investigatons into the special forces are freighted with implied suggestions that elite soldiers are somehow above the law and that transgressions ought to be overlooked. In his 2005 book, The Amazing SAS, the bestselling author and former News Corp defence correspondent Ian McPhedran warned of the risks of over-deploying the regiment. The challenge of ensuring justice where national heroes are involved, he says, “rests with the politicians who send them to war and the generals who are ultimately responsible for their behaviour”. “Too often with our defence force we have seen mid-ranking officers or diggers take the fall for the systemic failures of those at the top. This is a key factor in the current situation,” McPhedran says. “It is these same politicians and generals who will decide what the public will be allowed to know [about the Brereton report]. “I would caution those blindly defending the special forces and their high-profile heroes to tread warily given the video evidence of egregious war crimes that has come to light. It has nothing to do with tearing down heroes as there is simply no excuse for cold-blooded murder under any circumstances. It is now clear that such crimes were committed by Australian soldiers more than once in Afghanistan.” Defence did not specifically address a series of Guardian Australia questions relating to the conduct, chain-of-command issues and potential restructure of Australian special forces raised in this article. “The Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force (IGADF) is conducting an Inquiry into rumours and allegations relating to the conduct of Australia’s Special Operations Task Group in Afghanistan over the period 2005 to 2016,” a defence spokesperson said. “On completion, the IGADF [inspector general] will release the Inquiry report to the Chief of the Defence Force, who will consider its findings and determine appropriate actions. “Until this time and in order to protect the integrity and independence of the Inquiry, and the reputation of individuals involved, it is not appropriate for Defence to comment further.” The Australian special forces are as steeped in mythology as Australia’s early troops, the Colonial Bushmen, who fought in various British units in the Boer war, and eventually evolved into the Light Horse regiments of world war one. The SAS and the commandos, meanwhile, have their Australian genesis in the independent companies that fought behind Japanese lines in the Pacific during world war two. All were mired in controversy that shocked the Australian polity and public, starting with the conviction and execution of the Australian lieutenants Harry “Breaker” Morant and Peter Handcock for murdering Boer civilians and prisoners of war. In 1918 Australian light horsemen took part in the massacre of dozens of Arab men and boys in the Palestinian village of Surafend and at a nearby Bedouin camp. There have been persistent suggestions that after the Japanese surrender 75 years ago this month Australian soldiers, some belonging to the independent companies, summarily executed and otherwise mistreated prisoners in Borneo and New Guinea. Such truths clash with Australia’s nurtured Anzac myths encompassing loss, sacrifice, mateship, endurance and egalitarianism. Australia has never liked to scrutinise the human impact of the wars it fights, and the capacity for combat to impel soldiers – otherwise good men – to commit immoral, inhumane acts. There is little in the war memorial, over which the presence of Ben Roberts-Smith VC looms so large, that details such stories. Why? Because the simple trope of Anzac mythology is heroism, whereas the brutal reality of war fighting is complex and ugly.

34	You failed. No matter. Fail again. Fail in pretty much exactly the same way. How many times, Pep, how many times? The idea that Pep Guardiola overcomplicates knockout games has become such a truism it seems impossible a manager of such clarity of thought could still be following that pattern; still finding ways to insert his own anxieties, his maniacal intellectualism into the fine details of elite knockout football. And yet, here we are once again. Hello tactical confusion, my old friend. On a thrilling, frantic night in Lisbon Pep Guardiola picked a Manchester City team to play an entirely un-Manchester City game, straightjacketing this pass-and-move machine into a strangely muted shape, apparently with the aim of mirroring the three-man defence of Lyon, the seventh best team in France. To put this in its simplest form: by the 50th minute in the Estádio José Alvalade, João Cancelo, Kyle Walker, Rodri, Fernandinho and Ilkay Gündogan had touched the ball 288 times. Riyad Mahrez, Bernardo Silva, Phil Foden and David Silva had touched the ball zero times. And City had spent more than half of this eventual 3-1 defeat crouched behind a mannered defensive guard. Kyle Walker as a bespoke man-marking wing-back-cum creative overlapper? Is this really a good idea right now? Certainly Walker gave it a go, haring up and down, whirling into unmapped spaces, a man doing an impressively intense free-running parkour circuit while all around him a Champions League tie was taking place. Elsewhere, the manager who loves midfielders gave us surely one of the drabbest midfields of his entire career. For 60 minutes City shuttled from side to side. Kevin De Bruyne, the great creative talent of the Premier League, struggled to find space. Why do this? Why suck out the joy and the freedom just when it was needed most? For these players it must have felt like being invited to perform your triumphant new No 1 hit single, and deciding en route to the studios to go with the 10-minute jazz odyssey instead. We came in search of that sublime expressive entity of the last two years. Instead we got an hour of nose flute and drum solos. Guardiola was predictably unpredictable from the start, opting for a back three, with his squad’s three main holding midfielders starting either in or in front of the defence. No doubt City were concerned about Lyon’s mobility in midfield and their intelligent forward surges. In the event they forgot to bring their own quiver of arrows, as for 20 minutes the team that always goes forward barely mustered an attack. Then Lyon scored. It came from a knot in that City backline, as Walker lingered in an empty space, playing Karl Toko Ekambi onside. A saving tackle sent the loose ball towards Maxwel Cornet, who finished brilliantly. City’s players worked hard. De Bruyne was prominent, albeit strapped into a stilted system. On his touchline Rudi Garcia looked puzzled, man trying not to make too much noise for fear of breaking the spell. For an hour his team had been asked to do nothing different, to perform only within their comfort zone. When, you wondered, would Garcia be forced into some uncomfortable contortion by the super-brain in the opposite corner? What was this? A rope-a-dope? Eventually Mahrez came on for Fernandinho and an equaliser was a more familiar kind of City moment. Mahrez eased Raheem Sterling in down the left. His fine pullback was struck firmly into the corner by De Bruyne. And yet from there it was Garcia who won the in-game flow of move and counter-move, bringing on Moussa Dembélé and pressing his team forward when they might have been swamped. There were some details that could have changed the narrative. Lyon’s second goal was, arguably, awarded within the rules. But it still stank. First Ekambi received a pass from Houssem Aouar in an offside position. He jumped over the ball, which counts as a non-involvement, a point of view that confounds any kind of good sense. In the meantime Aymeric Laporte was sent sprawling by a collision with Dembélé, who ran on and scored. No foul was given. Then, with four minutes left, Sterling missed an extraordinary open goal from eight yards out with the tie there to be revived. Within a minute it was decisively dead as Dembélé tapped home at the other end. Afterwards Guardiola seemed a little vague, perhaps even a tiny bit relieved to escape this weird, distended season. Either way, defeat makes it three in four quarter-finals for City, and a decade without a Champions League final for the most revered club coach of the age. Perhaps one of these days Guardiola will overthink a European knockout game so hard that he’ll accidentally play his normal team and win it. The great shame is that City exited without having ever quite been themselves, and without ever expressing their finer qualities. And once again Guardiola had blinked with the line in sight.
35	At this point in history, time does not appear to have been especially kind to the views of the famed economist Milton Friedman. He may be one of the few recipients of the Nobel memorial prize in economic sciences that non-dismal scientists can actually name (others might be Friedrich Hayek, Joseph Stiglitz, Paul Krugman and, ahem, President Josiah Bartlet from The West Wing) but one of his most famous ideas is looking somewhat dated. In 1970, Friedman memorably wrote in a New York Times article that businesses existed purely to make money for shareholders, and that executives drivelling on about being “socially responsible” were “preaching pure and unadulterated socialism”. It was powerful stuff, which basically set the tone for US capitalism for 50 years. But it seems slightly less powerful now. Almost exactly a year ago, some of the highest-paid executives on the planet appeared to ditch Friedman’s idea of shareholder primacy as they attempted to convince their publics that they thought customers, employees, suppliers and communities might matter a little bit too. And this week will see another small landmark for that resistance, with the full-year results of the major miner BHP. The event will be notable as it showcases the performance of a company that, despite being one of the largest on the London Stock Exchange, can no longer boast of having the UK’s largest pension fund on its shareholder register. The government-backed National Employment Savings Trust (Nest), which, with 9 million members, is the most popular pension fund in the country, is divesting from fossil fuels in what climate campaigners have hailed as a landmark move for the industry. The self-imposed ban on holding such shares means that some of the world’s biggest mining companies, such as BHP, cannot be part of Nest’s future holdings, at least as long they derive profits from mining coal. This month, Nest sold its final BHP share. Friedman would have probably been pretty cross about all that, not least because what really got him grinding his teeth were business executives believing that they were “defending free enterprise” while also “promoting desirable ‘social’ ends”. Fifty years on, that is precisely what the promoters seem to be doing. Nest says that it is “looking purely at the investment case” and that “climate change risk is investment risk”, with shareholders possibly finding themselves stranded with assets that turn out to be worthless if they are reliant on burning fossil fuels. The Bank of England has said that as much as $20 trillion (£16tn) of assets could be wiped out by the climate crisis if it is not effectively addressed. Meanwhile, folk who like to study these things will tell you that there is no evidence that buying ethical shares makes any difference to financial performance. They point you to the FTSE4Good – the City’s version of an ethical index – which pretty well matches the returns of the FTSE All Share. And yet the ghost of Friedman might say this reasoning is flawed, and that they would be better to stick with the do-gooder argument. If you compare the performance of FTSE4Good with, say, BHP shares, it would not just be a grizzled old economist who’d prefer to have the miner’s stock in their pension pot. Equally, one might wonder if the FTSE4Good is really so angelic a punt. Its 13th most significant stock just happens to be, er … BHP.

37	Is Palace Pier the real deal? He carries a heavy responsibility on Sunday, having lured Frankie Dettori into giving up the Ebor meeting to ride him in the Prix Jacques le Marois, for which he is the hot favourite. He might be the only hot thing in Deauville, as the forecast temperature looks pretty ordinary for August and the rain will continue during Sunday’s action. It will be a very different surface to any Palace Pier has encountered and will blunt his pace. Only with trepidation can we oppose any classy, unbeaten colt representing the Gosden / Dettori partnership. But a one-length win over Pinatubo and Wichita is not irresistible form. I was tempted by Persian King, whose French Guineas win was on soft, but the balance of his form gets less impressive with probing. Instead, the pairing of Circus Maximus (2.50) and Christophe Soumillon is one to fire the imagination at 5-1 or bigger. Circus Maximus is always vulnerable to a turn of foot like the one shown by Mohaather at Goodwood, but he ran well in defeat there. Ground like this gives him a chance of outbattling his rivals, as he has done in three other Group Ones, and he should give us a run in the Marois, to be shown on Sky Sports Racing. 1.50 Newbury Having shown his ability to cope with this sort of ground at Haydock, Risk Taker looks the answer in the first of seven races on ITV4. Clive Cox’s chestnut appears to have started in handicaps on a lenient rating. 2.05 Ripon Now back to the mark from which he won this last year, Hortzadar has been knocking on the door and the useful claimer Sean Kirrane may be able to get him over the line. 2.25 Newbury From the Owen Burrows yard now enjoying an unprecedented period of hotness, Danyah was a tidy winner on his handicap debut and has been given time to progress. 2.40 Ripon Fountain Cross is talented but might lack the raw pace of Internationaldream, third at a big price in the Molecomb. 3.00 Newbury Jim Crowley is back in Baasem’s saddle for the first time since he was winning last summer and it might be worth giving him another chance at 8-1 or so, now that he’s back on muddy ground. 3.15 Ripon Available at 33-1 in places, Deputise is not certain to love a big-field test like this but looks well treated on the lowest mark he’s had since his juvenile days. He fared very respectably in a couple of all-weather spins in the spring after joining Michael Wigham and excuses were available for a couple of the flops at the end of his time with William Haggas. His new trainer will surely get him winning at some point. 3.35 Newbury There’s a lot to like about the progress Miss Jingles has been making and the Goodwood winner is surely up to Listed level. This ground might not be perfect for her but that also seems true of her most significant rivals. Trial return of racecourse bookmakers from Tuesday Bookmakers will return to British racecourses on Tuesday for the first time since March in a two-week trial intended to establish whether they can trade safely under Covid‑19 restrictions. Limited numbers of bookmakers will be allowed at tracks, taking business only from racehorse owners. “We’re going to trial it to see if it works,” said Paul Swain of the Racecourse Association. “After two weeks, we can either extend it, change it or stop it.” Although cards are the preferred method of transaction, bookmakers will be allowed to accept cash, in contrast to the Goodwood trial that was abandoned at a late stage a fortnight ago. “It’s a bit of a buzz out of the blue,” said the veteran bookie Joe Huddlestone, who, along with Keith Johnson, will be allowed to take bets during York’s Ebor meeting that starts on Wednesday. “I’m not thinking my finances are going to change overnight. “I haven’t missed an Ebor meeting in over 40 years and, funnily enough, I was saying to my wife that we’ve got kind of used to not going racing but it would really hit home if they’d had Ebor week without us. And lo and behold, now we’re going.” Racecourse bookmakers have fretted about being the sport’s forgotten sector since racing professionals returned to action in June. They fear the world is moving on without them, as punters open online betting accounts and become accustomed to starting prices derived from high street firms rather than on-course trade. As many as six bookmakers may be able to trade at Musselburgh a week on Wednesday, if the track gets the green light to test the return of spectators. It is understood the venue has asked the Scottish government to allow a crowd of 600 to attend. If approved, it would become the first trial of a crowd at a racecourse, a fortnight before the Doncaster St Leger meeting, which has already been named as a likely pilot event. Organisers are said to be putting the finishing touches to their operational plan.

41	We’ve launched a new global coronavirus blog at the link below – head there for the latest: The Treasury is reviewing a “radical” proposal for a new state-owned body that would manage £35bn of toxic coronavirus debt and help save up to 780,000 British businesses. A City taskforce, the Recapitalisation Group, led by EY and the lobby group TheCityUK, is recommending that a government-owned UK Recovery Corporation be established to handle a growing pile of unsustainable government-backed debt that could otherwise wipe out thousands of businesses and lead to 3 million job losses: Hi, Helen Sullivan joining you now. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com. Brazil has suffered 1,233 more deaths and registered 39,924 new cases, its health ministry has said. The country has now recorded a total off 75,366 deaths and confirmed 1,996,748 cases in all, making it the world’s second worst-affected. As the figures were released, the far-right president, who has repeatedly dismissed the dangers posed by the pandemic, publicly acknowledged a second positive test that suggests he has not recovered. Bolsonaro told reporters he would get tested again in a few days. He continued to play down the country’s mounting death toll and said his good physical condition would prevent him from developing serious symptoms if he got ill. Bolsonaro has also sidelined medical experts in Brazil’s handling of the pandemic, pushed back against state and city lockdowns and circulated often in public without a mask, drawing criticism from public health specialists. He has also said he was taking the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, an unproven Covid-19 treatment that he and Trump have touted as a remedy. Bolsonaro’s pressure to use the drug alienated two health ministers who resigned in the middle of the pandemic. The ministry is being led on an interim basis by an active duty army general. Scotland could ask people arriving from England to quarantine, its first minister Nicola Sturgeon has said. In an interview with ITV’s Peston programme due to be broadcast in the next couple of hours, she has said: Scotland would have the ability through public health measures to ask people to quarantine if they came to Scotland. And I’ve said, again, this is not political, it is not constitutional, I’m taking these decisions purely from a public health perspective. We do see prevalence of the virus at a lower level at the moment – although we’re not complacent – than we do in England. But that’s not something I want to do if we can avoid that. I think the first thing we want to do is work very constructively as we do already with authorities in England to look at good outbreak management and where that requires localised travel restrictions, then rely on that in the first instance. But I’m not going to shy away from doing anything that I think is necessary and appropriate and effective in protecting people in Scotland from a virus that we know now to our painful cost can take life and also as we are increasingly learning can do a lot of long-term health damage to people. Discussing Scotland’s differing approach to England’s easing of lockdown measures, she said: Well, my calculation is that if we are more successful in driving the virus to very low levels, getting as close as possible to elimination of it before a potential second wave in the autumn and winter, then we will build ourselves a much more sustainable foundation for economic recovery. So, the judgement is that taking a couple of weeks, and that’s pretty much what we’re talking about here, longer to come out of lockdown, if that buys us a more sustainable recovery in the medium to long term, then that’s the right thing to do. And Sturgeon celebrated the lifting of some of the restrictions in Scotland: Here are the latest developments: Magaluf is closing its party strip of Punta Ballena after footage of drunken British tourists flouting regulations about wearing masks and social distancing while dancing on cars prompted an outcry. The Balearic Islands’ tourism minister also announced the closure of two other notorious party strips. Ireland delayed the easing of lockdown measures and introduced a requirement that face coverings be worn in shops. The taoiseach Micheál Martin said the pause was disappointing, but necessary. A war of words between Trump allies and the White House’s top infectious disease expert continued. Dr Anthony Fauci said he could not understand efforts by some to discredit him, though the US president himself rebuked his own aide over the criticism. Spain has recorded 390 new coronavirus cases over the past 24 hours - the highest single-day figure since 22 May. Most of the new cases are in the northeastern regions of Aragón and Catalonia. The US has seen 67,000 cases in a single day – the highest number in 24 hours so far, according to the John Hopkins university of medicine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put the figure at 60,971. Iran said today that 140 of its health workers had died of coronavirus and 5,000 have been infected. Amnesty International has estimated that more than 3,000 health workers have died globally, although it says the figure is likely to be a significant underestimate. The Irish government has postponed the scheduled reopening of pubs, due to happen on Monday, until 10 August because of a spike in coronavirus cases. The Irish Independent also reported that the cabinet is expected to recommend that face coverings become mandatory in inside settings and that foreign travel be discouraged. Levels of childhood immunisations against dangerous diseases such as measles, tetanus and diphtheria have dropped alarmingly during the Covid-19 pandemic, putting millions of children at risk, United Nations agencies have warned. The European commission said today that European Union states should bring forward vaccinations against flu to the summer to reduce the risk of simultaneous influenza and Covid-19 outbreaks in the autumn. It also urged states to increase the number of people vaccinated. Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, is making face coverings mandatory for shoppers in all its stores from Monday. It said that about 65% of its more than 5,000 stores and clubs are located in areas where there is already some form of government mandate on face coverings and by making it compulsory in all outlets it will bring consistency. South Africa’s caseload has exceeded 300,000, the greatest national figure on the continent and among the top 10 in the world. The nation recorded a rise of 12,757 cases on Wednesday to reach 311,049, its health ministry said a little more than four months since the first case was found. It has tested 2,278,127 people so far and has seen a total of 160,693 recoveries and 4,453 deaths. Brazil’s president Jair Bolsonaro has again tested positive, according to CNN Brasil, suggesting the far-right leader has yet to recover from his initial diagnosis announced a week ago. Since becoming ill, Bolsonaro has said he remains in good health and earlier this week said he would resume his normal work schedule if he tested negative. Here’s a little more on that announcement from Martin, who has said: One thing has not changed, this virus has not changed. Indiscriminate in its cruelty and relentless as ever in finding new hosts so it can continue to spread ... I know some of the steps I’m announcing this evening will come as a disappointment to some. But we care for our families, we care for our neighbours, we care for our communities. Ireland is to delay the reopening of all pubs until 10 August, the taoiseach Micheál Martin has confirmed. Plans to increase the numbers who can gather both indoors and out were also postponed amid warnings about clusters of infection. The wearing of face coverings will be made compulsory in shops and other indoor public spaces. Plans to roll out phase four of the emergence from lockdown have been put on hold. Martin said: It will be understood for what it is. Protection of the progress, the undoubted progress we have made to date ... It is the right thing to do – to press the pause button. It is very disappointing for publicans in particular. Martin said unrestricted house parties had been linked to recent outbreaks. The acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said: It is a pause. Compared to many countries around the world we are still in a good position. The challenge is to maintain that good position and ensure that the good work over many months is not lost. The number of deaths in France rose by 91 from Monday to stand at 30,120, the country’s health department has said. There was no count for Tuesday, which was a national holiday. The Health Ministry said the number of people in hospital with Covid-19 fell to 6,915 from 6,983 on 13 July, continuing a weeks-long downward trend. The number of people in intensive care units was down to 482 from 492. The US president Donald Trump has issued a rare rebuke of his senior adviser Peter Navarro, saying he should not have written the scathing USA Today opinion piece about Dr Fauci. Navarro, a trade adviser who at times has expanded his reach within the Trump White House, wrote: Dr Anthony Fauci has a good bedside manner with the public, but he has been wrong about everything I have interacted with him on. The initial lack of a pushback from the White House for the article fed a belief that Navarro’s article was supported at the top levels of the White House. But, departing for a trip to Atlanta, Trump was asked whether Navarro had gone rogue. Well, he made a statement representing himself. He shouldn’t be doing that. No, I have a very good relationship with Anthony. A White House official told Reuters that Trump did not endorse Navarro’s article and that Navarro was told “explicitly in recent days to de-escalate the situation”. The official said that White House chief of staff Mark Meadows felt Navarro’s article was “unacceptable”. In the US, the top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci has said he cannot not understand the effort by some in the White House to discredit him, calling it a mistake. In an interview with The Atlantic, he has said: You know, it is a bit bizarre. I don’t really fully understand it. I think if you talk to reasonable people in the White House they realise that was a major mistake on their part because it doesn’t do anything but reflect poorly on them. And I don’t think that was their intention. Here are the latest developments: Magaluf is closing its party strip of Punta Ballena after footage of drunken British tourists flouting regulations about wearing masks and social distancing while dancing on cars prompted an outcry. The Balearic Islands’ tourism minister also announced the closure of two other notorious party strips. Spain has recorded 390 new coronavirus cases over the past 24 hours - the highest single-day figure since 22 May. Most of the new cases are in the northeastern regions of Aragón and Catalonia. The US has seen 67,000 cases in a single day – the highest number in 24 hours so far, according to the John Hopkins university of medicine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put the figure at 60,971. Iran said today that 140 of its health workers had died of coronavirus and 5,000 have been infected. Amnesty International has estimated that more than 3,000 health workers have died globally, although it says the figure is likely to be a significant underestimate. The Irish government has postponed the scheduled reopening of pubs, due to happen on Monday, until 10 August because of a spike in coronavirus cases. The Irish Independent also reported that the cabinet is expected to recommend that face coverings become mandatory in inside settings and that foreign travel be discouraged. Levels of childhood immunisations against dangerous diseases such as measles, tetanus and diphtheria have dropped alarmingly during the Covid-19 pandemic, putting millions of children at risk, United Nations agencies have warned. The European commission said today that European Union states should bring forward vaccinations against flu to the summer to reduce the risk of simultaneous influenza and Covid-19 outbreaks in the autumn. It also urged states to increase the number of people vaccinated. Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, is making face coverings mandatory for shoppers in all its stores from Monday. It said that about 65% of its more than 5,000 stores and clubs are located in areas where there is already some form of government mandate on face coverings and by making it compulsory in all outlets it will bring consistency. The US has suffered 773 more deaths and registered 60,971 new cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has said. That takes the respective totals to 135,991 and 3,416,428. A Bangladesh hospital owner accused of issuing thousands of fake negative coronavirus test results to patients at his two clinics was arrested today while trying to fleeing to India in a burqa, police said.From AFP: The arrest marked the end of a nine-day manhunt for Mohammad Shahed over allegations of giving fake certificates to patients saying they were virus-free without even testing them. Shahed, 42, was one of more than a dozen people detained by authorities over the past few days in connection with the scam. Experts warn the false documents has worsened the already dire virus situation in the country of 168 million people by casting doubt about the veracity of certificates issued by clinics. Rapid Action Battalion spokesman Colonel Ashique Billah told AFP: He was arrested from the bank of a border river as he was trying to flee to India. He was wearing a burqa. His hospitals carried out 10,500 coronavirus tests, out of which 4,200 were genuine and the rest, 6,300 test reports, were given without conducting tests. Shahed is also accused of charging for the certificates and virus treatments even though he had agreed with the government that his hospitals in the capital Dhaka would provide free care. A well-known doctor and her husband were also arrested by police and accused of issuing thousands of fake virus certificates at their Dhaka laboratory. The alleged scams could badly hurt migrant workers seeking to go abroad and whose remittances are key to Bangladesh’s economy, said Shakirul Islam of migrant rights group OKUP. Italy last week suspended flights to Rome from Bangladesh to stem the spate of coronavirus cases within the community after several passengers arriving from Dhaka had tested positive for Covid-19. Islam claimed. Islam said: Some of the Bangladeshis who were tested positive in Italy were allegedly carrying negative Covid certificates from Bangladesh. The government must ensure quality of Covid-19 tests in local laboratories for the sake of its overseas job market. Nearly $19 billion was sent back to Bangladesh by an estimated 12 million migrant workers last year, according to the central bank. Bangladesh has reported just over 193,000 infections and 2,457 deaths so far. But medical experts say the real figures are likely much higher because so little testing has been carried out. The impoverished country has restarted economic activities after lifting a months-long virus lockdown at the end of May, even as the number of cases continues to rise. Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte is enforcing partial coronavirus restrictions in the capital, Manila, for another two weeks, and warned that stricter curbs would be reinstated if the rise in new cases and deaths does not slow down, Reuters reports. The Philippines this week recorded Southeast Asia’s biggest daily jump in coronavirus deaths and saw hospital occupancy grow sharply, after a tripling of infections since a tough lockdown was eased on 1 June to allow more movement and commerce. Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said today. It was clear during our discussion that if the spread of the virus in Manila will not slow, it is possible that stricter quarantine measures would be reimposed after two weeks. Confirmed cases in the capital region have more than doubled to 29,015 since June. Schools are to remain closed, operations of shopping malls and dine-in eateries limited, mass gatherings banned, social distancing enforced on public transport, and children and the elderly urged to stay at home. Under tighter regulations in force from mid-March to the end of May, public transport was barred, working from home instituted where possible, and only one person per household allowed out for essential goods. Duterte eased lockdown measures in Cebu from tomorrow after the central city recorded a decline in the number of confirmed cases, although it still accounted for 10% of the 58,850 total infections in the country. Navotas, a city of 250,000 in the National Capital Region surrounding Manila, will return to lockdown from tomorrow after cases tripled since June, its mayor said this week. Health Secretary Francisco Duque said earlier today the government had “successfully flattened the curve since April” because Covid-19 cases were growing slower, with the rate of doubling of infections now at 8.28 days from 4.8 days in May. To prevent wider transmission, the government said it would use police to carry out house-to-house searches for patients so they can be isolated and brought to quarantine facilities where they can be properly managed. The Irish government has postponed the scheduled reopening of pubs, due to happen on Monday, until 10 August because of a spike in coronavirus cases, the Irish Independent reports. The report says the cabinet is also expected to recommend that face coverings become mandatory in inside settings and that foreign travel be discouraged. Spain has recorded 390 new coronavirus cases over the past 24 hours - the highest single-day figure since 22 May. Most of the new cases are in the northeastern regions of Aragón and Catalonia. To date, the country has confirmed 257,494 cases of the disease and 28,413 deaths, according to figures from the health ministry. On Wednesday the health minister, Salvador Illa, said there were 171 small outbreaks across the country, of which 120 were active. A Republican governor who has backed one of the US’s most aggressive reopening plans, resisted any statewide mandate on masks and who rarely wears one himself, has tested positive for coronavirus, AP reports. Kevin Stitt said he is isolating at home, the news agency reports. Stitt, a first-term governor, attended President Donald Trump’s rally in Tulsa last month, which health experts have said likely contributed to a surge in coronavirus cases there. Oklahoma has seen a dramatic increase in the number of people testing positive for Covid-19, with nearly 22,000 confirmed positive cases in the state and 428 total deaths. One of Stitt’s cabinet members, David Ostrowe, tested positive for coronavirus in March. Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, is making face coverings mandatory for shoppers in all its stores from Monday. It comes as the US recorded another new high number of daily cases (67,000). The directive applies to Walmart stores as well as its wholesale Sam’s Club outlets. The retailer said that about 65% of its more than 5,000 stores and clubs are located in areas where there is already some form of government mandate on face coverings and by making it compulsory in all outlets it will bring consistency. Walmart said staff posted near the entrance to stores will remind people of the requirement and “will work with customers who show up at a store without a face covering to try and find a solution”. It added: We know it may not be possible for everyone to wear a face covering. Our associates will be trained on those exceptions to help reduce friction for the shopper and make the process as easy as possible for everyone. As we have seen in states and municipalities with mask mandates, virtually everyone either brings a mask or readily complies with the requirement, and we anticipate that to happen in other areas as well. Day one of direct flights from the UK to Greece has got off to what some are calling an inauspicious start. No sooner had the first air links commenced with flights to the likes of Cephalonia and Corfu when the government announced that concern over rising coronavirus cases was such that prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis would be holding an emergency meeting with senior cabinet members to discuss possible enforcement of new restrictions. The wearing of masks and local lockdowns are reportedly on the agenda with some epidemiologists suggesting that fines may now be in order for those who fail to don face coverings. Today’s emergency meeting – currently underway – comes amid media reports that all 6,000 British tourists expected to fly into Greece today will be tested upon arrival. The leading Greek daily, Protothema, wrote: The result of the mass testing … will determine if Greek borders remain open or not to Britain. If the number and percentage of those found to be positive is low, and is limited to less than 30 to 40 cases, then with constant inspections and epidemiological oversight, the British tourist market will remain open. If not the centre right government would not hesitate to shut the borders again “calculating that the cost of the risk of the coronavirus spreading is much more important than any benefits to tourism in a year that is considered largely lost.” Greece has been a rare success story in its handling of the pandemic but since reopening borders on 1 July has seen a sharp uptick in coronavirus cases that is now alarming health officials in the tourist-dependent country. South Africa’s cases of Covid-19 were set to reach 300,000 on Wednesday, the most in Africa and in the top 10 in the world, despite a swiftly imposed lockdown aimed at preventing infections spiralling as they did in the West. Africa’s most industrialised nation has 298,292 cases at the last count, and with positive tests now increasing at a rate of more than 10,000 a day, it is all but certain to vault over the 300,000 mark when the ministry releases nightly figures. At the end of March, President Cyril Ramaphosa took aggressive, early action, shutting shops, ordering people to stay at home and sending the army on to the streets to enforce it - when South Africa had only 400 cases and no recorded deaths. Bulgaria’s unemployment rate dropped to 8.3% in June from 9.0% in May as the country’s labour market slowly recovered from stringent restrictions aimed at containing the coronavirus, data showed. The jobless rate was 5.2% in June 2019. About 35% of the people who lost their jobs since the middle of March due to the coronavirus crisis have already taken their old jobs back and government-funded programmes have also helped limit dole-queues, the agency said. The World Health Organization said on Wednesday that it was “concerned” about reports of pneumonia in Turkmenistan, a closed Central Asian country that has yet to declare any coronavirus cases. WHO’s Senior Emergency Officer for Europe Catherine Smallwood recommended the government adopt measures including contact tracing “as if Covid-19 were already circulating.” “We are aware of and concerned of reports of acute respiratory disease or pneumonia,” Smallwood said. She credited the government’s “recent activation of stronger measures” as part of efforts to prevent the potential spread of the virus in the country. Turkmenistan on Monday began apprehending citizens for not wearing masks after the health ministry warned of “high concentrations of dust” and “pathogens” in the air. The US has seen 67,000 cases in a single day – the highest number in 24 hours so far. Below is a summary of the latest news from around the globe. Vaccine hope American biotech firm Moderna says it will start the final stage of human trials for its vaccine candidate on July 27, after promising results from earlier testing. The study should run until October 2022 but preliminary results should be available long before then. Staying home in Catalonia Following a standoff with the courts, the Catalan regional government in Spain tells residents to stay home in and around the city of Lerida, a measure affecting 160,000 people. Regional officials issue a similar call in several districts of Hospitalet de Llobregat, a city near Barcelona. Hong Kong tones down Bars, gyms, and beauty salons close again in the city, a ban on gatherings with more than four people comes into force and while most residents voluntarily adopt facemasks, the government now requires passengers on public transport to wear them or risk a fine. Tokyo top alert Tokyo is on its highest coronavirus alert level after a spike in new cases, the city’s governor warns, as experts say the rising infections are a clear “red flag”, though the move to a top alert does not mean the city will ask businesses to close or events to be postponed. More than 578,000 deaths The pandemic has killed at least 578,746 people worldwide since it surfaced in China late last year, according to an AFP tally at 1100 GMT on Wednesday based on official sources. The United States is the worst-hit country with 136,466 deaths. It is followed by Brazil with 74,133, Britain with 44,968, Mexico with 36,327, and Italy with 34,984 fatalities. Australia urges caution Authorities in Australia plead with the public to heed social distancing guidelines, with some five million people locked down in Melbourne. The appeal comes days after a group was fined Aus$26,000 (US$18,200) when their house party was exposed by a large takeout food order. Hello everyone. I am just stepping in to take over the blog while my colleague Haroon takes a break. Please do get in touch to share your comments, and news tips with me. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Senegal has today resumed international flights, four months after severing air links because of the coronavirus pandemic, AFP reports. An Air Algerie flight arrived at Dakar’s international airport at midnight Tuesday and six other flights were scheduled to depart and arrive throughout the day, according to the Ministry of Air Transport. Passengers departing for the West African country are required to present proof from an approved laboratory that they have tested negative for coronavirus within the previous seven days. The certificate has to come from a lab in the country where the trip originated. International commercial flights for repatriation had continued to depart and arrive intermittently in Dakar after the closure of air borders in March. Land and sea borders remain closed. Senegal lifted its state of emergency and curfew, imposed in March to stem the spread of the virus, at the end of June. The restrictions had triggered violent protests, as seen in several countries in the region. The number of cases in Senegal continues to climb, however, with more than 8,300 infections and 153 deaths recorded since 2 Marc. President Macky Sall said in a televised speech last month that the impoverished country could see a recession due to the pandemic, and that “productive activity must be resumed in order to get our economy going again”. Voters in North Macedonia are donning masks to take part in a general election today, after months of delays due to the coronavirus pandemic. AFP has published this useful global guide to where localised lockdowns have been imposed in response to fresh coronavirus outbreaks: Europe SPAIN: The Catalan regional government today told residents to stay home in an area in and around the north-eastern city of Lleida, a measure affecting around 160,000 people. They are allowed to leave to go to work, buy food or medication, or to exercise. Moves to reconfine the local population had triggered a legal standoff on 13 July when a local court blocked the new order, prompting the regional government to enact legislative changes. PORTUGAL: Lockdown at home has been in place since 1 July for 700,000 inhabitants in the Lisbon region, for a period of at least two weeks. BRITAIN: On 30 June, the city of Leicester began a localised two-week lockdown with non-essential shops shutting. Face masks will be compulsory in all shops and supermarkets in England from 24 July. Asia INDIA: The northern Indian state of Bihar, with a population of around 125 million people, will go into a 15-day lockdown from 16-31 July. The southern city and IT hub Bangalore, home to more than 13 million people, also began a week-long confinement on 14 July. New restrictions have also been introduced in the western city of Pune and other states including Uttar Pradesh, home to 200 million people, badly hit Tamil Nadu and Assam. THE PHILIPPINES: The 250,000 inhabitants of Navotas, a district in Manila, will go back into lockdown for two weeks in the coming days, an official said on 13 July. AZERBAIJAN: A strict lockdown was reinstated from 22 June to 1 August. UZBEKISTAN: The central Asian nation imposed a new lockdown on 10 July. Restaurants, sports centres, swimming pools and non-food shops are closed until 1 August. Americas US: California on 13 July drastically rolled back its reopening plans and ordered all indoor restaurants, bars and cinemas to close again. Churches, gyms, shopping malls, hair salons and non-essential offices must shut indoor operations in half of state’s worst-hit and most densely populated counties, including Los Angeles. ARGENTINA: A toughening of lockdown measures in Buenos Aires and its surrounding area has been imposed from 1-17 July. COLOMBIA: Bogota on 13 July enforced a strict zonal lockdown, affecting 2.5 million people, to restrict movement for the next two weeks. Africa MOROCCO: The city of Tangiers and its population of around one million, has been locked down again since 13 July. MADAGASCAR: The capital Antananarivo has gone under a fresh lockdown to last until 20 July. SOUTH AFRICA: A curfew from 9pm to 4am came back into effect on 13 July. Middle East WEST BANK: The Palestinian Authority on 12 July extended a lockdown of the occupied West Bank decided on 3 July, also imposing a curfew. ISRAEL: New restrictions came into force on 7 July, including the closure of bars and sports centres and a limit on the number of people in public places. Some towns and neighbourhoods across the country, considered pandemic hotspots, are living under even stricter restrictions. Oceania AUSTRALIA: Five million people have been obliged to stay at home since 9 July for six weeks in Australia’s second biggest city, Melbourne. The state of Victoria, where Melbourne is located, has closed all its borders to protect the rest of the country. The popular holiday resort of Magaluf is closing its party strip of Punta Ballena after footage of drunken British tourists flouting regulations about wearing masks and social distancing while dancing on cars prompted an outcry. The Mirror quoted the Balearic Islands’ tourism minister, Iago Negueruela, as saying: All commercial establishments, bars and restaurants in these streets will have to close following the publication of an official government bulletin which will be today. They will have to close today. We cannot tolerate the sort of images we have been seeing over the last few days and we are not going to tolerate it. Our tourist and economic activity depends on our image. We urge the general population and the tourists to obey rules on social distancing and the other measures put in place by the Balearic Islands government. It says the closure order also affects two other notorious party strips including one in S’Arenal east of Palma called Calle del Jamon, which is popular with Germans. Iran said today that 140 of its health workers had died of the novel coronavirus, with thousands of others infected. The Islamic republic has been struggling to contain the Middle East’s worst Covid-19 outbreak since announcing its first cases in mid-February. In televised remarks, health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari said: Five thousand of our doctors and nurses have been infected with Covid-19, and tragically, we have lost 140 of them. We all owe them our lives and to honour them, we must observe health protocols. Iran has been battling a resurgence of Covid-19, with official figures showing a rise in both new infections and deaths since a two-month low in May. Lari said the country had recorded 13,410 deaths overall, with 199 in the past 24 hours. She said a further 2,388 people had also tested positive for Covid-19, raising the total cases confirmed to 264,561. Amnesty International has estimated that more than 3,000 health workers have died globally, although it says the figure is likely to be a significant underestimate. It found the US, Russia and the UK (when social care workers are added) to have the highest death tolls among health workers. Levels of childhood immunisations against dangerous diseases such as measles, tetanus and diphtheria have dropped alarmingly during the Covid-19 pandemic, putting millions of children at risk, United Nations agencies said today. In a joint report with Unicef, the World Health Organization (WHO) director general Tedros, Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned: The avoidable suffering and death caused by children missing out on routine immunisations could be far greater than Covid-19 itself. Three-quarters of 82 countries that responded to a survey for the report said they had suffered coronavirus-related disruptions to their immunisation programmes as of May 2020. Most problems were linked to a lack of sufficient personal protection equipment (PPE) for health workers, travel restrictions, and low health worker staffing levels - all of which led to immunisation services being curbed or shut down. At least 30 measles vaccination campaigns have been or are at risk of being cancelled, threatening new outbreaks of the contagious viral disease this year and beyond, the report said. Measles outbreaks were already on the rise, infecting nearly 10 million people in 2018 and killing 140,000 of them - mostly children, according to WHO data. For diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, preliminary data for the first four months of 2020 “points to a substantial drop” in the number of children getting all three doses of the DTP vaccine that protects against them, the report said - the first time in 28 years that the world could see a fall in coverage for this routine childhood immunisation. The report said progress on immunisation was already stalling before the new coronavirus emerged and spread around the world, but the pandemic made a bad situation worse. Austria will lift its travel warning for Lombardy, the region at the centre of Italy’s coronavirus outbreak, because of a fall in infections, Austria’s foreign ministry said today. The relaxation could pave the way for the resumption of flights between Lombardy’s capital Milan and Vienna, since such travel warnings come with a ban on direct connections. Austria lifted controls, thereby allowing land crossings, at the shared border a month ago, three months after they were introduced when Italy’s outbreak worsened. “The epidemiological development of the province, which was hit first and particularly hard by the pandemic, now makes this step possible,” Austria’s foreign ministry said in a statement, adding that the travel warning would be lifted tomorrow. The coronavirus has killed approximately 35,000 people in Italy, the fifth highest number in the world after the United States, Brazil, Britain and Mexico. Austria, by contrast, has reported just 710 deaths so far. The EU’s public health body is assessing risks posed by ventilation systems and other settings at workplaces for the transmission of the novel coronavirus through the air, in addition to through droplets, its head said. From Reuters: The announcement by the European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDP) could show a commitment tackling the potential spread through fine airborne mists known as aerosols, which the World Health Organization (WHO) acknowledged as a possible danger only last week. While the virus is believed to spread mainly through contaminated droplets, Europe’s ECDC has long warned it might also spread through the air in mists. That could pose extra risk in enclosed spaces, especially with poor ventilation, risks that could rise in winter as people spend more time indoors. Andrea Ammon, who chairs the ECDC, told Reuters there was still no evidence to show what proportion of cases were spread by aerosols rather than droplets, but “we know both are a possibility”. Last week, the WHO said the virus could spread through aerosols, although it stopped short of saying this had been confirmed. The global health body had come under pressure from scientists, who wrote a letter calling on it to acknowledge the potential for airborne spread. Ammon said the ECDC was assessing risks in the workplace, which would be heightened by airborne transmission, after several localised outbreaks in plants throughout Europe, with the most serious in a slaughterhouse in Germany in June. “We are working on a technical report on occupational settings and risk factors for such outbreaks,” she said, adding dangers posed by ventilation systems were being assessed. Many of the social distancing and hygiene guidelines that countries have adopted during the Covid-19 pandemic are based on preventing contact with droplets of saliva or mucous expelled by carriers of the virus when they cough, sneeze or speak. Preventing airborne spread could require other strategies. Ammon said the ECDC still assumes droplets are the most common vehicle of transmission. She said there was no need at this stage to update the agency’s guidance, and reiterated that it was crucial that people continue to respect social distancing rules and wear face masks. The European commission said today that European Union states should launch earlier and broader vaccination campaigns against flu this year to reduce the risk of simultaneous influenza and Covid-19 outbreaks in the autumn, Reuters reports. The EU executive wants to prevent the risk of hospitals being again overwhelmed by a surge of patients, as happened at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic in Europe in March and April. “Simultaneous outbreaks of seasonal influenza and Covid-19, would place a considerable strain on health systems,” it said in a document which lists actions needed to prepare for a possible large second wave of Covid-19 in the autumn. It called on EU governments to bring forward flu vaccinations to the summer. People in Europe usually get their annual flu shots in the autumn. Brussels also urged states to: Buy more shots against influenza Increase the number of people who are vaccinated. Test more people for coronavirus infections Set up efficient contact tracing systems. The commission wants governments to use contact-tracing apps that are interoperable across EU borders but at this stage only 10 of the 27 EU states have launched such applications. Hello, this is Haroon Siddique taking over the blog. You can contact me via the following channels: Twitter: @Haroon_Siddique email: haroon[dot]siddique[at]theguardian[dot]com I’ll leave you with Reuter’s sobering live tracker, following the spread of the novel coronavirus. Not a cheery sign-off, ‘tis true, but a sign-off nonetheless. Reuters is reporting that the Tokyo Olympics may have to be postponed again if the novel coronavirus mutates into a stronger pathogen. “I think the virus is mutating all the time … it may be a much stronger virus that triggers a second wave,” Kiyoshi Kurokawa, a prominent Japanese government adviser, told Reuters. He also said that a recent increase in cases in Tokyo is due to a failure to stick to guidelines to prevent contagion. A physician who served as a science adviser to the Japanese cabinet from 2006-08, Kurokawa also headed an independent investigation into the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. Currently, he is advising the government on the coronavirus pandemic. “I think it’s small incidents happening in Tokyo … new cases are because people are not abiding by recommendations,” Kurokawa said of the increase in infections. “But if there are some mutations, that is a completely different story. That could happen anywhere in the world.” Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike told Reuters on Monday the Olympics, originally scheduled to start this month but put off to 2021 because of the pandemic, must go ahead next year as a symbol of world unity in overcoming coronavirus. Kurokawa was appointed last month to head a panel to examine how to use artificial intelligence to fight the spread of the virus. His appointment to the four-person group including a Nobel prize-winning geneticist came after economics minister Yasutoshi Nishimura abruptly announced he would dissolve a panel of scientific experts and remake it with new members. The move came amid reports of clashes between the health experts and politicians. Kurokawa said that whatever experts recommended based on science, political leaders had to make the final policy call. “The scientific community’s recommendations have to be fact-based, science-based recommendations, but politicians have to make the decisions,” he said. “Scientists give advice, but decision-making is not by scientists.” AP is carrying a story that you really need to read on their site, to see the wonderful photos that illustrate the personal stories, about the artists who perform in the concerts, acrobatic shows, and striptease dance revues that typically entertain thousands of tourists in Las Vegas, as they wait for their venues to reopen. Though casinos have been allowed to reopen with rules about sanitising, social distancing and mandatory face masks, hundreds of performers, including those who’ve come to the city from all over the world, are waiting in Las Vegas for the shows and crowds to return. As they wait, they try to keep their bodies in top form, practise their skills and find a way to perform. Melissa James, a dancer and aerialist in the show “Extravaganza” at Bally’s casino-resort, said it was heartbreaking when, after weeks of grueling rehearsals, Covid-19 closures shut down her show after its debut night in March. Since then, she said, “we’ve kind of just been waiting here, trying to stay in shape and stay fresh and ready, should we get the go-ahead that shows will allowed again”. While largely quarantining at home, James said she does circuit workouts to keep up her stamina and uses equipment at home and a recently reopened circus training space to work on strength and aerial skills. To stay inspired, she practises ballet and works on choreography. “As artists, we’re not sitting here cooling our heels,” she said. “Every day we’re trying to be creative.” Reuters is reporting that 160,000 people in the Spanish region of Catalonia returned to confinement today as authorities scrambled to control a fresh surge of coronavirus infections in the area, weeks after a nationwide lockdown was lifted. A judge finally approved the regional government’s stay-at-home order for residents of the city of Lleida and six nearby towns last night after several days of legal wrangling and political tensions over the issue. Under the new rules, people may only leave their homes for essential activities like working or buying supplies, while hotels, restaurants and bars will close except for food pick-up or delivery. Regional authorities have also encouraged the residents of three neighbourhoods in L’Hospitalet, a Barcelona suburb that is home to around 260,000 people, to stay home, but that’s not a mandatory confinement. Another judge refused to rubber-stamp a proposed restriction on gatherings of more than 10 people there. After more than 28,000 deaths from the pandemic, Spain’s government ended a nationwide lockdown on 21 June, considering it had dealt with the worst of the virus as the number of contagions had ground to a near halt. But since then, more than 170 clusters have sprung up around Spain, prompting regional authorities to impose a patchwork of local restrictions, confusing locals and angering businesses. Our very own Damian Carrington is reporting that a nature-led coronavirus recovery could create $10tn a year. A World Economic Forum report says 400m jobs could be created - and warns there will be ‘no jobs on a dead planet’ The report also warns that when the world recovers from the coronavirus pandemic there can be no business-as-usual, with today’s destruction of the natural world threatening over half of global GDP. In 2019, scientists warned that human society was in jeopardy from the accelerating decline of the Earth’s natural life-support systems. The report, from the New Nature Economy project, published by the WEF, says a nature-first approach from business and political leaders will be a jobs-first solution. Reuters is reporting on comments by the Bank of England policymaker, Silvana Tenreyro, that Britain’s economic recovery will probably take the shape of an “incomplete V” as consumers stay wary of the coronavirus, social distancing rules curb activity and unemployment rises. “Assuming prevalence [of the virus] gradually falls, my central case forecast is for GDP to follow an interrupted or incomplete ‘V-shaped’ trajectory, with the first quarterly step-up in Q3,” she said. Data published yesterday showed Britain’s gross domestic product grew by a slower than expected 1.8% in May from April, when it slumped by 20%. The government’s budget forecasters said the economy could shrink by as much as 14.3% this year. Tenreyro said she was not putting much importance on May’s weak GDP growth figure and spelled out what she believed would be an initial bounce-back followed by a slowdown. “We are already seeing indications of a sharp recovery in purchases that were restricted only because of mandated business closures,” she said in a speech during an online event organised by the London School of Economics. “But I think that this will be interrupted by continued risk aversion and voluntary social distancing in some sectors, remaining restrictions on activities in others, and in general, by higher unemployment.” Yesterday’s projections by the Office for Budget Responsibility had the unemployment rate rising as high as 13% from just under 4% in the most recent reading. Tenreyro said downward pressure on inflation was likely to persist for sometime and cited “considerable downside risks” for demand. “I remain ready to vote for further action as necessary to support the economy,” she said. And now for some light relief: Lauren Laverne is doing a face mask-themed programme today on BBC6 Music. If you can think of any tunes about people wearing masks, then drop her a line … Reuters is reporting that one small firm in three around the world was obliged to cut jobs to stay open through the coronavirus pandemic in May, underlining how hard the outbreak has slammed the world economy. Some 26% of small and medium-sized businesses surveyed by Facebook, in partnership with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the World Bank, said they had closed between January and May 2020. The survey polled more than 30,000 small business leaders from more than 50 countries. Out of the businesses that remained operational when the survey was conducted, on May 28-31, nearly two in three cited lower sales in the previous 30 days compared with the same time a year earlier. To deal with what the report called “the challenge of a lifetime”, a third of smaller businesses surveyed that were in operation during the poll said they had reduced their labour force. “The Covid-19 pandemic isn’t just a public health emergency; it’s also an economic crisis that is hitting small and medium-sized businesses exceptionally hard,” according to the report. Small and medium-sized firms with a business page on Facebook were surveyed in the first of a series of six-monthly data collections aimed at examining the impact of the pandemic on smaller enterprises. The coronavirus outbreak forced governments globally to impose lockdown measures this year, crippling economic activity and tipping some economies into recession. The International Monetary Fund said in June it expects global output to shrink 4.9% in 2020. The survey said consumer-focused sectors were hit the hardest. Some 54% of tourism agencies and 47% of smaller businesses working in hospitality and events management said they were closed at the time of the survey. Businesses led by women were more likely to be closed at the time of the survey than those led by men. “Not only do a greater proportion of female business leaders operate micro-businesses with no employees, but female-led SMBs (small businesses) are also concentrated in the sectors that have been most affected by lockdown measures,” the report said. We’re carrying a fascinating exclusive with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism on how a litany of failings meant that when Italy faced disaster, its distress call to the EU met with a shocking silence The article relates how it all began with “a moment of chilling clarity” on 26 February. With the numbers of Italians known to be infected by coronavirus tripling every 48 hours, the country’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, appealed to fellow EU member states for help. His hospitals were overwhelmed. Italian doctors and nurses had run out of the masks, gloves and aprons they needed to keep themselves safe, and medics were being forced to play God with the lives of the critically ill due to an acute lack of ventilators. An urgent message was passed from Rome to the European commission’s Berlaymont headquarters in Brussels. The specifications of Italy’s needs were uploaded into the EU’s Common Emergency Communication and Information System (CECIS). But what happened next came as a shock. The distress call was met with silence. “No member state responded to Italy’s request and to the commission’s call for help,” said Janez Lenarčič, the European commissioner responsible for crisis management. “Which meant that not only is Italy is not prepared … Nobody is prepared … The lack of response to the Italian request was not so much a lack of solidarity. It was a lack of equipment.” Leaders have been asked fundamental questions about the purpose of the European project when states fail to come to each other’s aid at the darkest times. This weekend, the EU’s 27 heads of state and government will meet in Brussels for the first time in person for five months to try to plot a way forward. In our article today, through both analysis of internal records and interviews with dozens of EU officials and experts in both Brussels and the bloc’s capitals, we tell the full story of how Europe emerged to be the WHO-designated “epicentre” of a global pandemic and what key lessons might be learned. It is a story of well-meaning officials in Brussels speaking in urgent tones of an impending disaster to empty press conference rooms. Of increasingly desperate health ministers unable to convince their heads of government and finance ministries of the scale of what was coming and the imperative to act. Of governments belatedly recognising the speed at which the virus was spreading, only to rush into uncoordinated acts of protectionism in moments of ill-concealed panic. And of EU institutions and agencies in which central figures either lacked the experience or powers to get capitals to act together in the face of a disease with respect for neither borders nor the glacial pace of Brussels’ bureaucracy. It is the story of an EU caught ill-equipped and institutionally incapable of mounting an adequate response to the crisis that so swiftly engulfed it. Worrying snippet on Reuters that Russia has just reported 6,422 new coronavirus cases, pushing its confirmed national tally to 746,369, the fourth highest in the world. Officials said 156 people had died of the virus in the last 24 hours, bringing the official death toll to 11,770. In the latest twist to the “should we or shouldn’t we face-mask?”, Reuters is reporting that the top doctor in the Swiss mountain region that includes St Moritz and Davos told restaurants yesterday not to rely on plastic visors to protect their employees from Covid-19 infections, saying they “create a false sense of security”. The warning, from the Grisons canton bordering Italy and Austria, raises questions about the reopening strategies of some restaurants, hotels and other tourist-dependent businesses. In Germany, some states allow visors for service workers, while others require face masks. Swiss restaurants don’t require all workers to wear protective facial coverings, though some have adopted them. The Grisons cantonal doctor, Marina Jamnicki, said face masks for restaurant staff who cannot keep a 1.5-metre (4.9 ft) distance from others were a better solution than transparent plastic shields secured by a headband. “An analysis of the cases and the path in which the disease spread shows plastic visors being used in gastronomy don’t offer sufficient protection,” her office said. “People who wore visors got infected.” The Swiss federal health office did not return queries about potential action, given Jamnicki’s warning. Marc Tischhauser, director of the Grisons restaurant industry association, told Reuters the doctor’s warning was a reminder that visors play a “complementary role” in protecting against Covid-19 infections, and that proper social distancing and face masks are also necessary to be effective. The World Health Organization last month updated guidance urging face masks be worn in public, while conceding only observational evidence, not scientific studies, showed they helped contain the new coronavirus’s spread. Germany’s Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for public health said masks are better because they “slow the speed of breath or the dispersion of spit and slime drops” while visors “just capture drops that land on the screen”. Germany’s 16 states have final say in what to require. In Hessen, where Frankfurt is located, service workers can use visors, while Bavaria’s health office advises they can be used “only to reinforce a mask covering the mouth and nose”. A similar debate is taking place in the US. Many airlines in European countries including Germany, Italy and France require masks that cover the nose and mouth. Qatar Airways requires passengers to wear both a mask and face shield. AFP is reporting on Tokyo being on its highest coronavirus alert level after a rise in new cases – particularly in younger people, in nightlife areas and also in workplaces and in families – as experts said the rising infections were a clear “red flag”. However, the move to a “red” alert does not mean the city will ask businesses to close or events to be postponed. Even during a national state of emergency in April, there was no “lockdown” in Japan of the type seen in Europe. “The experts just told us that the situation of infections is at the fourth level of the four-level system, which means ‘the infections seem to be spreading,’” governor Yuriko Koike said during a meeting on the virus. Authorities say many of the new cases come from night-life entertainment districts in the capital and those infected appear to be people in their 20s and 30s, who are less likely to become seriously ill with the coronavirus. As of today, there were only seven people requiring intensive care for coronavirus and authorities have insisted that the medical system is in better shape than at the height of the previous wave in April. And despite the latest outbreak, the situation in Japan remains considerably less serious than in many other comparable countries in terms of population. Japan has had just over 22,500 cases and close to 1,000 deaths since the disease was first detected in the country. No one has died of coronavirus in Tokyo for three weeks. AP is also reporting on how virus restrictions in Australia are being reimposed, shutting businesses and curbing people’s social lives as communities try to curb a disease resurgence before it spins out of control. Residents of Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest city, were warned today to comply with lockdown regulations or face tougher restrictions. Melbourne’s 5 million people and part of the city’s semi-rural surrounds are a week into a new, six-week lockdown to contain a new outbreak there. “The time for warnings, the time for cutting people slack is over,” Victoria state premier Daniel Andrews said. “Where we are is in a very serious and deadly position.” Victoria reported 238 new cases, which authorities say may indicate a stabilising trend under way in Melbourne’s outbreak. AP is reporting the bitter-sweet news that Florida surpassed its daily record for coronavirus deaths yesterday at the same moment that researchers announced that the first vaccine tested in the US had worked to boost patients’ immune systems. Florida’s 132 additional deaths topped a state mark set just last week. The figure probably includes deaths from last weekend that had not been previously reported. The new deaths raised the state’s seven-day average to 81 per day, more than double the figure of two weeks ago and now the second-highest in the US behind Texas. The worrying figures were released just hours before the news about the experimental vaccine, developed by the National Institutes of Health and Moderna Inc. “No matter how you slice this, this is good news,” Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government’s top infectious disease expert, told the Associated Press. Key final testing of the vaccine will start around 27 July, tracking 30,000 people to prove if the shots really work in preventing infection. Tuesday’s announcement focused on findings since March in 45 volunteers. There are conflicting theories about what is driving the outbreak. “We tried to give states guidance on how to reopen safely … If you look critically, few states actually followed that guidance,” Dr Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday in a livestream interview with the editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association. Redfield said people in many states did not adopt social distancing and other measures because they hadn’t previously experienced an outbreak. But he went on to say, without explanation, that he didn’t believe the way those states handled reopening was necessarily behind the explosive rise in virus cases. He offered a theory that infected travellers from elsewhere in the country might have brought the virus with them around Memorial Day. The Mighty Amelia Hill reporting for duty! I pledge to safely guide you through the next few hours and deposit you on the other side, somewhat better informed than we all are now. Let our mission begin.... That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today. I leave you in the fine company of the mighty Amelia Hill. Wednesday briefing: ‘Super-spreading event’ closed A&amp;E ward A nurse who was carrying coronavirus unwittingly infected 16 others during a training session in what was described as a “super-spreading event” that led to Hillingdon hospital closing its A&amp;E unit, an inquiry has found. Nurses did not wear face masks or stay two metres apart. Staff at the London hospital say they are baffled as to why the training session was allowed to go ahead, given that most medical training in the NHS is now done online to avoid people gathering. Coronavirus outbreaks are up to 20 times more likely in large care homes, according to a major study seen by the Guardian, prompting calls to divide them into “bubbles” before any second wave hits. And a new points-based checklist being made available from the British Medical Association website [PDF] could help keep healthcare workers safe by offering a way to calculate their risk of severe illness or death from Covid-19, researchers have said, stressing its usefulness for workers of black, Asian and ethnic minority heritage: Japan’s economy will contract 4.7% in the year to March 2021, the central bank said Wednesday, projecting a recovery the following year but warning deep uncertainty remains. The fresh outlook, with policymakers giving a range of shrinkage from 5.7 to 4.5%, is a downgrade from an April projection of a 5.0-3.0% contraction. The Bank of Japan stayed hopeful about a future recovery but said the outlook was shrouded by possible future waves of the virus, which made calculations difficult. “Japan’s economy is likely to improve gradually from the second half of this year with economic activity resuming, but the pace is expected to be only moderate while the impact of the novel coronavirus remains worldwide,” the BoJ said in a statement. The bank said it expected the global economy to steadily recover, projecting Japanese GDP would expand 3.3% in the year to March 2022, before logging 1.5-% growth in the following fiscal year. But it also stressed that “the outlook... is extremely unclear” with its assumptions involving “high uncertainties”. As always, we welcome tips, feedback, questions and news from.

Here are the key developments from the last few hours: Global cases are nearing 13.3m, as cases continue to rise by around 200,000 every 24 hours. There have been 577,954 deaths so far, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Cities and states around the world returned to tighter coronavirus restrictions to battle recurring outbreaks, including India’s IT hub Bangalore which was set to go into a new week-long lockdown on Tuesday as the number of coronavirus cases surged. Tokyo is considering raising its alert for coronavirus infections to the highest of four levels, officials said on Wednesday, after a spike in cases to record numbers in the Japanese capital. Fearing a second wave of infections spreading from the capital, local municipalities and opposition lawmakers also urged the central government to suspend a major campaign aimed at boosting domestic tourism. Egyptian doctors targeted for highlighting Covid-19 working conditions. Overwhelmed and ill-equipped medical staff in Egypt are being threatened for speaking out about poor working conditions during the Covid-19 pandemic, with increasing numbers detained by a domestic security agency. 133m re-enter lockdown in India as Covid-19 cases top 900,000. Late on Tuesday, India’s coronavirus cases, the third-highest in the world, passed 900,000, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The current total stands at 906,752, with 23,727 known deaths. The northern Indian state of Bihar, which has a population of 125 million, has been ordered into a new 15-day lockdown to combat coronavirus. The announcement came a few hours before the southern city and IT hub Bangalore, with a population of 8 million, was due to go into a week-long lockdown. Trump says it’s a ‘mistake’ to keep schools closed. US President Donald Trump said in an interview on Tuesday that it was a “mistake” for the two largest California school districts, Los Angeles and San Diego, to keep schools closed in the fall. Trump has pushed for schools to open up for the school year even as states across the country see a surge in cases of the coronavirus and amid questions about whether schools can hold in-person classes safely. Australian state of Victoria records 238 new cases. The Australian state of Victoria has recorded 238 new cases of Covid-19 and the death of a woman in her 90s and New South Wales has recorded 13 new cases, including 10 linked to the Crossroads Hotel cluster in south-west Sydney which has now affected 34 people. Australian PM says Australia can’t be shut down to contain second Covid-19 wave. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the response to a second wave of Covid-19 infections cannot be shutting the country down to try to eliminate the virus, and he’s moved to reassure people his government will not be withdrawing income support “for those in need”. Venezuela’s capital Caracas will go into a strict lockdown on Wednesday, in a bid to slow its coronavirus outbreak. Much of Venezuela has been shut down since its first case was reported in early March. Air travel has been suspended until 12 August. It has confirmed 9,707 cases and 93 deaths. However, observers worry that the infamously opaque government of Nicolás Maduro is underreporting the numbers. In France masks will become mandatory in all enclosed public spaces within the next few weeks,President Emmanuel Macron has said in a major Bastille Day interview. This comes as a a French study revealed the case of a baby boy infected with coronavirus in the womb This is believed to be first such confirmed case but doctors say infant has made good recovery. In the UK, a new points-based checklist could help keep healthcare workers safe by offering a way to calculate their risk of severe illness or death from Covid-19, researchers have said, stressing its usefulness for workers of black, Asian and ethnic minority heritage. Covid-19 has been shown in multiple reports to disproportionately affect BAME communities, while in May it was revealed that more than 60% of healthcare workers who have died from Covid-19 were from BAME backgrounds: New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has warned that “perfection” in response to the Covid-19 pandemic “is just not possible” as she urged New Zealanders against complacency and laid out her government’s plans for future outbreaks. “Every country we have sought to replicate or have drawn from in the fight against Covid has now experienced further community outbreaks,” Ardern said in a speech at New Zealand’s parliament in Wellington. “We only need to look to [the Australian states of] Victoria, New South Wales; Hong Kong, Singapore and Korea to see examples of other places that like us had the virus under control at a point in time only to see it emerge again.” Six staff affiliated with Melbourne’s Royal Women’s hospital are among those confirmed to have Covid-19 as part of Victoria’s recent outbreak, with a concerning number of healthcare workers throughout the state now infected with the virus. The hospital, located in Parkville next to Melbourne city, on Tuesday afternoon sent a notice to staff confirming six active cases and two recovered cases in health staff, including visiting medical officers and other staff who work elsewhere across multiple health services: Some of Norway’s funeral homes have found themselves without work and have turned to the state for aid, AFP reports. Due to declining mortality and cancelled funeral ceremonies, half a dozen Norwegian undertakers, according to a public registry, have turned to the state for help after the initial success of Norway’s handling of Covid-19 left them struggling to make ends meet. On 12 March, Norway’s Prime Minister Erna Solberg announced what she dubbed “the strongest and most intrusive measures” the country had seen in peacetime. Those included the closure of schools, bars and many public spaces, a ban on sports and cultural events and a curb on foreign travel. Since then nearly all of the measures have been lifted and the virus has been mostly contained, in stark contrast to neighbouring Sweden which is still seeing community spread. Overwhelmed and ill-equipped medical staff in Egypt are being threatened for speaking out about poor working conditions during the Covid-19 pandemic, with increasing numbers detained by a domestic security agency. Doctors recounted threats delivered via WhatsApp, official letters or in person. They said hospital managers and government officials told them failing to attend shifts, posting on social media or voicing objections would result in complaints to the National Security Agency, Egypt’s primary internal security body, which rights groups say has arrested multiple healthcare workers: Tokyo is considering raising its alert for coronavirus infections to the highest of four levels, officials said on Wednesday, after a spike in cases to record numbers in the Japanese capital. Fearing a second wave of infections spreading from the capital, local municipalities and opposition lawmakers also urged the central government to suspend a major campaign aimed at boosting domestic tourism. Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, however, said on Wednesday the government would proceed with the so-called ‘Go To’ travel aid campaign, which includes offers such as discounts for shopping and food, but move cautiously. “Obviously we will consider the thoughts of many of our people, while monitoring the situation ahead,” Nishimura, who leads the government’s coronavirus policy, told parliament. In Tokyo, daily coronavirus cases exceeded 200 in four of the last six days, touching an all-time high of 243 cases last Friday as testing among workers in the metropolis’s red-light districts turned up infections among young people in their 20s and 30s. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike confirmed that Tokyo would hold a “monitoring” meeting with experts on Wednesday, moving up the weekly gathering by a day, to discuss the recent rise in cases. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 351 to 199,726, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Wednesday. The reported death toll rose by three to 9,071, the tally showed. Here’s the full story on tracing the coronavirus cluster at a New South Wales pub, from Matilda Boseley and Elias Visontay: Genomic testing indicates the strain of coronavirus causing a large cluster at a hotel in Sydney’s south-west came from Victoria, the New South Wales deputy premier says. The Crossroads Hotel cluster in Casula has now grown to 30 cases, 14 of those from people who attended the pub. John Barilaro on Wednesday said genomic testing of the virus circulating in Casula found links to a strain from Victoria, where hundreds of new Covid-19 cases are being reported each day. Melissa Davey and Elias Visontay report: The Australian state of Victoria has recorded 238 new cases of Covid-19 and the death of a woman in her 90s and New South Wales has recorded 13 new cases, including 10 linked to the Crossroads Hotel cluster in south-west Sydney which has now affected 34 people. Victoria’s deputy police commissioner, Rick Nugent, has outlined disappointing breaches of Covid-19 lockdown measures including people refusing to leave KFC restaurants, playing Pokémon Go and poker in groups, and hiding in garages and closets when caught by police on Wednesday. There are now 105 Victorians in hospital, an increase by 20 from Tuesday, and 27 people are in intensive care. Of the new cases recorded, 209 are still under investigation. The cases have prompted questions about whether tougher restrictions may be needed in Victoria, as Nugent said some people continued to flout lockdown rules. A reminder: A Guardian Australia analysis of Victorian coronavirus cases shows that infections have been increasing in areas outside the locked-down postcodes, and that all significant growth areas are now contained within the wider Melbourne lockdown. Using data aggregated daily from the dashboard of the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) here, we calculated the number of new cases a day for every local government area in Victoria. We then checked to see if cases had increased or decreased over the past fortnight for each area that reported more than five cases during that period. At the time of writing, a map of the results shows there has been significant growth in regions adjacent to the previously locked-down postcodes, with the largest increase in the Wyndham council area. Wyndham is where the Al Taqwa college is located, the site of what is currently the second-largest cluster of cases in Victoria. There has also been an increasing number of cases in the Melton and Darebin council areas. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the response to a second wave of Covid-19 infections cannot be shutting the country down to try to eliminate the virus, and he’s moved to reassure people his government will not be withdrawing income support “for those in need”. Morrison said lockdowns were necessary in Victoria given the significant spike in infections in the state, but “your protection against the virus is not shutting things down all the time”. “You have to do that sometimes, as is the case in Victoria,” he said. He said trying to eliminate the virus wasn’t the “right strategy” for Australia. “You don’t just shut the whole country down because that is not sustainable. I’ve heard that argument. You’d be doubling unemployment potentially, and even worse.” Morrison said it was impossible to achieve elimination “unless we are not going to allow any freight, or medical supplies into Australia, or any exports into Australia, or things like this – there is alway The New York Times reports that the White House is stripping the CDC of control of coronavirus data: The Trump administration has ordered hospitals to bypass the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and send all Covid-19 patient information to a central database in Washington beginning on Wednesday. The move has alarmed health experts who fear the data will be politicized or withheld from the public. In Australia, a cluster of coronavirus cases at a pub called the Crossroads Hotel, in the state of New South Wales has been linked back to a man in Melbourne, Victoria who attended a workplace party. NSW Health contact tracer Jennie Musto has explained the genomic link between Victoria and the NSW outbreak, as a man travelling from Melbourne to Sydney at the end of June. A man from Melbourne came into a workplace in Sydney, and then there’s some transmission within that workplace and then they all went to a party that night of the third of July, at the Crossroads hotel. So this is where it all began. She said he travelled on the 30 June, and works in the freight industry. Musto said this case was linked to six colleagues who have been diagnosed. NSW health minister Dr Kerry Chant has added more about the potential spread of NSW’s current outbreaks: Whilst we’ve had a very strong focus on the Crossroads, a hotel cluster, it is very important that we don’t lose sight of the fact that Covid could have been introduced in any other parts of Sydney, and we may well have had transmission of the virus just continuing. Andrew Cotter, the sports commentator turned labrador commentator in lockdown, has a new dispatch from Olive and Mabel. A shocking crime has taken place: US President Donald Trump on Tuesday shut the door on “Phase 2” trade negotiations with China, saying he does not want to talk to Beijing about trade because of the coronavirus pandemic. “I’m not interested right now in talking to China,” Trump replied when asked in an interview with CBS News whether Phase 2 trade talks were dead. “We made a great trade deal,” Trump said, of the Phase 1 agreement signed in January. “But as soon as the deal was done, the ink wasn’t even dry, and they hit us with the plague,” he said, referring to the novel coronavirus, which first emerged from the Chinese city of Wuhan. For months, Trump has blamed China for sending the coronavirus to the United States, saying that China must be “held accountable” for failing to contain the disease. The pandemic has taken a stiff toll on the US economy, endangering Trump’s hopes for re-election in November. China pledged to increase purchases of US farm and manufactured goods, energy and services by $200 billion over two years as part of the Phase 1 trade deal, but Trump has said the pandemic changed his views on the agreement. At the White House, Trump announced that he signed legislation and an executive order to hold China accountable for the “oppressive” national security law it imposed on Hong Kong. Alabama, Florida and North Carolina reported record daily increases in deaths from Covid-19 on Tuesday, grim new milestones that mark a second wave of infections surging across much of the United States, Reuters reports. Florida, which has become an epicenter of the new outbreak, reported 133 new Covid-19 fatalities on Tuesday, raising the state’s death toll to more than 4,500. “We must all continue to do our part to protect Florida’s most vulnerable and avoid the 3 Cs: closed spaces, crowded places and close-contact settings,” Governor Ron DeSantis wrote on Twitter. “Safeguarding the elderly and those with underlying health conditions will continue to be our top priority.” Alabama reported a record spike of 40 deaths on Tuesday and North Carolina an increase of 35, bringing each state’s total to over 1,100. The number of new US cases reported daily began rising about six weeks ago, driven by increases in southern and western states. Texas saw a record 10,745 new cases on Tuesday. Home rental firm Airbnb Inc said on Tuesday it recorded more than 1 million bookings globally on 8 July, offering an early sign of recovery after a slowdown in reservations during the Covid-19 pandemic. A major part of the bookings are for trips that will start on or before 7 August, the company said, adding it hit the 1 million mark for the first time since 3 March. Airbnb said it was partly due to pent-up demand, with affordable and closer destinations making up for the bulk. The home rental firm has been reeling under weak demand as millions of tourists canceled their vacation plans, work trips and family visits due to the pandemic, prompting it to suspend marketing activities for the year and cut about 25% of its workforce. US school districts hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak, under pressure from President Donald Trump to resume classes, should decide for themselves whether to reopen based on their circumstances, leading infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said on Tuesday, Reuters reports. Asked his views in light of Trump having urged schools to reopen as quickly as possible, Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said, “We should try, as the default, to get the kids to stay in school.” “If you’re in the part of a country where the dynamics of the outbreak are really minimal, if at all, then there’s no problem at all in getting back. If you’re in a situation where you’re in outbreak mode, then you leave it up to the local individuals,” he said, speaking at an online event hosted by Georgetown University. With the new school year due to begin in weeks, some U.S. districts have announced plans to reopen for students who want to attend in-person classes, while others will offer only online instruction or a mix of classroom and remote learning. Brazil recorded 41,857 new cases of the novel coronavirus in the past 24 hours and 1,300 additional deaths, the Health Ministry said on Tuesday. The nation has now registered 1,926,824 total confirmed cases of the virus and 74,133 deaths. Domestic abuse calls to the police surged by more than a tenth in London during lockdown, research reveals, driven by reports from neighbours and family members. There were 45,000 calls to the Metropolitan police concerning domestic abuse in the 11 weeks from 23 March, up 11.4% on average compared with the same period in 2019. The increase – which equated to about 380 more domestic abuse calls a week – was driven by third-party reports, such as neighbours, rather than the victims, researchers at the London School of Economics’ Centre for Economic Performance found. Three people who fled quarantine at a Herefordshire farm at the centre of a Covid-19 outbreak have been found and are now self-isolating, health officials have said. Police had been searching for the trio, one of whom had tested positive for coronavirus, since Monday. It had been announced the previous day that about 200 staff at the vegetable farm and packing business AS Green &amp; Co had been ordered to isolate there. On Tuesday evening, Public Health England said the three had been “reached through the agency who secured their employment and they have confirmed they are self-isolating”. The workers were asked to remain at Rook Row Farm after more than 70 tested positive. There were complaints that dozens of staff had been asked to work through the pandemic without proper protective equipment and no social distancing. US President Donald Trump said in an interview on Tuesday that it was a “mistake” for the two largest California school districts, Los Angeles and San Diego, to keep schools closed in the fall. Trump has pushed for schools to open up for the school year even as states across the country see a surge in cases of the coronavirus and amid questions about whether schools can hold in-person classes safely. Late on Tuesday, India’s coronavirus cases, the third-highest in the world, passed 900,000, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The current total stands at 906,752, with 23,727 known deaths. The northern Indian state of Bihar, which has a population of 125 million, has been ordered into a new 15-day lockdown to combat coronavirus, joining states and cities around the globe that have reintroduced restrictions in recent days to counter fresh resurgences of the disease. As the World Health Organization warned there were “no shortcuts out of the pandemic”, Sushil Kumar Modi, Bihar’s deputy chief minister, said on Tuesday: “[The] Bihar government has decided on a 15-day lockdown from 16 July to 31 July. “All city municipalities, district headquarters, block headquarters will stay under lockdown. The guidelines are being finalised.” The announcement came a few hours before the southern city and IT hub Bangalore, with a population of 8 million, was due to go into a week-long lockdown. After imposing one of the world’s strictest lockdowns in late March, India had been steadily easing rules to lessen the economic impact, particularly on hundreds of millions of poor Indians who lost their jobs, bringing in new measures to ward off or respond to resurgences of the coronavirus pandemic. Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. I’m Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest from the next few hours. As always, we love to hear from you. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan or email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com. The northern Indian state of Bihar, which has a population of 125 million, has been ordered into a new 15-day lockdown to combat coronavirus, joining states and cities around the globe that have reintroduced restrictions in recent days to counter fresh resurgences of the disease. The announcement came a few hours before the southern city and IT hub Bangalore, in Karnataka state, was due to go into a week-long lockdown. Here are the other key developments from the last few hours: Cities and states around the world returned to tighter coronavirus restrictions to battle recurring outbreaks, including India’s IT hub Bangalore which was set to go into a new week-long lockdown on Tuesday as the number of coronavirus cases surged. Venezuela’s capital Caracas will go into a strict lockdown on Wednesday, in a bid to slow its coronavirus outbreak. Much of Venezuela has been shut down since its first case was reported in early March. Air travel has been suspended until 12 August. It has confirmed 9,707 cases and 93 deaths. However, observers worry that the infamously opaque government of Nicolás Maduro is underreporting the numbers. In France masks will become mandatory in all enclosed public spaces within the next few weeks,President Emmanuel Macron has said in a major Bastille Day interview. This comes as a a French study revealed the case of a baby boy infected with coronavirus in the womb This is believed to be first such confirmed case but doctors say infant has made good recovery. Russia reported 6,000 new coronavirus cases. The number of daily cases in Moscow has dropped in recent weeks, and from yesterday rules requiring residents to wear masks outside were relaxed. The confirmed national tally is 739,947, the fourth highest in the world, and the official death toll is 11,614. EU drops Serbia and Montenegro from safe list. The European Union has decided to drop Serbia and Montenegro from its safe list of countries from which non-essential travel is allowed, and did not even discuss including the United States given its sharp rise in coronavirus cases, EU officials have said. The White House dropped plans that would have forced some international students out of the US if the pandemic pushed their coursework online. The Trump administration came to a settlement with Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology after they sued over the proposed measures.
42	Britain’s manufacturers have warned Boris Johnson that former “red wall” seats won by the Tories in last year’s election would be at most risk of severe economic damage from Brexit talks collapsing. Sounding the alarm with less than six months before the end of the Brexit transition period, the manufacturing lobby group Make UK and the accountancy firm BDO said industrial areas in the north of England, the Midlands and Wales could face a “triple whammy” should a deal with the EU fail to emerge. On top of the economic hit to the country at large from coronavirus and Brexit, it said traditional industrial heartlands had greater trade links with the EU than other places, exacerbating the damage to jobs and growth should talks fail. In their regional economic outlook report, Make UK and BDO said regions with formerly solid Labour “red wall” constituencies had a high dependence on exports to the EU, as well as a higher-than-average dependence on manufacturing, which would put them at most risk from a no-deal scenario with barriers to trade and tariffs. It said almost two-thirds of exports from Wales, the north-east of England and Yorkshire and the Humber went to the EU, while the contribution of manufacturing to the economy overall in these regions was higher than the national average. Stephen Phipson, the chief executive of Make UK, said: “Should the UK fail to reach a comprehensive trade agreement with the EU, then those regions with a high concentration of manufacturing and a dependence on Europe as a major market will suffer a triple hit, given the impact of Covid-19. For some companies the combination may prove fatal.” Despite mounting fears over the scale of the economic damage from Britain exiting the transition period without a deal, the government has no plans to publish an economic impact assessment. The last time official analysis of the economic impact was published was in November 2018, as Theresa May struggled to get her Brexit deal through parliament. At that time, the government said Britain’s economy would be 9.3% smaller after 15 years under no deal than it would have been under remain. On Tuesday the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, told MPs on the Commons Treasury committee that it would be difficult for economic forecasters now to come up with an accurate forecast due to the coronavirus crisis. “Given all the uncertainty in our economy I don’t think it would be a particularly accurate or constructive exercise,” he said.
43	A new study has found that elite rugby players of both codes in the UK typically suffer more than five times the number of injuries in their careers than athletes do in non-contact sports, while amateur rugby players suffer three times as many. Most of those who took part in the study played a decade either side of 2000, before rugby union instituted measures to improve the management of player welfare, but as the current generation prepares to return from their lay-offs, the paper published in Sports Medicine reminds them of the toll. The research, led by Durham University’s department of sport and exercise sciences, also puts figures on the long-term effects, with 51% of the sample of retired elite rugby players reporting diagnoses of osteoarthritis, which can be linked to their time in the game, more than twice the number reported by retirees of non-contact sports. Concussion features highly in the results, with 81% of elite players and 76% of amateurs reporting at least one concussion in their careers, compared with 24% of non-contact athletes, taken from cricket, cycling, swimming and running. The study, part of the Global Rugby Health Research Network, is the first to attempt to quantify incidence of injury across a player’s career and the repercussions beyond it. “It’s all well and good to look at injuries from season to season,” says Dr Karen Hind, leader of the research team, “but I think it’s really important to see what these players are exposed to across their careers. This will lead on to their health in later life.” The gnarled veteran with a walking stick is well known to rugby, but as the first wave of players to have spent their whole careers in the professional era reach middle age, the fear is of an ever-greater toll in the decades to come. From 2012 to 2015 World Rugby funded research in New Zealand that has since grown into an independent worldwide study on rugby health, further results of which are expected to come out over the next few years from universities in Canada, Australia and USA, as well as the UK and New Zealand. Professor Patria Hume of the Auckland University of Technology, a co-author of the Durham study, led the research in New Zealand, which arrived at similar conclusions, particularly regarding concussion. “This UK study is completely independent,” she said, “with no funding from World Rugby, and it’s showing the same story.” Of the injuries most often reported to carry lasting after-effects, all rugby players had particular problems with knee ligament injuries (27% of elite players) and shoulder dislocations (21%). Also 15% of the elite rugby players reported the lingering after-effects of concussion, compared with none of the non-contact control group. Since most of the players in the Durham study retired, rugby has woken up to the concussion crisis that enveloped American football. At World Rugby level and in individual unions, measures have been instituted not only to mitigate the risks of head injury but also to try to control the escalating intensity of the sport, both on and off the field. The long-term positive effects of rugby on quality of life were also established in the New Zealand study, but management of the physical impact continues to preoccupy the sport.
44	The Treasury is reviewing a “radical” proposal for a new state-owned body that would manage £35bn of toxic coronavirus debt and help save up to 780,000 British businesses. A City taskforce, the Recapitalisation Group, led by EY and the lobby group TheCityUK, is recommending that a government-owned UK Recovery Corporation be established to handle a growing pile of unsustainable government-backed debt that could otherwise wipe out thousands of businesses and lead to 3 million job losses. Businesses that took on debt through the government-backed coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS) or bounce back loan scheme (BBLS) would be able to apply for special measures through the corporation if they were at risk of default. The UK Recovery Corporation would be able to convert their government-backed debt into special financial instruments such as preference shares or an earnings-based profit tax, giving businesses breathing space to repay and recover from the coronavirus crisis. This would help avoid using taxpayer money to cover unpaid debts if firms otherwise defaulted on their government-backed loans. It is understood that the final report by the Recapitalisation Group, publicly released on 16 July, is being reviewed by the Treasury. Adrian Montague, the former chairman of Aviva and chairman of TheCityUK’s leadership council, said: “It’s clear that the Treasury are grappling with the problem of how they get these loans repaid without impairing the recovery. I think that some of our solutions are quite radical, so I think it’s obviously going to be for the Treasury to decide on how they want to take these ideas forward.” So far, more than 1m businesses have taken on debt of £31.7bn through the BBLS scheme, which is aimed at the UK’s smallest businesses and is 100% government-backed. A further 54,538 loans worth £11.85bn have been granted to small and medium-sized businesses through the CBILS scheme, which comes with an 80% government guarantee. The report estimates that 2.3m businesses will have a CBILS or BBLS loan by the end of March 2021. While BBLS loans, which are interest and payment-free for 12 months, will come up for repayment from March 2021, the City taskforce warned that a solution needed to be in place by the end of October 2020. That is when companies will come under greater financial pressure with the winding down of state measures including the furlough job retention scheme. Montague said: “We had originally thought this would be a problem for March next year, but actually it’s going to hit in Q4 this year when the rent relief starts to end, when the furlough scheme starts to unwind, and when VAT payment deferrals need to be made. So it’s not far away. “We are urging the government to take immediate action to address these issues.” While the government would fully own the UK Recovery Corporation from its launch, it was hoped that private investors would invest in the corporation once the body was established. A HM Treasury spokesperson said: “The work undertaken by TheCityUK is a useful contribution to discussions on how businesses can be best supported through this difficult time, and we will continue to work closely with industry both on the delivery of the government-backed loan schemes, and on supporting businesses.”
45	Almost a third of companies plan to make job cuts in the next three months as the government prepares to wind down its furlough scheme, one of Britain’s leading business lobby groups has warned. Sounding the alarm amid warnings of a steep rise in unemployment, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said 29% of businesses in a survey of 7,400 firms planned to cut the size of their workforce in the next three months. The business lobby group said this was the highest percentage of companies planning to make redundancies since it began tracking employment intentions in 1989. It said big companies with more than 250 staff were more likely to be planning job cuts than smaller firms. Concerns are mounting over the pace of Britain’s economic recovery as the government prepares to wind down its furlough scheme from next month. The Labour party, business leaders and trade unions have warned that a lacklustre rebound and the removal of government support could trigger mass unemployment this year. On Tuesday the Office for Budget Responsibility warned that scaling back the furlough scheme, which covers 80% of the wages of temporarily laid off staff, could lead to a sharper rise in job losses. The Treasury’s independent economics forecaster said at least 10% and as much as a 20% of the 9.4m jobs furloughed on the scheme will be made redundant. As many as 1.2m companies have benefited from the support, at a cost to the exchequer so far of £28.7bn. Issuing three downbeat scenarios for Britain’s economic prospects, the OBR said unemployment would more than double in every eventuality, with the jobless rate set to hit 12% before Christmas under its central scenario. Comfortably surpassing the hit to jobs caused by the 2008 financial crisis, the unemployment rate last peaked close to 12% in 1984. Official figures due to be published on Thursday morning are expected to show a rise in the jobless rate from the current level of 3.9%, as more companies cut jobs amid the financial stress caused by the coronavirus crisis. The BCC said the survey was carried out prior to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announcing up to £30bn of fresh tax and spending measures last week to protect jobs and kickstart Britain’s economic recovery from Covid-19. On Wednesday, Sunak defended the measures outlined in the summer statement in front of MPs on the commons Treasury committee. Admitting he could not protect every job, he said: “We have the prospect of many people losing their jobs. I’m determined to do what I can to protect as many jobs as possible, and I believe this will do that.” The chancellor dismissed calls from business leaders and Labour to offer more support to the hardest-hit sectors of the economy, such as hospitality and retail. “It’s easy to say, ‘oh it should be targeted,’ but no one is able to say which sectors should be excluded from it,” he said, adding that it would be administratively difficult to implement. Sunak also warned companies they should not expect help with their debts from the government, saying firms had entered the crisis with strong balance sheets. He said there would be a “high bar” for bailing out firms with taxpayer funds, and only when a company had some strategic value to Britain and a sustainable future. Despite the additional spending measures promised at the summer economic update, the BCC said Sunak still needed to take further action to limit the damage for jobs, including a temporary cut in employer national insurance contributions and more funding for training staff. Hannah Essex, co-executive director of the BCC, said the chancellor should consider launching the additional support before the autumn budget later this year, to stop substantial redundancies. “Many businesses are suffering from an historic cash crunch and reduced demand, meaning firms will still face tough decisions despite welcome interventions made in the summer statement,” she said.
46	Boohoo has been criticised by the chair of an influential committee of MPs, who said the online fashion firm had failed to address warnings of malpractice at Leicester factories. Philip Dunne, the chairman of the environmental audit committee, which questioned Boohoo co-founder Carol Kane about problems in Leicester factories in November 2018 for a report on the fast fashion industry, has disputed claims the group was not aware of potentially illegal working practices at factories making its garments. Boohoo said on 8 July that it was “shocked and appalled” by allegations that one of its suppliers was employing workers on less than the minimum wage and said it had launched an independent review of its supply chain. However, Dunne questioned how the company could be shocked by reports of malpractice in Leicester. “It is incredible that over a year since the committee highlighted illegal working practices in its supply chain, Boohoo has publicly denied any knowledge of what has been happening for years. “It is shameful that it took a pandemic and the ensuing outrage about working practices in their supply chain for Boohoo finally to be taken to task for turning a blind eye.” He added that Boohoo had not met a pledge to sign up to the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), a body which brings together retailers, trade unions and campaign groups to try and improve practice in supply chains. The ETI said Boohoo had not filed a formal application to join and had ceased directly communicating with it after the body asked the online retailer to enter talks with the Usdaw union over representation for workers at its Burnley warehouse. Peter McAllister, the executive director of the ETI, said that any discussions relating to Boohoo joining the group would have required “robust examination of company operations”. “We are not convinced that [Boohoo] would meet a number of critical aspects essential to ETI membership,” he added. Dunne also criticised Boohoo for not formally recognising or meeting with Usdaw. A spokesperson for Boohoo said: “We acknowledge that we received a letter from the EAC [on Wednesday] afternoon and we will of course be responding in due course.” Shares in the company slipped another 3% on Wednesday, making a 46% drop since the allegations of malpractice in its Leicester factories emerged last week. Rival online fashion retailer Asos revealed on Wednesday that it was considering action against a Leicester supplier after finding the factory to be in breach of its ethical trading standards during the coronavirus outbreak. Nick Beighton, Asos’s chief executive, said one factory had been tagged as “red critical” in the last few months under Asos’s ethical audit process – flagging the need for urgent action over potential risks to workers or gaps in management systems. Beighton said its unnamed Leicester factory had been visited by executives last week and he would be visiting again on Friday before “making a decision accordingly” about its future relationship with Asos.
47	Margrethe Vestager may as well give up. If the EU’s competition commissioner can’t win her highest-profile case in the EU’s second-highest court, then the EU’s tax arrangements, as they apply to multinational tech companies, will remain a free-for-all. In practice, she may plough on. The Luxembourg-based general court’s order that Apple does not need to pay €13bn (£11.7bn) in back taxes to the Irish government can be challenged. Lawyers may yet enjoy many more years of lucrative work. Wednesday’s defeat for Brussels, though, is a reminder of the glacial pace at which international tax reform proceeds. Vestager’s original ruling was made in 2016 and referenced “sweetheart” arrangements between Apple and Ireland’s revenue authority going as far back as 1991. The company was said to be paying tax in Ireland at a rate of under 1% for two decades – just 0.005% in one year. Vestager’s innovation, it seemed, was to regard aggressive tax planning, when blessed by EU members, as a form of illegal state aid. If that principle can’t stand up in court, the commission could be looking at multiple losses. Indeed, it has already lost another case involving Starbucks and the Netherlands. The superficially baffling aspect of the Apple case was that Ireland was on the company’s side; Dublin didn’t want to receive €13bn in back taxes. But, actually, the stance was understandable. After Apple, the next step could have been a challenge to Ireland’s 12.5% corporate tax rate, the main lure for US tech and pharmaceutical companies looking for an EU base. That threat would now seem to have evaporated. So good luck to the OECD in trying to hammer out a common approach to taxing global digital companies, which is supposed to be the next big adventure. If Brussels and EU member states are still fighting battles from the last decade, the US may conclude it can give the whole thing a miss. But two points should still be obvious. First, global tech companies are undertaxed. Second, there is intense public anger at the use of complex tax arrangements. That is what encouraged Vestager to extend her competition brief into tax territory in the first place. Whatever the merits of her legal case, her reading of the public mood was 100% correct. Ethical fund managers didn’t seem shocked when share price was rising Boohoo’s shares are still falling – they’ve almost halved in a fortnight – and one can understand why. The questions keep coming. Philip Dunne, chair of the parliamentary environmental audit committee (EAC), wants answers to six detailed inquiries, ranging from the demands Boohoo put on its suppliers in Leicester during the pandemic to why a pledge to join the clothing industry’s ethical trading initiative has not been honoured. The EAC’s involvement is yet another reminder that allegations of pay abuses and poor working conditions in Leicester’s textile industry are not new. The committee took evidence from leading retailers, including Boohoo co-founder Carol Kane, in 2018 and published a blistering report in 2019 called Fixing Fashion. All the concerns were on full display. The government rejected the report’s recommendations, so Dunne could usefully write another letter to ministers asking why. In the meantime, be amazed at those “ethical” fund managers who are dumping their shares in Boohoo, seemingly shocked by what they’re now hearing about Leicester. Come on, you had your chance to be shocked more than a year ago. The difference, then, one might suggest, was that Boohoo’s share price was rising. Sunak needs to keep open mind during early stage of recovery “I’m not sure it is sensible for the government to have individual equity stakes in hundreds of thousands of businesses,” Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, told the Treasury select committee on Wednesday. One can understand his reticence. A vast portfolio of stakes in companies of many different sizes would be extremely fiddly. But Sunak also needs to face facts: he has underwritten billions upon billions of loans to companies, and can’t simply let defaults rip if there are better alternatives. The Treasury itself obviously wouldn’t have the capacity to conduct thousands of debt-for-equity restructuring negotiations. But it can create an agency to do the job, and it could invite private capital to participate. We are at the early stage of the recovery. Keep an open mind.

50	Ole Gunnar Solskjær has branded it “unfair” that Chelsea have 48 hours longer than Manchester United to recover before their FA Cup semi-final on Sunday. Chelsea’s last match was the 1-0 home win against Norwich on Tuesday whereas United have the trip to Crystal Palace on Thursday before returning to London for the game at Wembley. Solskjær said: “There is a concern, obviously, that they will have had 48 hours’ more rest and recovery than us. It’s not fair. We spoke about a fair scheduling going into this restart and of course it isn’t. But I have to think about Thursday, winning that one, focusing on that one, and then pick up the pieces after that.” United are in fifth place but have Champions League qualification in their own hands because they face Leicester, one place ahead on goal difference, on the final day. “It’s all about recovery, mental and physical recovery, and getting ready for the last games and let’s see from there,” Solskjær said. “It might go down to goal difference at the end.” Solskjær has selected the same XI for the past five league games. He had considered resting Paul Pogba, who has been in impressive form since returning from long-term injury, for the 2-2 draw with Southampton on Monday, but the midfielder wanted to play. “Paul knows that he wouldn’t be dropped. When Paul plays like this he wouldn’t be dropped from any team in the world – France or Man United – but he’s been out [injured] for a long time, there was a question mark before the game [against Southampton]: ‘How do you feel?’ But he felt ready for it, which was great, so now let’s see how he is today or even tomorrow morning. He’s been fantastic since the restart and brought a lot to the team.”
51	The heir to a multimillion-dollar pub empire, Craig Laundy, was dispatched against Australia’s unemployed on Tuesday. The former Liberal MP was quoted by News Corp claiming that it wasn’t, you know, a global, invisible virus that’s killed half a million people keeping people out of work. It was the unwillingness of working people to “get off their backsides”. “Mr Laundy said one mother had declined shifts because she wanted to spend time with her children,” News Corp said, which is outrageous; clearly a lethal pandemic is precisely the time for parents to abandon their children to the disruption and terror. Especially when their mental health is so precarious. But Laundy showed no sympathy for those affected by the historically unprecedented global mental health crisis the virus has provoked. One of Laundy’s hospitality workers overcame the entrenched Australian reticence to discuss mental illness, telling his boss psychological illness impacted his ability to work. Laundy reportedly dismissed it as a “piss-take”. In a national newspaper. What would provoke such cruelty? Ideological loyalty and political desperation. On Monday, the Liberal prime minister began to soften his path for the dismantling of jobkeeper and jobseeker subsidies that have kept millions of Australians solvent as the virus infected the economy and jobs disappeared. Echoing the evergreen “job snob” stereotypes the political right have used for decades to denigrate the unemployed – a tactic that handily terrifies waged workers into accepting lower salaries than they deserve – Morrison claimed providing liveable incomes to the unemployed dangerously disincentivised these people to work. His evidence, he admitted, was only “anecdotal”. Facts – conversely – tell a different story; specifically, that unemployment levels are only ever about the availability of jobs, which is why Switzerland, Norway, the Netherlands and Denmark maintain both generous dole provisions simultaneous to high employment. Presently, in Australia, there are but a rare few jobs left to get. In June, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported the pandemic’s grim impact; official stats compiled in May, showed a loss of 227,000 jobs in one month alone, 927,000 Australians unemployed and an unemployment rate of 7.1%. It’s their statistical sleight-of-hand to pretend a single hour of work in a fortnight is somehow enough to shuffle someone into the “employed” column, but coronavirus is causing even deft old players to drop their cards; the 3.3 million Australians receiving jobkeeper because their employers can’t afford to pay them aren’t considered “unemployed”. And if you’re among Australia’s army of casualised subcontractors, technically, you aren’t “looking for work” either; you’re hustling for clients. So what if there are none? There are 645,000 Australians in an arts and entertainment industry heavily casualised like this, and it’s been shuttered for months; only 20,000 of its workers met the strict year-at-the-same-job criteria of jobkeeper. That’s more than half a million Australians whose status hasn’t necessarily been caught by the ABS, and it’s just one industry among many hard hit. Hospitality, transport, tourism, media, events, universities, personal services and wide swathes of retail are haemorrhaging. The lovely couple who run a homewares shop around the corner from us sent out a sad message the other day that their business is closing; there are no longer enough customers to cover the bills. Are all devastated small business owners “job snobs” now, too, Scott Morrison? Unlike the prime minister, Australians grasp that reality trumps ideology. We know coronavirus is causing the shutdowns, the closed stadiums, grounded planes, cancelled weddings (mine), the stay-at-home orders, the business-as-anything-but-usual. Every new spike makes it clear; the choice coronavirus imposes on every human society is between safety or suffering. Joblessness does not result from an outbreak of laziness. It’s not a mass lack of gumption. Australia has seen enough shut shops and Centrelink queues to disbelieve the old beat-ups. So why is the prime minister restarting them? Neoliberals like his government are wedded to the economics of total market liberty, not responsible government enterprise. The need for economic stimulus screams for the government to lead direct job creation to stimulate consumer spending, but having bought themselves time with the jobkeeper provision to think through how to do it, the Liberals instead defaulted to ideological preferences. They are adamantly not intervening to save 5,000 jobs at Virgin Australia or 6,000 at Qantas. They have abandoned workers in remaining government enterprises and will not be saving 2,000 jobs at Australia Post, 50 at the CSIRO, 30 at the National Gallery or a boggling 30,000 jobs at Australia’s public universities. When questioned about job cuts announced at the ABC, Morrison actually smiled. The latest spending announcements from Morrison’s government are but theatricalised reminders about investments committed to long ago; like Malcolm Turnbull’s 2016 “Snowy 2.0” scheme, and defence spending that was itself reaffirmed last year. They will not come with an injection of extra jobs. There is no coordinated strategy. Economists are calling the impact of coronavirus a “Depression-level crisis”; it is stunning to consider the Liberal government refusing to remember the lessons of the Depression. Pandemic or not, sacked workers cannot furnish markets with spending, and neither can the workers without jobs to go back to when jobseeker payments are halved and jobkeeper taken away – scheduled for September. They won’t be spending big in the Laundy family’s 30 pubs. They’ll be fighting to keep their families together – nursing a bitter awareness of just who abandoned them, and for how little. • Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnist
52	We’re closing this blog now. But you can follow all the day’s developments at our new live blog here: We will close this live blog now, and take up our coverage on a new live blog shortly. My many thanks all for your company and correspondence. Be well. A summary of developments today. Covid-19 cases pass 10.6 million across the globe. There are now 10,644,064 confirmed cases worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker, with at least 514,527 deaths across 188 countries and regions. Brazil death toll passes 60,000. On Wednesday afternoon a coalition of Brazilian news outlets announced that the country’s total death toll had risen by 538 to 60,194, meaning it had doubled in the last month. Global tourism stands to lose up to $3.3tn from Covid-19. The US standing to lose the most - $538bn, or 3% of GDP - according to a UN study published on Wednesday Over 160,000 coronavirus cases reported every day in past week. The global coronavirus pandemic is accelerating, the World Health Organization said, pointing out that June saw more than half of all cases reported since the start of the pandemic. Oxford Covid-19 vaccine developers encouraged by immune response. A leading scientist behind the University of Oxford’s potential Covid-19 vaccine said the team has seen the right sort of immune response in trials, but declined to give a firm timeframe for when it could be ready. California closed down indoor bars, restaurants, cinemas and other facilities. The measures, which will be in place for three weeks, follow a surge in infections. Brazil restricts entry to foreigners due to Covid-19. The government will restrict the entry of foreigners to the country for 30 days due to the coronavirus pandemic. The World Health Organisation warns the Middle East is at a “critical threshold” with more than a million cases recorded across 22 countries. West Bank goes into lockdown as virus numbers soar. The Palestinian Authority has announced a five-day lockdown across the West Bank after the total confirmed coronavirus infections in the territory more than doubled following the easing of previous restrictions. NZ’s health minister, David Clark, has resigned, after a series of political missteps, and repeated breaches of his own government’s lockdown rules. Dr David Clark, NZ’s health minister since 2017, has made a series of political and and public blunders, even as his country has weathered the Covid-19 crisis remarkably well. First, during the height of New Zealand’s strict lockdodown regime, he was forced to apologise for breaching lockdown rules by going for a mountain bike ride. Three days later, he again apologised, this time to the prime minister, for taking a 20-kilometre drive to go for a beach walk. Last week, he face public opprobrium for blaming border quarantine errors at NZ’s director of health Ashley Bloomfield, while Dr Bloomfield was standing nearby. “I’ve made the call it is best for me to stand aside,” Clark said, saying he had become a distraction for the government in its effort to combat Covid-19. “It has been a privilege to serve in this role.” New Zealand has recorded only 1528 cases of Covid-19, with 22 deaths. The response here is very, very Australian. Some context: Melbourne, Australia’s second largest city, has seen a spike in community transmission cases (albeit from a very low base) so 10 suburbs across the city have been forced back into lockdown. But the measure has had some perverse outcomes, including in Summerhill Road, where one side of the street is locked down, the other is not. As our interlocutor here says: “what a stitch-up”. Good morning, day, or evening, wherever this coverage finds you. Ben Doherty here in Sydney. My many thanks to my colleagues Kevin Rawlinson et al for their stewardship thus far. The Middle East has recorded a million cases of Covid-19, and is at a “critical threshold”, the World Health Organisation has warned. The global health body confirmed on Sunday there were more than one million confirmed cases of the Covid-19 disease across the 22 countries that the WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean region covers, stretching from Morocco to Pakistan. Over 80% of all deaths in the region were reported in five countries: Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. “We are at a critical threshold in our region,” the WHO’s Middle East head, Ahmed al-Mandhari, said in an online press conference. Mandhari said it was a “concerning milestone”. “The number of cases reported in June alone is higher than the total number of cases reported during the four months following the first reported case in the region on 29 January,” he said. He attributed the rise in cases to increased testing, but also to the lifting in recent weeks of restrictions put in place to combat the virus’ spread. Colombia’s confirmed number of infections has tipped across the 100,000 case threshold, as the country’s quarantine measures roll on and intensive care units fill. They now number 102,009, the health ministry said, 54,941 of which are active. Some 3,470 people have died. Wednesday also marked the highest-ever daily increase in confirmed cases with an uptick of 4,163. Health experts are warning that young people of color face a growing threat from the coronavirus pandemic as young Americans drive record-setting coronavirus outbreaks in several US states. Data from the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) has shown the majority of coronavirus hospitalizations among Black and Latino Americans are of those under the age of 50. Dr Mary T Bassett, te director of the Center for Health and Human Rights at Harvard University and a former health commissioner for New York City’s health department, said: The risk is multifold because young people are more often susceptible to the same conditions that increase the risk of exposure, including working on the frontline. In the UK, the British Medical Association has criticised the government over reports that millions of items of personal protective equipment (PPE) were found to be faulty. The country’s Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has issued safety warnings, notices for disposal and distribution stoppages for some 85m masks and respirators, according to an investigation by Channel 4 News. The broadcaster reports that the masks and respirators were stored in the government’s pandemic stockpile and have been distributed to hospitals, care homes and GP surgeries since March. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the chairman of the British Medical Association (BMA) Council, said it was a “dereliction of duty” if healthcare workers had been supplied with faulty PPE during the epidemic. These reports, if true, are nothing short of a national scandal. If doctors and health and care workers have been supplied with, and worn, faulty, re-dated masks, this is clearly a dereliction of duty to ensure the safety of NHS staff and patients. Wearing substandard PPE places doctors at risk of becoming infected and also spreading the illness to patients. We know that doctors and healthcare staff have become infected and died from this virus and therefore nothing short of 100% fit for purpose PPE should have been supplied from the outset. A Department for Health and Social Care spokeswoman told the broadcaster: The quality of PPE released to the frontline is critically important to us. Rigorous checks were made to ensure products were safe before being distributed to the frontline and all products purchased for the stockpile in 2009 met the essential safety requirements required by law. As soon as we are alerted to any potential issues we take immediate action to ensure the safety of our health and care staff, and work to resolve those issues as quickly as possible. Nigeria will resume domestic flights from 8 July, the government has said, as Africa’s most populous country relaxes restrictions despite mounting cases and deaths. The airports for the capital Abuja and Lagos will open that day, while a handful of others are set to open three days later and the rest after another four days, the government said on its official Twitter account. No date was given for the resumption of international flights. Nigeria had confirmed more than 25,000 cases and almost 600 deaths as of Wednesday, with little sign of the outbreak slowing. Officials have expressed their concern that the outbreak there might become much worse. Yet the government is keenly aware of the economic toll, which has crushed the price of oil, on which Nigeria depends. Officials have steadily eased measures aimed at curbing the outbreak, believing the economic damage of a stringent lockdown could be worse than the harm done by the pandemic. Crucial data that could help prevent fresh local waves of coronavirus is being withheld from some of the parts of England most in danger of further lockdowns, Robert Booth, Dan Sabbagh, Heather Stewart and Ashley Kirk write. Council leaders have told the Guardian they are either not getting test results needed to prevent new outbreaks, or the results were incomplete and without sufficient detail to allow them to quell local surges in infection. The complaints come as Labour accuse the UK prime minister Boris Johnson of presiding over a “lost week” that has let the virus spread, threatening fresh lockdowns as physical distancing restrictions are loosened this weekend. The government hit back, claiming councils had the information they needed to keep the virus at bay. Here’s a summary of the latest news: Covid-19 cases pass 10.5 million across the globe. There are now 10,501,482 confirmed cases worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker, with at least 511,909 deaths across 188 countries and regions. Brazil death toll passes 60,000. On Wednesday afternoon a coalition of Brazilian news outlets announced that the country’s total death toll had risen by 538 to 60,194, meaning it had doubled in the last month. Global tourism stands to lose up to $3.3tn from Covid-19. The US standing to lose the most - $538bn, or 3% of GDP - according to a UN study published on Wednesday Over 160,000 coronavirus cases reported every day in past week. The global coronavirus pandemic is accelerating, the World Health Organization said, pointing out that June saw more than half of all cases reported since the start of the pandemic. Oxford Covid-19 vaccine developers encouraged by immune response. A leading scientist behind the University of Oxford’s potential Covid-19 vaccine said the team has seen the right sort of immune response in trials, but declined to give a firm timeframe for when it could be ready. California closed down indoor bars, restaurants, cinemas and other facilities. The measures, which will be in place for three weeks, follow a surge in infections. Ryanair pilots agree to 20% pay cut in attempt to limit job losses. The pilots’ union Balpa announced 96% of its Ryanair members had voted to accept the temporary pay cut as part of efforts to avoid up to 3,000 job cuts at Europe’s biggest budget airline. Brazil restricts entry to foreigners due to Covid-19. The government will restrict the entry of foreigners to the country for 30 days due to the coronavirus pandemic. West Bank goes into lockdown as virus numbers soar. The Palestinian Authority has announced a five-day lockdown across the West Bank after the total confirmed coronavirus infections in the territory more than doubled following the easing of previous restrictions. Israel’s parliament has voted to allow the country’s domestic intelligence agency to track the cellphones of coronavirus carriers for the next three weeks amid a resurgence in new cases, Reuters reports. The Shin Bet surveillance technology has been used on and off to track carriers since March, when the prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet circumvented parliament and approved the program through emergency regulations as cases first spiked. Those emergency measures drew challenges from privacy watchdog groups and the supreme court cited worries over dangers to individual liberty in demanding Netanyahu’s government regulate the surveillance through legislation. The new law allows the Shin Bet to access carriers’ phone location data for 14 days before they were diagnosed. That data is used to identify anyone they came into contact with, which proponents say is crucial to identify new cases. Indoor activities at bars, restaurants, cinemas and other facilities will be banned in most of the US state of California for at least three weeks as infections surge, its governor Gavin Newsom has announced. The UN Security Council has finally backed the UN chief Antonio Guterres’ 23 March call for a global truce amid the pandemic, adopting a resolution after months of talks to win a compromise between the United States and China, Reuters reports. The resolution, drafted by France and Tunisia, calls for “all parties to armed conflicts to engage immediately in a durable humanitarian pause for at least 90 consecutive days” to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid. Negotiations were stymied by a standoff between China and the US over whether to urge support for the World Health Organization (WHO). The latter country did not want a reference to the global health body, while the former did. The US president Donald Trump said in May that Washington would quit the Geneva-based agency over its handling of the pandemic, accusing it of being “China-centric” and promoting China’s “disinformation”. The WHO denies the claims. The resolution does not mention the WHO explicitly, but does reference a UN General Assembly resolution that does. Richard Gowan, International Crisis Group UN director, said: We have really seen the body at its worst. This is a dysfunctional security council. The pandemic is exacerbating inequality throughout the world by hitting hardest those without a social safety net in developing countries while central bank asset purchases in advanced countries benefit the richest, the World Bank president David Malpass has said. During a webcast event hosted by the Council of the Americas, he warned of a “catastrophe” for the developing world that will bring long-term damage and global economic output would not recover to its pre-pandemic level for years. The US has suffered 560 more deaths and registered another 43,644 cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said, taking the respective totals to 127,299 and 2,624,873. Covid-19 cases pass 10.5 million across the globe. There are now 10,501,482 confirmed cases worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker, with at least 511,909 deaths across 188 countries and regions. Brazil death toll passes 60,000.

West Bank goes into lockdown as virus numbers soar. The Palestinian Authority has announced a five-day lockdown across the West Bank after the total confirmed coronavirus infections in the territory more than doubled following the easing of previous restrictions. Alitalia has resumed international flights from Milan as Italy gradually reopens its airports to foreign travellers and scraps restrictions imposed to contain the outbreak. The carrier, which is in the process of being nationalised after 11 years of troubled private management, will fly from Milan Malpensa airport to Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris and London. France has suffered 18 more deaths, taking its overall total to 29,861, its health department has said. That figure is in line with the daily average of 18 seen over the last week. In May, France counted 143 additional deaths every day on average. This decrease has allowed the government to gradually reopen businesses, restaurants and some schools since 11 May. Brazil has just passed yet another grim Covid-19 milestone with confirmation that more than 60,000 lives have been lost since mid-March. On Wednesday afternoon a coalition of Brazilian news outlets announced that the country’s total death toll had risen by 538 to 60,194, meaning it had doubled in the last month. The number of confirmed infections rose to 1.42 million after 18,428 new cases were reported. That places Brazil behind only the US in terms of both the total number of deaths and cases. There was no immediate comment from Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has faced domestic and international condemnation for his handling of the crisis. Egypt restarted international flights and reopened major tourist attractions including the Great Pyramids of Giza on Wednesday after over three months of closure due to the coronavirus pandemic. The country closed its airports to scheduled international flights and shut famous historical sites in mid-March as the government looked to curb the spread of the virus. That brought the tourist industry, which the government says accounts for 5% of economic output but which analysts say may account for as much as 15% if jobs and investment indirectly related to the industry are included, to a virtual halt. The health ministry has registered 68,311 cases of the coronavirus and 2,953 deaths. The Palestinian Authority has announced a five-day lockdown across the West Bank after the total confirmed coronavirus infections in the territory more than doubled following the easing of previous restrictions. “Starting from Friday morning, all governorates of the West Bank... will be closed for a period of five days,” government spokesman Ibrahim Melhem said, adding that pharmacies, bakeries and supermarkets were exempt. The latest data from the Palestinian ministry of health said that as of Wednesday morning, a total of 2,636 people had tested positive for Covid-10, compared with just 1,256 a week ago. Last week, after the easing of a previous coronavirus lockdown in late May, Palestinian health minister Mai al-Kaila said the territory had entered a second wave of infections “more dangerous than the first”. Most infections were traceable to Palestinians working in Israel or Arab Israeli visitors to the West Bank, Kaila said. There have been seven deaths from the virus in the territory. Israel has also recorded a surge, with 25,547 confirmed cases on Wednesday morning, up around 15% from a week earlier. The Palestinian Authority imposed a full West Bank lockdown after the first coronavirus cases were identified on 5 March, lifting it at the end of May. French MPs have voted to grant a tax credit to anyone taking out a new subscription to a current affairs newspaper or magazine after the government argued that the sector was “suffering enormously” from the coronavirus crisis. Deputies voted to allow a one-off deduction of up to €50 (£45) to households subscribing for the first time, and for at least 12 months, to a newspaper, magazine or online news service “providing news of a general or political character”. News publishers around the world have been hit hard by the crisis, hindered from printing, distributing or selling paper copies and devastated by a collapse in advertising revenues while obliged to continue paying fixed costs such as office rents and staffing. US newspapers are said to be facing an “extinction-level” crisis. Several countries are looking at ways to support their ailing news sectors, particularly local press. Canada, for example, is considering raising the tax credit on digital news subscriptions from 15% to 50% in an effort to encourage more people to support media outlets. France’s state secretary for economic affairs, Agnès Pannier-Runacher, said the measure reflected “an undertaking by the president to support the press, which is suffering enormously and not necessarily benefiting from all sorts of aid” available to other sectors of the economy. Doctors treating coronavirus patients in Sierra Leone will go on strike within 24 hours after the government failed to pay promised allowances, their union said on Wednesday. The Sierra Leone Medical and Dental Association (SLMDA) said in a statement the strike would continue until the allowances are paid in full, without specifying how much the doctors are owed. “That could be in five hours or five months. But we won’t settle for anything less than the full backlog of weekly payments for the last three months,” Samba Jalloh, SLMDA’s secretary general, told Reuters. Doctors treating patients for conditions other than Covid-19 will continue to show up to work, it said. A spokesman for the Sierra Leone’s coronavirus response team had previously told Reuters that the government was carrying out an audit of health workers to verify those that are directly involved in the Covid-19 response. The union also complained that a memorandum of understanding between the government and doctors working in Covid-19 isolation and treatment centres expired on Tuesday and has not been renewed. Jalloh said: They’ve continuously said that these payments would come once they verified our ranks, but no progress was ever made. But we never breached our part of the contract, despite few PPEs (personal protective equipment), medicine shortages and other issues. Sierra Leone has recorded 1,462 cases of the virus, including 60 deaths, far fewer than many other West African countries despite its fragile health infrastructure. The association said two doctors have died of Covid-19 related causes since the outbreak, while more than 100 health workers have also been infected. Health workers in Sierra Leone went on strike several times during the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak, which killed nearly 4,000 people in the country including around 250 medical workers. The World Health Organization has warned the Middle East faces a “critical threshold” amid a relaxation of coronavirus measures, following a surge in cases in the region. The global health body confirmed on Sunday there were more than one million cases of Covid-19 across the 22 countries that the WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean region covers, stretching from Morocco to Pakistan. Over 80% of all deaths in the region were reported in five countries: Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, according to the WHO. The WHO’s Middle East head, Ahmed al-Mandhari, said it was a “concerning milestone”, adding: “We are at a critical threshold in our region.” The number of cases reported in June alone is higher than the total number of cases reported during the four months following the first reported case in the region on 29 January. He attributed the rise in cases to increased testing, but also to the lifting in recent weeks of restrictions put in place to combat the virus’ spread. He urged individuals to be “cautious and vigilant” as lockdowns and curfews were eased, and to follow protocols recommended by health authorities. “Easing of lockdowns does not mean easing of the response or easing of social responsibilities,” he said, adding there was a risk the number of cases will rise as public spaces reopen “even in countries where the situation now seems to be stabilising”. Textile factories that operated normally at the height of the coronavirus pandemic could be responsible for a fresh lockdown in Leicester, central England, a report has claimed. The city on Tuesday became the first in the country to see localised two-week restrictions imposed because of a spike in cases, just days before a planned easing of restrictions. Labour Behind the Label, which campaigns for the rights of textile workers, claimed in a report that some factories in Leicester operated at full capacity throughout the crisis. It added it was “inconceivable” they would have been able to do so and still follow social distancing rules and proper Covid-19 protection measures. The report alleged that textile workers were pressured into working, in one case when a staff member had tested positive for the virus. Furlough wage payments from the government were in some instances kept by bosses rather than passed on to workers, it added. “Allegations of abuse at many Leicester companies have been reported for years now,” said Labour Behind the Label’s Dominique Muller. A parliamentary report last year suggested there are as many 1,000 garment factories operating in the English east Midlands city, which has one of the Britain’s most diverse populations. Labour Behind The Label accused major retail brands, including Boohoo, which it said accounted for 75% of clothing production in the city, of doing little to monitor conditions at factories. The global coronavirus pandemic is accelerating, the World Health Organization has said, pointing out that June saw more than half of all cases reported since the start of the pandemic. “For the past week, the number of the new cases has exceeded 160,000 on every single day,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual briefing. Sixty percent of all cases so far have been reported just in the past month. With over 511,000 deaths and more than 10.5 million known infections worldwide, the coronavirus pandemic is “not even close to being over”, the WHO warned earlier this week. Tedros reiterated that taking a “comprehensive approach” was the best way to rein in the virus. Countries that have implemented a wide range of measures, including contact tracing, isolation, physical distancing and mask wearing “have suppressed transmission and saved lives”, he said. The UN health agency was therefore very concerned, he said, to see that a number of countries “have not used all the tools at their disposal and have taken a fragmented approach. “These countries face a long, hard road ahead,” he said. He stressed that while the pandemic posed a scientific challenge, “it’s also a test of character”. Iraq’s official coronavirus death toll has surpassed 2,000, as the war-ravaged country’s crippled healthcare system struggles to cope. Health authorities announced there were now 51,524 cases of the Covid-19 disease in the country and that 2,050 people had died of the virus, while 26,267 people had recovered. Iraq, which has recorded cases in all of its 18 provinces but mainly in Baghdad - a city of 10 million people - said it has carried out 556,000 tests since March. But due to decades of chronic shortages of doctors, medicines and hospital beds, the country has relied heavily on aid from abroad to continue testing its population. According to the World Health Organization, there are 14 hospital beds per 10,000 inhabitants in Iraq - compared to 60 in France, for example - and the oil-rich country devotes just 1.8% of its budget to health. Hospitals across the country have been overwhelmed over recent weeks by a jump in cases and deaths, following months of the virus spreading relatively slowly. Doctors in coronavirus wards have complained of a lack of personal protective equipment and say they have been made to keep working even if they showed symptoms of infection. Hundreds of Covid-19 cases have been recorded in their ranks. Despite the rise in infections, authorities are refusing to reimpose a full lockdown in an effort to revive the economy. A leading scientist behind the University of Oxford’s potential Covid-19 vaccine said the team has seen the right sort of immune response in trials, but declined to give a firm timeframe for when it could be ready. Speaking at a parliamentary hearing, Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the university, said 8,000 volunteers had been enrolled for Phase III of its trial into the vaccine, AZD1222, which was licensed to AstraZeneca. She said: We’re very happy that we’re seeing the right sort of immune response that will give protection, and not the wrong sort. The project has started Phase III of the human trials to assess how the vaccine works in a large number of people over the age of 18. The race is on to develop a working Covid-19 vaccine, with fears that the pandemic could re-intensify towards the end of the year, in the northern hemisphere’s winter season. Kate Bingham, chair of the UK Government Vaccine Taskforce, said that, excluding the Oxford vaccine programme, she hoped there would be a breakthrough by early 2021. Gilbert said she hoped that her Oxford vaccine would make progress earlier, but was not more specific as she said the timeline for when the vaccine might be ready depends on the results of the trial. John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, said that Britain should prepare for not having a Covid-19 vaccine for the winter and encourage people to get their flu vaccinations to avoid “pandemonium” in hospitals. This whole epidemic has relied too heavily on assumptions that have turned out not to be true. So my strong advice is to be prepared for the worst. Americans’ anxieties over the spread of the coronavirus are at the highest in more than a month, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed, as California recorded its biggest single-day spike in cases since the pandemic began. With the US death toll at more than 127,000, by far the highest in the world, the 29-30 June poll found that 81% of American adults said they are “very” or “somewhat” concerned about the pandemic, the most since a similar poll conducted 11-12 May. The centre of the US pandemic has moved from the northeast to the west and south, especially California, Texas, Florida and Arizona. Bill de Blasio, the mayor of hard-hit New York City, said on Wednesday he was not going ahead with a plan to allow indoor restaurant dining from 6 July, citing the alarming situation elsewhere. We see a lot of problems and we particularly see problems revolving around people going back to bars and restaurants indoors, and indoors is the problem more and more. Public health officials believe the decision to reopen bars in many states was one of the main contributors to the sharp increases. Several states have since moved to re-close them. Cases in California rose by 8,441 on Tuesday as the United States recorded it biggest one-day increase of nearly 48,000 new infections, a Reuters tally showed. Concerns about the pandemic appear to be rising the most among members of president Donald Trump’s Republican Party, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll. Republicans have generally been less enthusiastic about imposing and maintaining restrictions to stop the spread of the virus such as sheltering at home or wearing face masks, turning the public safety measures into a partisan issue. About seven in 10 Republicans said they were personally concerned about the virus’ spread, up from six in 10 Republicans in polls conducted over the past few weeks. Trump officials have blamed the surge in cases on increased testing, but the rise in the percentage of people testing positive and in hospitalisations are not linked to more tests being conducted. Three states with at least 500 total deaths - Arizona, Louisiana and Texas - have seen the rate of fatalities increase for two weeks or more. Deaths in Arizona rose 63% in the week ended 28 June, one of the largest increases in the country. In parts of Texas and Arizona, hospital intensive care beds for Covid-19 patients are also in short supply. With limited guidance from the White House, the pandemic fight has largely been left to local officials, and the pressure to re-open their economies has been enormous. Millions have lost their jobs as the economy contracted sharply in the first quarter and is expected to crater in the second. But when asked in the latest poll about the “most important factor” determining their vote in November, 27% of respondents said it was the candidate’s plan to help the nation recover from the coronavirus, compared with 21% who said it was the candidate’s plan to create jobs and boost the economy. After months in self-isolation, he’s back. Vladimir Lenin, embalmed and entombed, has reopened to the Russian public, luring bold tourists back to Red Square and down a steep set of mausoleum stairs to his resting place for most of the last 96 years. From early on Wednesday morning, a queue of dozens of people stretched around the mausoleum, past the Kremlin walls and up to the red-bricked historical museum. To see the preserved corpse of the former Soviet leader you must wear a mask, gloves, and pass a temperature check. Inside, visitors reported a pungent smell of cleaning solution, perhaps due to a recent sanitisation. Coming after a three-month break due to the coronavirus pandemic, attendance was subdued. “I’ve never seen the queue so short,” said one young mother, who was taking her daughter and friends from out of town for the first time. It is joked of as a tourist trap. “Muscovites never come here without visitors [from out of town].” The reopening is another sign that life is getting back to normal in Russia, if normal means displaying a leader who died in 1924 in a glass case to tourists. The UK may find it hard to obtain stocks of remdesivir, one of two drugs shown to work in treating Covid-19, over the coming months, deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam told the science and technology select committee of the House of Commons. The UK had stocks it bought for clinical trials, which the NHS is currently still using, he said. But asked whether it would be so easy to get more, following the deal done by president Trump to buy up almost all the stocks made by the manufacturer Gilead from July to September, Van Tam said it would not. The deputy CMO side-stepped the politics, contrasting remdesivir with dexamethasone, the one drug shown to save lives, which is very easy to obtain because it is cheap and widely available all over the world. He said: No - I don’t think it [remdesivir] will be as easy or straightforward to obtain as the measures we took for dexamethasone, by virtue of its scarcity and the fact that it is a new medicine with a relatively long manufacturing time. But remdesivir would not be suitable for all patients, because it is an intravenous drug and cannot be used in the later stages of the disease, he said. The drug has so far only been shown to shorten the course of the disease, so patients recover sooner. But Van Tam said it was possible remdesivir could also have an effect on survival. The US government has secured 100% of the drug being made in July and 90% due to be produced in August and September. The US has issued emergency use authorisation for Kroger’s at-home sample collection kit for Covid-19, according to a report by Reuters. The kits will be available to frontline workers across its companies beginning this week, Kroger said, adding that it plans to expand availability to other companies in the coming weeks, with a goal of processing up to 60,000 tests per week by the end of July. Kroger said the nasal swab sample needs to be performed under the supervision of a licensed healthcare professional through video chat and will be shipped overnight to a designated laboratory for processing. Most results will be confirmed in less than 72 hours, the company said. While self-sample collection helps reduce patient traffic at hospitals and minimise chances of infection for healthcare workers, experts have flagged concerns about whether patients can accurately collect samples on their own and ship them to labs. The FDA in April authorised for emergency use the first Covid-19 diagnostic kit by LabCorp with at-home collection of nasal swab samples which are then sent to the company’s labs for testing. The US has been criticised by health experts for buying up nearly the entire global supply of remdesivir, the only drug licensed so far to treat Covid-19. AP reports: Ohid Yaqub, a senior lecturer at the University of Sussex, called the move disappointing news. It so clearly signals an unwillingness to cooperate with other countries and the chilling effect this has on international agreements about intellectual property rights, Yaqub said in a statement. Dr. Peter Horby, who is running a large clinical trial testing several treatments for COVID-19, told the BBC that a stronger framework was needed to ensure fair prices and access to key medicines for people and nations around the world. He said that as an American company, Gilead was likely under certain political pressures locally. The criticism follows Guardian health editor Sarah Boseley’s story that the US has bought up virtually all the stocks of remdesivir for the next three months. She writes: Experts and campaigners are alarmed both by the US unilateral action on remdesivir and the wider implications, for instance in the event of a vaccine becoming available. The Trump administration has already shown that it is prepared to outbid and outmanoeuvre all other countries to secure the medical supplies it needs for the US. “They’ve got access to most of the drug supply [of remdesivir], so there’s nothing for Europe,” said Dr Andrew Hill, senior visiting research fellow at Liverpool University. Read more below The UK’s Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said 43,906 people had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus as of 5pm on Tuesday, up by 176 from 43,730 the day before The UK’s government figures do not include all deaths involving Covid-19 across the UK, which are thought to have passed 54,000, PA Media reports. The DHSC also said in the 24-hour period up to 9am on Wednesday, 226,398 tests were carried out or dispatched, with 829 positive results. Overall, a total of 9,662,051 tests have been carried out and 313,483 cases have been confirmed positive. The figure for the number of people tested has been “temporarily paused to ensure consistent reporting” across all methods of testing. Hello, I’m Aamna taking over the liveblog while Jessica has lunch. If you want to get in touch, you can email me (aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com) or tweet me (@aamnamohdin) Ryanair pilots have agreed to take a 20% pay cut as part of efforts to avoid up to 3,000 job cuts at Europe’s biggest budget airline. The pilots’ union Balpa announced on Wednesday that 96% of its Ryanair members had voted to accept the temporary pay cut in order to “save jobs that were under threat” due to the collapse in demand for flights in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. Brian Strutton, Balpa’s general secretary said: This is a terrible time for aviation and for employees in all airlines. It was our members’ mandate for us to save as many jobs as possible. In the circumstances this is the right thing to do even if it means accepting difficult temporary reductions in pay. The pilots agreed to the pay cut deal hours after Ryanair’s chief executive, Michael O’Leary, made public an ultimatum that a total of 3,000 job losses could only be avoided if all staff agreed to pay cuts. There are now 10,501,482 confirmed cases of the coronavirus worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker. The virus has killed at least 511,909 people across 188 countries and regions, the data shows. The tally likely only reflects a fraction of the actual number of infections, with many countries testing only symptomatic or the most serious cases. The US continues to be the worst-hit country with 127,425 deaths from 2,636,538 cases. After the US, the hardest-hit countries are Brazil with 59,594 deaths from 1,402,041 cases, the United Kingdom with 43,815 deaths from 314,162 cases, Italy with 34,767 deaths from 240,578 cases, and France with 29,846 deaths from 202,063 cases. China has to date declared 84,813 cases, including 4,641 deaths. Wearing a facemask on public transport will become compulsory in Switzerland, following a resurgence in Covid-19 cases in a country that had largely got the virus under control. The landlocked country fully reopened its borders on 15 June and said the rise in cases was due to infected people entering the country, as it imposed 10-day quarantine measures on new arrivals from countries deemed to pose a risk. The number of cases in Switzerland had been at a low and stable level for weeks but began to tick upwards in the second half of June as it lifted most of its remaining lockdown restrictions. “Given the increasing use of public transport and the increase in cases since mid-June, the government decided to make wearing a mask mandatory on public transport,” the government said in a statement. The rule will apply from Monday to people aged 12 and above. Switzerland said on Wednesday that 31,768 people in total had tested positive for the coronavirus - up 137 in the last 24 hours, the biggest jump since April. Only 843 new cases were registered in the whole of June. The Alpine nation, with a population 8.5 million, has registered 1,684 deaths due to the virus. Luxury British department store Harrods said it plans to cut up to 672 jobs because of the coronavirus crisis, which kept its flagship branch in central London closed for nearly three months. Harrods, which is owned by the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), told staff it needed to shed up to 14% of its total workforce of 4,800. Employees affected will primarily be in parts of the business that have been worst hit by the lockdown. Chief executive Michael Ward warned it would take a drastic improvement in external conditions for Harrods’ business to recover and return to growth. The necessary social distancing requirements to protect employees and customers is having a huge impact on our ability to trade, while the devastation in international travel has meant we have lost key customers coming to our store. Global tourism revenues are expected to fall by up to $3.3tn due to Covid-19 restrictions, with the US standing to lose the most, according to a UN study published on Wednesday. The Covid-19 and Tourism report released by The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) is based on three scenarios for the industry, with lockdown measures lasting four months, eight months and 12 months. In those scenarios, revenues would fall $1.17tn, $2.22tn and $3.3tn respectively or between 1.5-4.2% of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP). The report did not say which scenario was most likely, although an UNCTAD official said the middle scenario “could be a realistic one”. The report said: International tourism has been almost totally suspended, and domestic tourism curtailed by lockdown conditions imposed in many countries. Although some destinations have started slowly to open up, many are afraid of international travel or cannot afford it due to the economic crisis. The US incurs the highest losses in all three scenarios, with a $187bn drop in the one lasting just four months, followed by China with $105bn. Thailand and France also stand to lose approximately $47bn each. Small island states such as Jamaica stand to suffer big losses in proportion to their economies, facing an 11% fall in GDP or $1.68bn. The US loss in the “pessimistic” scenario is $538bn, or 3% of GDP. The UNCTAD report covers 65 individual countries and regions. It calls for governments to boost social protection for affected workers in badly-hit nations. Some of the estimates are comparable to those in a previous UN report by its World Tourism Organization in May, which found that tourism numbers could fall by 60-80% compared with 66% in UNCTAD’s intermediate scenario. The Italian head of the Red Cross has accused Brazil’s president Jair Bolsonaro of “underestimating” the coronavirus pandemic with “very, very sad” consequences. Speaking to journalists in Geneva on Wednesday – with Brazil’s death toll poised to rise above 60,000 – Francesco Rocca said his organisation viewed what was happening in the South American country “with concern”. “It is a very difficult situation … Unfortunately, Bolsonaro I think underestimated the consequences of the Covid-19 in his country and we are living the consequences,” he told the Brazilian journalist Jamil Chade. Rocca added: It is very, very sad. It is the perfect example of when the economy is given priority over the lives of human beings. Bolsonaro is facing domestic and international condemnation for what is widely seen as his reckless handling of a pandemic that has now killed 59,656 people, according to a coalition of Brazilian news groups keeping an independent tally. On Tuesday, 1,271 deaths were reported, meaning Brazil’s total is likely to exceed 60,000 today. Only in the US have more deaths been recorded. Despite this, Bolsonaro has urged the reopening of the economy, claiming the “side-effects” of shutdowns cannot be allowed to be more severe than Covid-19’s impact on public health. A study released by one of Brazil’s top pollsters on Tuesday showed that nearly half of Brazilians disapproved of Bolsonaro’s reaction to the coronavirus, which he has dismissed as a “bit of a cold”. About 30% of the population continues to support him. Rocca said political divisions had also contributed to the scale of Brazil’s crisis. I think that one of the lessons learned of this pandemic is that politicians should learn to speak with one voice. Politicians should start to follow the advice coming from the scientific community. The Kazakh government has proposed starting a second lockdown from 5 July and maintaining it for at least two weeks, president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said, after a sharp rise in new cases. Tokayev said on Twitter a special commission would review the plan on 2 July and then lay out its details. Tokayev ordered his cabinet this week to urgently tighten the restrictions after the number of Covid-19 cases surged more than sevenfold following the lifting of the first lockdown in mid-May. A dip in airline bookings in the second half of June give grounds for caution about the prospects for the industry in the coming months as Covid-19 cases start to spike again in certain countries, the chief economist of airline body IATA said. Brian Pearce said that while June had on average been been better than the month before, the second half of the month had seen a drop in bookings, and that prolonged travel restrictions to the US or Latin America could hit its base case forecast for the year. “There was a dip in bookings in the second half of June, as coronavirus cases picked up … This is causing us to be rather cautious about prospects in the next few months,” he said. Scotland’s national bard Robert Burns wrote that the Highland welcome was such that he’d ask no more on entering heaven. But with only 114 coronavirus deaths to date, residents of this vast area – which swiftly isolated in March – are equivocal about an influx of visitors as the Scottish tourism sector reopens on 15 July. The homemade “tourists go home” signs that appeared at the start of lockdown to deter isolation tourists may have been removed, but Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, this week acknowledged she could not rule out quarantining or screening travellers from England if infection rates rise south of the border. While tourism bosses warn of threatened cancellations, the Guardian has spoken to residents, businesses and community leaders across the Highlands, whose anxiety and ambivalence is palpable. Germany takes over the European Union’s six-month presidency on Wednesday, with outgoing chancellor Angela Merkel staking her legacy on a massive economic recovery plan to help the bloc with the coronavirus fallout. Merkel’s last major role on the international stage comes as the 27-member club faces its deepest recession since the second world war, triggered by a pandemic that has killed more than 500,000 people globally. The crisis has galvanised Europe’s most powerful leader who, with just over a year left in her final term, has ditched her usual wait-and-see approach to call for “extraordinary measures” to weather the storm. “Europe’s future is our future,” Merkel said on Monday as she stood beside French president Emmanuel Macron to push for a €750bn ($843bn) coronavirus recovery fund. The proposed fund would controversially be financed through shared EU borrowing, which marks a stunning U-turn for Germany after years of opposition to debt pooling. The EU’s rotating presidency is Merkel’s “last chance” to make her mark as one of Europe’s great leaders, Der Spiegel weekly wrote. “For years the chancellor put off dealing with the chronic problems of the EU and the euro. Now, towards the end of her political career, she has the opportunity to make up for past mistakes,” Spiegel wrote. There will be no shortage of challenges to tackle in the months ahead. Post-Brexit negotiations, a more assertive China, rocky transatlantic ties, climate change and the conflict in Libya will all be jostling for attention, even if the pandemic promises to dominate the agenda. Northern Ireland’s first minister called on her deputy to apologise for undermining coronavirus restrictions at the funeral of a member of her Sinn Féin party and ex-Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoner that attracted large crowds. The British region’s devolved executive, led by Sinn Féin and its rival Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), allowed up to 30 people at funerals from Monday, including some friends but only when no household or family members of the deceased were there. Deputy first minister Michelle O’Neill of Sinn Féin, party president Mary Lou McDonald, former party leader Gerry Adams, and the party’s deputy in the Irish republic Pearse Doherty, were all at Tuesday’s funeral in Belfast for Bobby Storey. Images from the funeral show Storey’s relatives present and large numbers of mourners on streets nearby. First minister Arlene Foster told BBC Radio Ulster: It is quite intolerable now that people think that there are some people to whom the law doesn’t apply and that indeed there are some politicians who are saying: ‘Do as I say but not as I do.’ She needs to apologise, she needs to recognise the wrong that has been done and also absolutely needs to make amends. Northern Ireland’s power-sharing government was restored in January after a three-year standoff between Sinn Féin and the DUP that threatened part of a 1998 peace pact. Doherty told Irish national broadcaster RTE that thousands lined the streets after the church service, but that the cortege was limited to 30 and others were urged to keep distance. While the presence of crowds was “obviously of a concern”, Doherty added that he would not recommend anyone to self-isolate, just as he would not encourage people who went to the supermarket to quarantine. Other parties, north and south of the Irish border, joined the criticism. “Many families have endured burying a loved one alone, to help save lives. When those who make the rules, break the rules, it is more hurtful still,” tweeted Northern Ireland justice minister Naomi Long of the Alliance Party. In Portugal’s capital city of Lisbon, the mayor’s office has put up posters amid an uptick in cases and reports of parties that have attracted as many as 1,000 revellers. “You know who also never misses an illegal party? The virus,” the posters read. In June, the country of 10.3 million people recorded 9,441 confirmed cases, according to the health ministry – an average of 314 new cases a day. Portugal’s per capita rate of new infections now ranks among the highest in Europe, second only to Sweden. The government has responded by introducing restrictions in the Greater Lisbon area. Starting today, in 19 of the 118 parishes in the Lisbon metropolitan area, residents have been ordered to stay in their homes, allowed out only for food or medicine or to travel to work, play sports or care for vulnerable family members. Gatherings are limited to five people in these areas, compared with a 20-person limit in most of the country. Initially hailed for its rapid response to the virus, the Portuguese government has pointed to widespread testing to explain the rise in new cases, with an average of 98,000 new tests carried out weekly. The number of lives claimed by the virus remains relatively low in the country, with 1,576 deaths. On Wednesday, António Costa, the prime minister of Portugal, and his Spanish counterpart, Pedro Sánchez, reopened the shared border to travellers, bringing an end to a closure that stretched more than three months. “I can’t give you a hug,” Sánchez said apologetically as the mask-clad prime ministers greeted each other. Dutch brothels, including Amsterdam’s red light district, reopened on Wednesday after a long coronavirus shutdown, with sex workers and clients having to observe new rules to prevent infection. The Netherlands ordered all sex clubs to close in mid-March and had originally planned to keep them closed until September, but recently brought the date forward as Covid-19 cases dropped. “I’m totally booked” for Wednesday, Foxxy, a sex worker and activist at the Prostitution Information Center in Amsterdam, told AFP using her professional pseudonym. “I had a little party when I heard” [the announcement that sex work could restart], said Foxxy, who rents a room in a brothel outside the red light district. Everybody is so relieved that we can go back to work again because a lot of sex workers didn’t get any benefits from the government. So it’s really nice to be making money again. While less restrictive than other countries, the Netherlands’ “intelligent lockdown” emptied the red neon-lit, street-front windows from which many of Amsterdam’s sex workers normally beckon customers. Now they are reopening but, as with Dutch hairdressers and masseurs which have already been allowed to resume operations, sex workers are encouraged to verify their clients do not have Covid-19 symptoms. “Before I make an appointment, I have to check with the client if they’re feeling OK and if they don’t have any of the symptoms, or if any of their housemates has symptoms,” Foxxy said. Lithuania has issued a new collector’s coin to mark the coronavirus crisis, bearing the inscription: “After darkness, I hope for light”. The coin features rays of light illuminating the year 2020 while the perspective shadow of the date forms the international distress signal SOS. Asta Kuniyoshi, deputy governor of Lithuania’s central bank, said the bank came up with the idea in March when the Baltic eurozone member imposed a lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus. She told AFP: At the height of the pandemic we witnessed solidarity between people. So the coin marks not only the lockdown period but also the universal human values of hope, unity and solidarity. With this coin we also pay tribute to medics and all the other people who helped during the pandemic, from volunteers who assisted the elderly to teachers who taught kids online. Thousands of silver €5 coins, as well coins in copper and nickel with a nominal value of €1.50, are now available online and in a number of shops across the country. The bank minted 2,500 €5 coins and 30,000 of a €1.50 version. The country of 2.8 million inhabitants has now eased most of the anti-virus restrictions imposed from mid-March. Lithuania reported one new case of the coronavirus on Wednesday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 1,818, including 78 deaths – much lower than in most other EU countries. The Spanish government is working with Airbus to keep jobs in the country, prime minister Pedro Sanchez has said, a day after the aerospace giant announced it would cut 15,000 jobs as part of a global restructuring. Speaking to journalists after the reopening of Spain’s border with Portugal, Sanchez highlighted the country’s role in the founding of Airbus and said he hoped to find solutions to retain some jobs. Macy’s has reported a staggering $3.58bn loss for the coronavirus-hit quarter, as shutdowns resulted in the department store chain recording a $3bn impairment charge. The pandemic has forced brick-and-mortar retailers to tap credit lines, lay off employees and suspend dividends and buybacks in a bid to stay afloat. Macy’s, which also owns Bloomingdale’s, said net sales for the first quarter ended 2 May, nearly halved to $3.02bn. “While our stores are re-opened, we expect that the Covid-19 pandemic will continue to impact the country for the remainder of the year,” chief executive officer Jeff Gennette said in a statement. On a per share basis, it reported a net loss of $11.53 in the first quarter ended 2 May, compared with a profit of 44 cents a year earlier. Macy’s results comes as some of its peers, including J Crew, J.C. Penney and Neiman Marcus Group, filed for bankruptcy after failing to cope with market uncertainties and mounting debt. Major sports events working to get back up and running after the coronavirus crisis are likely to have to do so without cancellation insurance for communicable diseases, as insurers remove cover or ramp up the cost. Although the Wimbledon tennis championships will be covered by an existing pandemic policy after this week’s event was cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak, its organisers say it will not be able to get similar cover next year. “All the policies that we are seeing at this time have a complete exclusion for communicable disease,” said Warren Harper, Sports &amp; Events Industry Practice Leader at insurance broker Marsh’s. World Athletics also said that as far as it was aware, there were no longer insurance policies available for the coronavirus. This reluctance to offer cover comes after Lloyd’s of London estimated that insurers worldwide will hand over $100bn in pay-outs this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, including for cancelled sports, music and industry events. And insurers say they will need government help if they are to provide pandemic cover as sports groups try to plan future tournaments after much of the 2020 fixture list was cancelled. Although only larger sporting competitions usually buy “communicable disease” cover, which comes as an add-on to a cancellation policy, they typically do so at least a year in advance, insurers and brokers said. This means some tournaments taking place this year or even in 2021 could still be able to make claims. Brazil’s government will restrict the entry of foreigners to the country for 30 days due to the coronavirus pandemic, it said in a decree late on Tuesday. Foreigners with permanent residence in Brazil or working authorisation will be exempted from the decree, along with foreigners with Brazilian spouses or children. Passengers in transit to other countries are also exempted, as long as they do not leave the airports. The decree also exempts Venezuelan citizens arriving at the land border and allows foreigners involved in cargo transport. Brazil has the second-highest number of cases and deaths due to Covid-19, second only to the US. According to the health ministry, Brazil has 1.4 million cases and 59,594 people have died. Ryanair’s chief executive has told staff the airline can avoid many of its planned 3,500 job losses if they agree to pay cuts of up to 20%. Michael O’Leary, who announced plans to axe 3,000-3,500 jobs in May, said that across-the-board pay cuts could be an alternative to job losses. He told BBC News on Wednesday: We’ve already announced about 3,500 job losses but we’re engaged in extensive negotiations with our pilots, our cabin crew and we’re asking them to all take pay cuts as an alternative to job losses. We’re looking from 20% from the best paid captains, 5% from the lowest paid flight attendants and we think if we can negotiate those pay cuts by agreement, we can avoid most but not all job losses. Europe’s biggest budget airline previously said it had cut more than 250 staff from its office around Europe and was looking at up to 3,000 cuts among pilot and cabin crew because of the coronavirus crisis. Volkswagen has said it will not build a controversial new factory in Turkey because of the coronavirus pandemic, scrapping plans for the site previously on hold because of Ankara’s offensive in north-eastern Syria. The German group had last year postponed a decision on whether to go ahead with the factory because of Turkey’s incursion in its wartorn neighbour. But in the end it was the pandemic that killed off plans for the plant, which would have employed 4,000 people. Confirming the decision, VW spokesman Christoph Ludewig told AFP: “The background is that the coronavirus pandemic has had an impact on car markets and the situation is a different one from pre-corona.” Last November, VW boss Herbert Diess had defended the decision to put the factory on ice over Ankara’s Syrian incursion, saying that planning for a factory amid the military tensions would be “completely irresponsible”. The VW executive then said the company would not consider an alternative factory site but instead look at rearranging production within its existing network if it decided against building the plant in Turkey. No live fireworks, no star-studded concert on Parliament Hill, and no crowds of tourists: Canada’s official birthday celebrations on Wednesday for the first time ever will be completely online. Ottawa is usually home to the country’s largest Canada Day party, with tens of thousands of foreign and domestic tourists descending on the capital to celebrate with live music and family fun, capped off with a dazzling fireworks show. But in-person festivities have been cancelled amid Covid-19 restrictions, with organisers instead offering an online show featuring Canadian pop stars including Alanis Morissette and Avril Lavigne, along with other artists. The night will end with Canadians holding their mobile devices to the sky to watch a virtual fireworks show. Bike paths and beaches have opened in many regions, and Canadians are encouraged to have barbecues within their social bubbles and even a drink on a restaurant patio, while being mindful of social distancing guidelines, said Jantine Van Kregten, director of communications for Tourism Ottawa. “Everybody wants to do this in a safe way, so we can get back to a more regular way of life sooner rather than later,” she said. Cities across the country are adding their own flair to online Canada Day, from social media pancake breakfasts and live-stream magic shows to virtual dog parades and fun runs. But Canada Day is facing push back from Indigenous groups, which have organised #CancelCanadaDay marches across the country and will host an online counter-celebration on Wednesday featuring indigenous artists and activists. “We will not celebrate stolen Indigenous land and stolen Indigenous lives,” organisers wrote on the Idle No More website. Cases worldwide are nearing 10.5m. There have been 10,498,090 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide and 511,686 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The true number of infections is likely to be much higher, however, given the vast number of unrecorded and asymptomatic cases. New Covid-19 cases in California rose by 8,441 on Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally, the highest single-day increase since the start of the pandemic. The US as a whole had its biggest one-day spike in new infections on Tuesday with more than 47,000 cases. The US has bought up virtually all the stocks for the next three months of remdesivir, one of the two drugs proven to work against Covid-19, leaving none for the UK, Europe or most of the rest of the world. Experts and campaigners are alarmed both by the US unilateral action on remdesivir and the wider implications, for instance in the event of a vaccine becoming available. The governments of Australia and Germany have since said that they have secured sufficient supplies of the drug. The French education minister, Jean-Louis Blanquer, has said he expects all the country’s schools to return as normal at the start of the new academic year in September. “Today, our main outlook is quite optimistic. We think that the health conditions will allow us to have a normal return to classes,” Blanquer told French radio, RTL. The prime ministers of Spain and Portugal participated in a ceremony to officially reopen their joint border to all travellers after a three-month closure. Elsewhere, tourists were welcomed back to Greece, Malta and Croatia on Wednesday. The Greek prime minister said his country should prepare for a “very difficult” tourist season, with revenues from tourism predicted to decline from €18.1bn to €5bn this year. Turkey has urged the EU to correct the “mistake” of excluding it from the bloc’s list of safe coronavirus travel partners, which includes Australia and Morocco but excludes Russia, Turkey and the US. “The lack of Turkey’s presence on the list is disappointing,” Turkish foreign ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said in a statement. “We expect this mistake to be corrected as soon as possible.” Sinn Féin is facing accusations of imperilling Northern Ireland’s fight against Covid-19 after its leaders allegedly breached guidelines and regulations by leading hundreds of mourners at the funeral of an IRA commander. Mary Lou McDonald and Gerry Adams, Sinn Féin’s respective current and former leader, and Michelle O’Neill, a deputy leader who is also Northern Ireland’s deputy first minister, attended the send-off for Bobby Storey, a veteran republican and IRA figure. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said it will review footage of the funeral in Belfast on Tuesday that drew more than a thousand people. Burundi’s new president, Évariste Ndayishimiye, has declared the coronavirus the country’s “biggest enemy”, in a major about-turn for a nation which has largely ignored the dangers of the virus. “From tomorrow, I declare the Covid-19 pandemic the biggest enemy of Burundians, because it is clear it is becoming their biggest concern,” he said on Tuesday evening. “We firmly commit ourselves to fight this pandemic.” Deaths in Brazil, the second-worst affected country after the US, are nearing 60,000. Brazil has suffered 1,280 more deaths, bringing the country’s confirmed death toll to 59,594, according to health ministry data.The total number of confirmed cases rose by 33,846 to reach 1,402,041, the worst outbreak in the world outside the US. Australia locked down 300,000 in Victoria state suburbs. Authorities will lock down around 300,000 people in suburbs north of Melbourne for a month from late on Wednesday to contain the risk of infection after two weeks of double-digit rises in new coronavirus cases in Australia’s second most populous state. The UN warned jobs figures are worse than feared. The pandemic has taken a much heavier toll on jobs than previously feared, the UN says, warning the situation in the Americas is particularly dire. In a fresh study, the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that by the mid-year point, global working hours were down 14% compared with last December – equivalent to 400m full-time jobs. The United Nations has called on governments to provide nearly $10bn in aid for Syria, as the war-torn country’s humanitarian crisis deepens amid the coronavirus pandemic. The UN said it needed $3.8bn to help 11 million people in Syria – where food prices have soared. The Afghan health ministry has detected 319 new Covid-19 infections, taking the total number of confirmed cases to 31,836. The number of deaths has risen by 28 to 774, as the health ministry asked warring sides to not target medical centres amid intensified violence across the country. The country, which has admitted it has a lack of testing capacity, has tested 72,996 suspected patients since the outbreak began. The health ministry has said it has capacity for 2,000 tests a day, but has never reached that number. Ahmad Jawad Osmani, the country’s acting health minister, asked the warring sides on Wednesday to not target medical centres after fighting intensified in recent days. At least 27 civilians were killed in Helmand and dozens were wounded, including children, when mortars hit a cattle market on Monday, sparking nationwide condemnations as both government forces and Taliban blamed each other for the attack. “Both parties must stop fighting in civilian-populated areas. Such indirect fire incidents in ground engagements cause 1000s of civilian casualties each year,” the UN said. “Dozens were killed and injured in Monday’s incident, including children.” A UN mission also called on the Afghan government to set up an independent team to investigate the incident. The European Union in a statement has raised concerns over a dramatic surge in the civilian toll in Afghanistan. The EU has also warned that attacks by the Taliban could harm prospects for the start of intra-Afghan talks and called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. The EU said: The EU strongly condemns target killings, which have risen sharply in recent weeks, directed against clergy, journalists and media workers, human Rights defenders, healthcare personnel and others. It appears to be a deliberate attempt to stifle debate in advance of peace negotiations. These crimes need to be investigated and the responsible brought to justice. China has played down the threat of a new swine flu strain with pandemic potential that researchers discovered in pigs, saying the study is “not representative”. The new swine flu strain found in China, according to the study published on Monday in the US science journal PNAS, had “all the essential hallmarks” to infect humans and raised fears over another potential pandemic. But China’s foreign ministry moved to downplay fears on Wednesday. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said in a routine briefing: The G4 virus mentioned in the relevant report is a subtype of the H1N1 virus. Experts have concluded that the sample size of the report is small and not representative. Zhao added that “relevant departments and experts” will continue to step up monitoring of the disease, send warnings and handle it in a timely manner. The new G4 swine flu strain is genetically descended from the H1N1 strain that caused a pandemic in 2009, according to the study, which was authored by scientists at Chinese universities and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. G4 was observed to be highly infectious, they said, replicating in human cells and causing more serious symptoms in ferrets than other viruses. Researchers took 30,000 nasal swabs from slaughterhouse pigs in 10 Chinese provinces, allowing them to isolate 179 swine flu viruses. According to the study, 10.4% of pig slaughterhouse workers tested had already been infected. So far, there has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission. China did not elaborate further on how many had been infected by G4. “It is of concern that human infection of G4 virus will further human adaptation and increase the risk of a human pandemic,” the researchers wrote, calling for urgent measures to monitor people working with pigs. New Covid-19 cases in California rose by 8,441 on Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally, the highest single-day increase since the start of the pandemic. The US as a whole had its biggest one-day spike in new infections on Tuesday, with more than 47,000 cases. California, Texas and Arizona have emerged as new US centres of the pandemic. Germany has for now secured enough supplies of remdesivir, which is set to become the first Covid-19 treatment approved in Europe, and is banking on developer Gilead to meet future needs, the country’s health ministry said. “The federal government has early on secured remdesivir for the treatment of coronavirus patients. Currently, there are still sufficient reserves,” the ministry told Reuters. With a conditional market approval, which is expected to be issued by the EU commission this week, comes an obligation to deliver sufficient quantities in the future, it added. “We trust Gilead will meet this obligation,” the ministry said. North Korea has reopened schools, but has kept a ban on public gatherings and made it mandatory for people to wear masks in public places as part of its response to the coronavirus, a World Health Organization official has said. While North Korea has not confirmed any infections, its Ministry of Public Health has been sharing weekly updates with the WHO on steps it is taking to ward off the pandemic, said Edwin Salvador, the agency’s representative to the reclusive country. In the latest update provided on 19 June, the ministry said all educational institutions are now open, with children required to wear masks and washing stations installed. The ministry also reported that all of 922 people checked so far have tested negative, while hundreds of others, mostly cargo handlers at seaports and land borders, are regularly quarantined for monitoring, Salvador said. Temperature checks using infra-red thermometers, hand washing facilities and sanitisers continue to be in place in all public places including shopping malls, restaurants and hotels. It is mandatory for all people to wear masks in public places and no public gatherings are allowed. Pyongyang devised a “national preparedness and response plan” in February based on the WHO’s recommendations, under which it appointed community doctors, each of whom is responsible for 130 households, Salvador said. It also set up 235 ‘Rapid Response Teams’ consisting of an epidemiologist, doctor, nurse, paramedical and a livestock official, tasked with investigating any suspected cases. Hello everyone, this is Jessica Murray taking over the global coronavirus blog for the next few hours. As always, please do send over any story tips and suggestions. Email: jessica.murray@theguardian.com Twitter: @journojess_ The French education minister, Jean-Louis Blanquer, has said he expects all the country’s schools to return to normal at the start of the new academic year in September. Blanquer said the situation with Covid-19 in France, where the virus has been deemed under control, meant the return to classes after two-month summer holidays, known in France as “la rentrée”, would be “a normal return”. “Today, our main outlook is quite optimistic. We think that the health conditions will allow us to have a normal return to classes,” the minister told French radio, RTL. “Everyone should be there … except if there is a worsening of the situation. Of course, we will prepare for any further crisis.” Blanquer said schools reopening and operating as before the pandemic was “fundamental … for educational and also psychological reasons”. He reported that since president Emmanuel Macron ordered everyone back to school from 22 June, only about 20% of pupils had stayed away. “It’s still a lot, but even in normal times there are not 100% of pupils at school because at the end of June many of them leave on holidays,” Blanquer said. The number of patients in French hospital and intensive care with Covid-19 has been declining since reaching a peak in April. The number of hospital deaths over the previous 24 hours dropped to 21 on Tuesday with nine reported in French care homes over the past week. Dr Iván Cruz wanted to shock people out of pandemic scepticism with X-rays of his coronavirus-scarred lungs Before he died in hospital, the young Mexican doctor had intended to publish them online to convince the unbelievers: coronavirus exists, and this is what it does to you. “It makes you feel impotent and angry not to be able to grab people and tell them: ‘Don’t you get it?’” said Agileo Cruz, the father of the 28-year-old Mexican doctor, who died from Covid-19-related complications last month. In late April, with only 1,351 fatalities, the president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, claimed the pandemic had been “tamed”. But on Saturday Mexico recorded 602 deaths, the highest number anywhere in the world that day. Despite the growing tragedy, some in Mexico continue to doubt the virus’s very existence, taking no precautions and insisting that the epidemic is little but a government invention. More here: Earlier today the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, and his Portuguese counterpart, Antonio Costa, officially reopened their joint border to all travellers after a three-month closure to prevent the spread of coronavirus, in a ceremony also attended by Spain’s King Felipe and Portugal’s President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. “Our shared prosperity and common destiny within the European project depend on this border being open,” Costa tweeted earlier on Wednesday. “The pandemic offered us a new vision of the past we do not want to come back to: a continent with closed borders.” Here are a few pictures from last night’s “farewell party” for Covid-19 in Prague, where more than 1,000 people ate together at a giant table that stretched across the Charles Bridge. “The bridge is a good metaphor, different people can gather,” said Ondrej Kobza, who organised the event. The event “is a kind of celebration, to show that we are not afraid, that we go out and we won’t be stuck at home,” he said, noting that the dinner was only possible because there were hardly any tourists now. The guests were invited to share among themselves the meals and drinks they brought. The Czech Republic was among the first to implement tough restrictions designed to curb the coronavirus in mid-March. As of 30 June, the country of 10.7 million reported 11,895 cases and 349 deaths connected to the illness. Turkey on Wednesday urged the EU to correct the “mistake” of excluding it from the bloc’s list of safe coronavirus travel partners, saying it was disappointed by the move. On Tuesday, Brussels produced a list of 15 countries including Australia and Morocco whose health situation was deemed safe enough to allow their citizens to travel to the EU from 1 July. But the UUS was notably excluded along with Russia and Turkey. “The lack of Turkey’s presence on the list is disappointing,” Turkish foreign ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said in a statement. “We expect this mistake to be corrected as soon as possible.” Aksoy added that the decision should have been made on the basis of “objective criteria”. He insisted Turkey had handled the coronavirus pandemic well, pointing to the “precautions, work undertaken and success” of the Turkish authorities. Turkey has recorded 5,131 deaths since the first reported case of Covid-19, while nearly 200,000 people have been infected, according to health ministry figures on Tuesday. Doctors, however, have raised concerns that Turkey is not following all the World Health Organization’s reporting standards. Workers at a chicken processing facility in western North Carolina reportedly underwent widespread testing for Covid-19 in early June. Workers at the plant were scared. Several employees had already tested positive and the company, Case Farms – which has been repeatedly condemned for animal treatment and workers’ rights violations – was not providing proper protective equipment. “We don’t have a lot of space at work. We are shoulder to shoulder,” said one worker, who declined to be identified, during a recent union call. “I’m afraid to go to work, but I have to go.” The testing turned up 150 positive cases at the facility, the worker said. On 8 June, the health department for Burke county, where the Case Farms facility is located, reported 136 new Covid cases, a 25% increase in its total caseload. Yet neither the company, county officials nor the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services would confirm whether those cases were connected to Case Farms. It is just one example of the currently taut relationship between public health and the economy in North Carolina, as the number of Covid-19 cases and hospitalisations rises.

A charter plane carrying 172 passengers from Hamburg landed at Heraklion airport on Crete at 8am, minutes after another aircraft had arrived from the Czech Republic, reopening the island’s air links with the outside world. The visitors received an enthusiastic welcome with airport ground staff spraying the planes with water jets as they taxied to their gates and local musicians greeting tourists as they emerged from the arrivals hall. “Tourism has got off to a dynamic start on Crete,” the airport’s manager, Giorgos Pliakas, told local TV, saying 40 international flights were expected on Wednesday. “It’s encouraging that all the flights are full.” Until late last night 150 flights had been scheduled to land at regional airports around Greece including the popular destinations of Mykonos, Rhodes, Corfu and Kos. By this morning that figure had dropped to 104, an abrupt change highlighting the last-minute flight cancellations that are likely to become the new normal in the age of coronavirus. With the exception of the UK and Sweden, from where flights continue to be suspended until 15 July – illuminating the lack of headway made by both countries in containing the virus - there are no restrictions on arrivals from other European countries. Athens, following EU guidelines, has also permitted air traffic to resume with 15 other nations including Australia, Canada and New Zealand. But in a country that has managed to keep infection and casualty rates low, tourism’s resumption also resembles a military operation. In Crete, as in other airports, public health officials have created special screening areas with mask-wearing travellers being subject to Covid-19 tests upon arrival – depending on the findings of an electronic form all are obliged to complete 48 hours before entering Greece. Sinn Féin is facing accusations of imperilling Northern Ireland’s fight against Covid-19 after its leaders allegedly breached guidelines and regulations by leading hundreds of mourners at the funeral of an IRA commander. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said it will review footage of the funeral in Belfast on Tuesday that drew more than a thousand people in apparent violation of rules limiting outdoor gatherings to 30 people. Mary Lou McDonald and Gerry Adams, Sinn Féin’s respective current and former leader, and Michelle O’Neill, a deputy leader who is also Northern Ireland’s deputy first minister, attended the send-off for Bobby Storey, a veteran republican and IRA figure. Politicians from other parties who share executive power with Sinn Féin at Stormont accused it of undermining efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic. “What we are seeing … was a breach of the guidance that has been issued and has been worked on by the executive and has been supported by the executive,” said the health minister, Robin Swann. “I sincerely hope that this isn’t the Dominic Cummings effect in Northern Ireland because in our health service we can’t afford it to be.” It was a reference to the Downing Street adviser taking long drives during England’s lockdown. Naomi Long, the justice minister and Alliance party leader, said in a tweet that when the rule-makers break the rules it was more hurtful “for all who made huge sacrifices to obey the regulations”. O’Neill, who is expected to face tough questions at Stormont on Wednesday, defended her attendance at the funeral and said it respected regulations and guidelines. The cortège had a “maximum of 30 people” and the service inside St Agnes’ Church was “exemplary” in terms of social distancing and hygiene, with only three people per pew, she told the Irish News. “It was all done in accordance with the guidelines.” The loosening of lockdown restrictions has prompted loyalist Orange Order marching bands to ask permission to hold traditional parades this month. An update to earlier news that the US has bought up virtually all the stocks for the next three months of remdesivir, one of the two drugs proven to work against Covid-19, leaving none for the UK, Europe or most of the rest of the world: Australia has also got plenty. Burundi’s new president, Evariste Ndayishimiye, has declared the coronavirus the country’s “biggest enemy”, in a major about-turn for a nation which has largely ignored the dangers of the virus. Former president Pierre Nkurunziza, who died suddenly last month, and even Ndayishimiye himself, had previously downplayed the gravity of the pandemic, saying God had spared Burundi from its ravages. Burundi held a full campaign ahead of May’s election, and unlike its neighbours which have imposed lockdowns and curfews, has taken few measures to combat the spread of the virus. Officially the country has reported only 170 cases and one death in two months. Ndayishimiye was speaking late Tuesday after the swearing in of his new government in parliament. “From tomorrow, I declare the Covid-19 pandemic the biggest enemy of Burundians, because it is clear it is becoming their biggest concern,” he said. “We firmly commit ourselves to fight this pandemic.” When coronavirus claimed its first victim in India’s largest slum in April, many feared the disease would turn its narrow, congested streets into a graveyard, with social distancing or contact tracing all but impossible. But three months on, Mumbai’s Dharavi offers a rare glimmer of hope with new infections shrinking, thanks to an aggressive strategy that focused on “chasing the virus, instead of waiting for disaster”, according to city official Kiran Dighavkar, AFP reports. The sprawling slum has long been a byword for the financial capital’s bitter income disparities - with Dharavi’s estimated one million people scraping a living as factory workers or maids and chauffeurs to Mumbai’s well-heeled residents. With a dozen people typically sleeping in a single room, and hundreds using the same public toilet, authorities realised early that standard practices would be of little use. “Social distancing was never a possibility, home isolation was never an option, and contact tracing was a huge problem with so many people using the same toilet,” Dighavkar told AFP. An initial plan to conduct door-to-door screenings was abandoned after Mumbai’s searing heat and humidity left medical workers feeling suffocated under layers of protective equipment as they combed the area’s cramped alleys for cases. But, with infections rising fast and fewer than 50,000 people checked for symptoms, officials needed to move quickly and get creative. What they came up with was coined “Mission Dharavi”. Each day, medical workers set up a “fever camp” in a different part of the slum, so residents could be screened for symptoms and tested for coronavirus if needed. Schools, wedding halls and sports complexes were repurposed as quarantine facilities that offered free meals, vitamins and “laughter yoga” sessions. Strict containment measures were deployed in virus hotspots that were home to 125,000 people, including the use of drones to monitor their movements and alert police, while a huge army of volunteers swung into action, distributing rations so they didn’t go hungry. Bollywood stars and business tycoons paid for medical equipment as construction workers built a 200-bed field hospital at breakneck speed in a park inside Dharavi. By late June, more than half the slum’s population had been screened for symptoms and around 12,000 tested for coronavirus. So far Dharavi has reported just 82 deaths - a fraction of Mumbai’s more than 4,500 fatalities. “We are on the brink of victory, I feel very proud,” said Abhay Taware, a doctor who saw around 100 patients daily in his tiny clinic at the height of the crisis. The 44-year-old father-of-two also had to fight his own battle against coronavirus when he contracted the disease in April, but told AFP he had “no doubts” about returning to work. “I thought I could show my patients that a positive diagnosis does not mean the end,” he said. With Mumbai and Delhi struggling to accommodate coronavirus patients as India’s cases surge past half a million officials are also wary of celebrating too soon. “It’s a war. Everything is dynamic. Right now, we feel like we are on top of the situation. The challenge will be when factories reopen,” said Dighavkar, referring to the billion-dollar leather and recycling industries run out of Dharavi’s cramped tenements. And some in the slum fear their community might not be as lucky next time. On a blazing morning, as car salesman Vinod Kamble lined up to have his temperature taken, he recalled his terror when the virus landed in Mumbai. “I felt like Dharavi would be destroyed, and nothing would be left,” he told AFP, describing the near impossibility of avoiding infection in the slum. “We need better infrastructure,” the 32-year-old said. Otherwise the next time a disease like this emerges, I don’t think Dharavi will be able to escape.” When Jacinda Ardern urged New Zealanders to stand firm behind her government’s decision to keep the country’s borders tightly closed against Covid-19, the prime minister described a reality that many around the world could only imagine with envy. “We get to enjoy weekend sport, go to restaurants and bars, our workplaces are open, and we can gather in whatever numbers we like,” she said. New Zealanders returned in June to normal life with strict border controls the only remnant of a pandemic that months ago had threatened to sweep the country as it had in most others before a strict lockdown quashed its spread. But now its inhabitants now face a burgeoning anxiety that some find more difficult to cope with than the fear of the pandemic, analysts say: an open-ended uncertainty about their own futures and New Zealand’s place in the world if the virus continues to rage elsewhere. Keep reading here: Here’s an AFP report on an anticipated baby boom in Indonesia: With her husband left jobless by the pandemic, the last thing Indonesian mother Juarsih needed was to get pregnant, but now she’s expecting a third child – one of many in the country anxiously preparing for a Covid-fuelled baby boom. Indonesian authorities believe there could be 400,000 more births than usual next year as lockdowns keep couples at home and cut access to contraception, prompting fears of an increase in abortions and stunting of children in poorer families. Juarsih, 41, says her birth control ran out as clinics closed or slashed hours and overwhelmed hospitals struggled to keep up with mounting coronavirus infections in the world’s fourth most populous country. The mother of two teenagers is now too scared of the deadly respiratory disease to risk going out for a pregnancy checkup in her hometown Bandung, on Java island. “At first I was shocked when I found out that I was pregnant,” she said. “I started feeling happy later although there’s still some sadness … I should be grateful but this is happening at a difficult time.” Contraception use has “dropped drastically” since the pandemic took hold across the sprawling archipelago in early March, Hasto Wardoyo, the head of Indonesia’s national population and family planning board, told AFP. Health authorities are worried increasing numbers of expectant parents will turn to abortions and push up maternal mortality rates. “We’re also worried about stunting – not all families can afford proper nutrition,” he said. This week. authorities launched a one-day blitz that aimed to give away contraceptives to one million citizens. Condoms are not popular in Indonesia, where 98% of contraceptive users are women, mainly of hormone injections and birth-control pills. The family planning agency also enlisted the help of celebrities with huge social media followings to get the word out to the country’s nearly 270 million people. Nearly 3,000 people have died of Covid-19 in Indonesia, according to an official tally, but independent researchers say the real toll could be several times higher. Michael Veale, a lecturer in digital rights and regulation in the faculty of laws at University College London, on the Apple-Google contact-tracing app: In April, Apple and Google announced a partnership. They would take research into how to undertake Bluetooth-powered Covid-19 contact tracing in a privacy-preserving manner, with no central database, and make it available as a toolkit inside their operating systems for public health authority–sanctioned apps. Before they did this, all such apps had effectively been doomed to fail. At least on iPhones, they were crippled by the same baked-in Bluetooth restrictions that stop normal apps secretly tracking you. The firms’ contact-tracing toolkit has been both praised and condemned. Its “decentralised” approach, with no sensitive central database of who-saw-who, has been supported by hundreds of privacy, security and human rights scholars. The concerns are understandable. The history of passports – which were introduced as a seemingly temporary measure during the first world war, but were retained in response to fears about spreading the Spanish flu – shows that pandemics can significantly influence our social infrastructure. And so they should be designed to minimise future misuse.

Thanks! That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. Thanks for following along – and stay tuned for the latest global updates with my colleague Simon Burnton. The US again reported a record one-day increase in coronavirus cases on Tuesday, with 44,358 new coronavirus cases confirmed in the country, according to coronavirus database the Covid Tracking Project, as infections surge across the country, which is the worst-affected worldwide in terms of cases and deaths. The US has more than 2.6m cases and accounts for approximately one in four known deaths worldwide, with the country’s toll at 127,410. There are close to 10.5m cases globally, with infections rising by around 150,000 in the last 24 hours alone to 10,450,628. The global death toll stand at 510,632. Brazil, with the highest cases and deaths outside of the US, recorded 1,280 more fatalities on Tuesday, bringing the country’s confirmed death toll to nearly 60,000, with the total at 59,594, according to health ministry data. The total number of confirmed cases stands at 1,402,041. On Twitter, the Covid Tracking Project said the US’s seven-day average for new daily cases has doubled since 13 June and that hospitalisations in the country jumped by the highest number since 21 April. It marks the fourth time in a week that the country posted a one-day case record, according to the New York Times, which said new cases in the US had increased by 80% in two weeks. On Sunday, CNN reported that cases were rising in 36 US states, with just two – Connecticut and Rhode Island – reporting declines in their daily infections. Here is a look at coronavirus-related front pages from around the UK this morning: Wednesday briefing: Experts ‘expect more Leicesters’ A rise in coronavirus infections has been detected in areas of England, Scotland and Wales, raising fears of renewed Leicester-style lockdowns as the countries prepare to ease restrictions. The Medway in Kent, the boroughs of Hammersmith and Fulham and Ealing in London, and Lanarkshire and Dumfries and Galloway in Scotland saw a rise in infections in the week to 25 June, according to official data. Other areas seeing higher rates included Bedford, Barnsley and Flintshire. The much-awaited reopening of pubs is set for Saturday throughout England, and from 15 July in Scotland. “I am expecting there to be a number of Leicesters,” said Prof Deenan Pillay, a virologist at UCL. Some clothing factories in Leicester remained open during the national lockdown and ordered workers to work even when they were sick, labour campaigners have claimed, amid concerns that the city’s garment industry has played a key role in the resurgence of cases. The government has been criticised for “sowing confusion” about the city’s new lockdown, while residents and businesses said they were baffled by the messaging. Cases worldwide are nearing 10.5m. There are 10,450,628 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, and 510,632 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The US saw a record one-day case increase. Tuesday saw 44,358 new coronavirus cases confirmed in the US, according to The Covid Tracking Project, which said on Twitter that the 7-day average for new daily cases as doubled since 13 June and that hospitalisations in the country jumped by the highest number since 21 April. Tuesday saw 44,358 new coronavirus cases confirmed in the US, according to The Covid Tracking Project, which said on Twitter that the 7-day average for new daily cases as doubled since 13 June and that hospitalisations in the country jumped by the highest number since 21 April. Deaths in Brazil, the second-worst affected country after the US, are nearing 60,000. Brazil has suffered 1,280 more deaths, bringing the country’s confirmed death toll to 59,594, according to Health Ministry data.The total number of confirmed cases rose by 33,846 to reach 1,402,041, the worst outbreak in the world outside the United States. Australia locked down 300,000 in Victoria state suburbs. Authorities will lock down around 300,000 people in suburbs north of Melbourne for a month from late on Wednesday to contain the risk of infection after two weeks of double-digit rises in new coronavirus cases in Australia’s second most populous state. The UN warned jobs figures are worse than feared. The pandemic has taken a much heavier toll on jobs than previously feared, the UN says, warning the situation in the Americas is particularly dire.In a fresh study, the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that by the mid-year point, global working hours were down 14 percent compared to last December - equivalent to some 400 million full-time jobs. Three asylum seekers at camp near US border tested positive for coronavirus. Three asylum seekers have tested positive for coronavirus in a sprawling border encampment, marking the first cases in a settlement that advocates have long viewed as vulnerable amid the pandemic, Reuters reports. The US has bought up virtually all the stocks for the next three months of remdesivir, one of the two drugs proven to work against Covid-19, leaving none for the UK, Europe or most of the rest of the world, my colleague Sarah Boseley reports. Experts and campaigners are alarmed both by the US unilateral action on remdesivir and the wider implications, for instance in the event of a vaccine becoming available. The Trump administration has already shown that it is prepared to outbid and outmanoeuvre all other countries to secure the medical supplies it needs for the US. South Korea is treating severe coronavirus cases with remdesivir. South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency reports that South Korea has started providing remdesivir to patients for coronavirus treatment. Dr Anthony Fauci told US senators he “would not be surprised” if cases go up to 100,000 a day. He said the US is “going in the wrong direction” in its handling of the coronavirus pandemic and warned that the death toll “is going to be very disturbing” unless officials intervene, and urged Americans to wear masks and practice social distancing in public spaces. Speaking in Delaware, Joe Biden said the pandemic is unlikely to have subsided by January 2021, and if he’s elected. “On the day I’m sworn in, I’ll get right to work implementing all aspects of the response that remain undone,” he said. The United Nations has called on governments to provide nearly $10bn in aid for Syria, as the war-torn country’s humanitarian crisis deepens amid the coronavirus pandemic. The UN said it needed $3.8bn to help 11 million people in Syria – where food prices have soared – and a further $6.04bn to help the 6.6 million Syrians who have fled the country. Greece should prepare for a “very difficult” tourist season, the country’s prime minister has said. Tourism officials say the country – which usually makes around 18.1 billion a year from tourism – would be lucky if revenues hit the 4-5 billion euro mark this year. Authorities will lock down around 300,000 people in suburbs north of Melbourne for a month from late on Wednesday to contain the risk of infection after two weeks of double-digit rises in new coronavirus cases in Australia’s second most populous state. Australia has fared better than many countries in the pandemic, with around 7,830 cases and 104 deaths, but the recent surge has stoked fears of a second wave of Covid-19. From midnight tonight, more than 30 suburbs in Australia’s second-biggest city will return to stage three restrictions, the third-strictest level in curbs to control the pandemic. That means residents will be confined to home except for grocery shopping, health appointments, work or caregiving, and exercise. The restrictions will be accompanied by a testing blitz that authorities hope will extend to half the population of the area affected, and for which borders will be patrolled, authorities said. The measures come as curbs ease across the rest of the state of Victoria, with restaurants, gyms and cinemas reopening in recent weeks. Victoria recorded 73 fresh cases on Tuesday from 20,682 tests, following an increase of 75 cases on Monday. State premier Daniel Andrews warned on Wednesday that the return of broader restrictions across city remained a possibility. Spain’s Teatro Real will reopen its doors to the public on Wednesday, becoming one of the world’s first opera houses to return to the stage with a production that includes a chorus, orchestra and soloists after months of lockdown. On offer is Verdi’s La Traviata, tweaked to reflect life in the time of Covid-19. “There are people who prefer to sit with their arms crossed and wait until we return to normal,” said Joan Matabosch, the artistic director of the Teatro Real. “And then there are theatres that prefer to try and conquer the normality that we find ourselves in.” South Korea: incidents of Covid-19 ‘mask rage’ flare as summer heats up The onset of summer has sparked a rise in incidents of “mask rage” in South Korea, as more hot and bothered commuters either refuse to wear face coverings or leave parts of their faces exposed. In South Korea, Japan and other countries in east Asia, widespread mask wearing has been cited as one possible explanation for the region’s relative success in bringing the Covid-19 pandemic under control. South Korea, one of the first countries outside China to be affected by the virus, flattened the coronavirus curve in April, although it is now struggling with dozens of daily cases, mainly in and around the capital Seoul. To avoid a second major outbreak, the government in June required masks to be worn on all buses and subways, and inside taxis, with drivers permitted to refuse passengers without face coverings. But the country’s typically hot summer is making mask wearing increasingly uncomfortable, with temperatures regularly exceeding 30C last month. As a result, more people are refusing to wear them, or are positioning them across their chins so they leave their mouth and nose exposed. Hi, Helen Sullivan here. A reminder that you can send comments, questions, news, tips from your part of the world, and other people’s good tweets, to me directly at the places below: Twitter: @helenrsullivan Email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com The full story on the case increases in Victoria, Australia now: The state reported 73 new Covid-19 cases overnight, with 10 hotspot postcodes to enter lockdown from midnight as the state tries to bring the cases under control. While there were 14 new cases announced in New South Wales overnight, all of those were in returned international travellers now in quarantine hotels. Of Victoria’s cases, only three were from hotel quarantine, with community transmission becoming a growing concern in the state over the past fortnight. The source of 42 of Victoria’s newest cases remains under investigation. The Victorian premier Daniel Andrews told reporters on Wednesday that the work of public health officials door-knocking the most affected suburbs and offering people free testing was now a key part of the state’s strategy to bring the spread under control. Now, the answers you’ve all been waiting for. The questions: Why are Nick Kyrgios and Boris Becker fighting? Who is the rat and who is the doughnut? The Guardian’s Mike Hytner explains what is going on with tennis Twitter to Gabrielle Jackson: Mike, I’m hearing some vague murmurings about Nick Kyrgios and Boris Becker, rats and doughnuts. Sounds intriguing. What’s going on? It’s just another day in the bizarre world that is post-Covid tennis Twitter. Australia’s most outspoken and entertaining tennis star has attracted a strong rebuke on the socials from the German six-time grand slam champion after Kyrgios aired his views about how some in tennis have responded to the coronavirus crisis – recklessly and selfishly, in Nick’s view. Reckless and selfish? Sounds like some world leaders I know. Tell me more. Alex Zverev, the Russian world No 7, was filmed partying at a crowded bar on the Côte d’Azur, apparently just six days after he vowed to be a good boy and self-isolate following the debacle of Novak Djokovic’s Adria Tour event. Disneyland Tokyo reopened today, after four months of being closed due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Mainichi reports: In order to keep the number of visitors to less than half pre-pandemic levels, the parks’ operator Oriental Land Co. will limit entry to fixed-date tickets purchased online in advance. Operating hours at the parks, which had been closed since 29 February have been shortened from 8am to 8pm. Attractions and restaurants will cater to a smaller number of visitors while most entertainment shows and parades, including the nighttime Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade Dreamlights, will remain canceled. Visitors are required to undergo body temperature checks and wear a face mask to enter the park, and will be asked to keep a certain distance from Disney characters during meets. Here are some more photos: Panama registered 765 new cases of coronavirus infection on Tuesday, taking the total number in the country to 33,550, while deaths climbed by 11 to 631 overall, the health ministry said in a statement. More on remdesivir now from Australia: Associate Professor Barbara Mintzes from The University of Sydney Charles Perkins Centre and School of Pharmacy said if remdesivir does prove effective in treating Covid-19, the drug would be needed not only in the US but globally, including in Australia. “The US arrangement to buy 500,000 doses of remdesivir from Gilead raises concerns not only about access in other countries but also how to prevent profiteering from the Covid-19 pandemic and ensuring that patients who need treatment are able to access it,” she said. Gilead announced its global price for remdesivir on 29 June as US $390 per vial. The Guardian reports that the cost will be US$3200 for a 6-day treatment, or AUD$4607. The cost of production of remdesivir has been estimated to be less than US$1 per day or US $6 (AUD$ 8.64) for a 6-day course of treatment. “Gilead has licensing agreements with manufacturers in Egypt, India and Pakistan to supply remdesivir to 127 low to middle-income countries. The US deal with Gilead and limits on which countries can be supplied under this licensing agreement leave countries like Australia in the lurch: unable to access remdesivir from Gilead at a high price - as the US is doing - and unable to access it at a low price from generic manufacturers, as lower income countries can.” As for a solution, Mintzes said international trade agreements in a public health emergency, governments can issue compulsory licenses to bypass patent protection and either produce a drug themselves or buy the drug from generic manufacturers. The Netherlands is currently considering an amendment to its patent law to allow compulsory licensing of remdesivir. “Currently we don’t know for sure whether remdesivir will prove to be an important treatment for Covid-19,” she said. “If it does, given that the US is buying out Gilead’s supply, and also given the extremely high price as compared with costs of production, the obvious solution for Australia would be to also consider compulsory licensing.” Tuesday saw 44,358 new coronavirus cases confirmed in the US, according to The Covid Tracking Project, which said on Twitter that the 7-day average for new daily cases as doubled since 13 June and that hospitalisations in the country jumped by the highest number since 21 April. The high marks the fourth time in a week that the country, the worst-affected worldwide in terms of number of cases and deaths, posted a one-day case record, the New York Times reports. According to the Times’ own analysis, new cases in the US have increased by 80% in two weeks. On Sunday CNN reported that cases were rising in 36 US states, with just two – Connecticut and Rhode Island – reporting declines in their daily infections. The state of Victoria, Australia, which has been struggling to control a recent coronavirus outbreak, has recorded another 73 Covid-19 cases overnight, according to Premier Daniel Andrews. It’s the fifth-highest day for Covid cases recorded in one day since the pandemic began. Andrews told reporters at a press conference: Three from hotel quarantine, nine that are associated with known and contained outbreaks, 19 as a result of routine testing and 42 that remain under investigation by our public health team. We did 20,682 tests yesterday so I’ll take this opportunity to thank every single one of those going on for 21,000 people who presented for a test. As we reported earlier, news emerged overnight that the US has bought up all supply of the drug remdesivir for the next three months. The drug has shown some promise in helping Covid-19 patients recover faster from Covid-19, and is manufactured by US pharmaceutical giant Gilead. The Guardian’s UK health reporter Sarah Boseley wrote that “Experts and campaigners are alarmed both by the US unilateral action on remdesivir and the wider implications, for instance in the event of a vaccine becoming available. The Trump administration has already shown that it is prepared to outbid and outmanoeuvre all other countries to secure the medical supplies it needs for the US”. Guardian Australia has asked the federal health minister Greg Hunt about whether he is concerned about the US buying up supply, and whether Australia has enough of the drug in its national medical stockpile to manage in the meantime. A spokesman said he will provide a response this afternoon. Associate Professor Alice Motion from the school of chemistry the University of Sydney, who works as part of open source drug discovery projects including the Breaking Goodcitizen science project. She said the actions of the US are a “real concern”. “We would want to make sure something like this isn’t possible for a vaccine,” Associate Professor Motion said. “A vaccine should be available to people all over the world rather than one country, or a group of countries having preferred access to a medicine. Remdesivir is a medicine that helps people to recover faster, but imagine if the same thing happened with a vaccine that emerges. That would be terrible. It’s also a bit of a risk too because lots of different medicines that we all need across the world are not made in the countries where the patients live. If you start to buy up all the supply of one medicine you could see other countries that then might not be as willing to distribute or to share medicines with the US.” She said the actions of the US raised fundamental issues about fair and equitable access to medicine. “The other issue is whether everyone in the US will now have equal access to remdesivir too,” she said. “Equal access is not just an issue on a global level, but within countries.” Professor Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician with the Australian National University, said similar issues were seen early on in the pandemic with access to personal protective equipment, with countries holding on to their supply while other countries struggled to get protective gear. “Many countries prioritise their own,” he said. “Of course, I don’t agree with it. It’s not good practice and we need the arts and behavioural experts to look into this and this attitude.” Charlotte Graham-McLay reports for the Guardian: New Zealand has reported a second consecutive day of no new cases of Covid-19, according to health officials. There are 22 active cases of the coronavirus in New Zealand, all of them travelers returning to the country. There is no known community transmission of the virus in New Zealand. Of those sufferers, 21 remain in government-run quarantine, which is a compulsory for all travelers entering the country. One is in a stable condition in Auckland City Hospital. Only New Zealanders and their families, along with certain essential workers, are permitted to enter the country. They must spend two weeks in quarantine, where they are tested twice for the coronavirus. New Zealand has recorded 1,178 cases of Covid-19, and 22 deaths. Last month the country reported a streak of 24 straight days without a fresh diagnosed instance of the virus before the number of New Zealanders returning from abroad began to grow. The state of New South Wales in Australia on Wednesday announced 14 new coronavirus cases, but all are travellers currently in hotel quarantine, state health minister Brad Hazzard announced. The day before, 5 cases were reported among travellers. The state also eased its restrictions as follows, AAP reports: Funerals, weddings, and church services now allow for the maximum number of people permitted on the premises, with one person per four square metres Up to 20 people can visit another household in NSW at one time and guests can stay overnight, with no daily limit on visitors No restrictions on travelling within NSW and up to 20 people can stay at a holiday home Up to 20 people can gather outside in a public place Community sport can have up to 500 participants - including players, trainers, officials and spectators - with a Covid-19 safety plan All businesses can now open and operate in NSW, with some required to implement a Covid-19 safety plan Music festivals remain banned and nightclubs remain shut. The pandemic has taken a much heavier toll on jobs than previously feared, the UN says, warning the situation in the Americas is particularly dire. In a fresh study, the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that by the mid-year point, global working hours were down 14 percent compared to last December - equivalent to some 400 million full-time jobs. Yonhap also reports that fights are starting in South Korea over the wearing of masks on public transport. The government has made wearing face masks mandatory on public transport and taxis, but the summer heat is discouraging some from obeying the rules: This has even coined the term “tuk-sk,” referring to wearing masks lower to only cover the wearer’s chin, with “tuk” meaning chin in Korean. ... Last week, police asked the Seoul Southern District Court to detain a woman in her forties who had got into a bickering match with other passengers after they asked her to wear a mask. The woman, who was apprehended at a subway No. 1 station, allegedly cursed at passengers asking her to wear a mask and delayed the train schedule for around seven minutes. Police said the issue should not be taken lightly considering that “mandatorily wearing a mask on public transportation is an issue that is directly related to public health.” The court, however, denied the request, citing that the woman said she didn’t wear the face mask due to health-related reasons and promised to wear it going forward. Earlier this month, a man in his fifties was formally detained by the Seoul Eastern District Court after assaulting a bus driver and another passenger who asked him to wear a face mask. South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency reports that South Korea has started providing remdesivir to patients for coronavirus treatment. The drug has been used to treat Ebola. It is the same drug that the US has bought almost all global stocks of. Yonhap reports: The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said the medication developed by US pharmaceutical giant Gilead Sciences Inc. will be used for Covid-19 patients with severe symptoms. The KCDC said it signed an agreement with Gilead Sciences, with details of the imported amount and price not to be disclosed. Last month, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, South Korea’s drug safety watchdog, approved the use of remdesivir as a treatment drug for Covid-19, allowing special imports by using its special measures procedure. Three asylum seekers have tested positive for coronavirus in a sprawling border encampment, marking the first cases in a settlement that advocates have long viewed as vulnerable amid the pandemic, Reuters reports. Since confirmed cases of coronavirus in Mexico began rising in March, advocates and government officials have worried about the potential for an outbreak in the Matamoros camp, where an estimated 2,000 migrants live in tents on the banks of the Rio Grande river. Here’s your weekly roundup of coronavirus news from the Pacific, with Dan McGarry in Port Vila and Tess Newton Cain: The total number of cases of Covid-19 infection listed by the World Health Organization for the region stands at 382, an increase of 22 since last week. With increasing evidence that many of the world’s worst-affected nations are either unprepared or unwilling to fight the virus, it’s clear that Pacific islanders will be living with Covid-19 on their borders for years to come. Despite this, countries have been slow to adapt. Tourism-reliant nations are instead focusing on finding ways to restart the industry as it was before the pandemic. Others simply languish. Despite imminent labour shortages in the agricultural sector in New Zealand and Australia, little progress has been made to safely replace thousands of repatriated workers. Pacific islanders working in the US appear to be more exposed to Covid-19 than most other ethnicities. A large number of them report at least one family member who is an essential worker, and many of them live and/or work in crowded conditions. In less serious news from Brazil, municipal authorities in the city of Petropolis said they discovered a speakeasy masquerading as a pet shop. Reuters reports: The shutters were down, but the pub chatter in the midst of a coronavirus quarantine gave the game away: a crowded Brazilian bar under the cover of a pet shop with no pets. Inspectors found 16 patrons drinking beer, none of them wearing a mandatory mask or keeping to social distancing rules. “The owner served customers behind a closed door. They came in through the adjacent pet shop,” a city spokesman said. The mayor’s office said the shop, which had pet food but no animals, lacked proper registration papers. Under the lockdown in the mountain city above Rio de Janeiro, bars are not allowed to open while pet shops are viewed as an essential service that can. The shop was closed after the raid and the bar owner fined. Brazil has suffered 1,280 more deaths, bringing the country’s confirmed death toll to 59,594, according to Health Ministry data. The total number of confirmed cases rose by 33,846 to reach 1,402,041, the worst outbreak in the world outside the United States. Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, as the seventh month of the coronavirus crisis begins. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be with you for the next few hours. I welcome your comments, questions, news, tips and flattery. Here’s where to send them: Twitter: @helenrsullivan Email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com The US has bought up virtually all the stocks for the next three months of one of the two drugs proven to work against Covid-19, leaving none for the UK, Europe or most of the rest of the world, my colleague Sarah Boseley reports. Experts and campaigners are alarmed both by the US unilateral action on remdesivir and the wider implications, for instance in the event of a vaccine becoming available. The Trump administration has already shown that it is prepared to outbid and outmanoeuvre all other countries to secure the medical supplies it needs for the US. Here are the other key developments from the last few hours: There are 10,393,467 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, and 508,392 deaths. Dr Anthony Fauci told US senators he “would not be surprised” if cases go up to 100,000 a day. He said the US is “going in the wrong direction” in its handling of the coronavirus pandemic and warned that the death toll “is going to be very disturbing” unless officials intervene, and urged Americans to wear masks and practice social distancing in public spaces. Speaking in Delaware, Joe Biden said the pandemic is unlikely to have subsided by January 2021, and if he’s elected. “On the day I’m sworn in, I’ll get right to work implementing all aspects of the response that remain undone,” he said. India’s prime minister has warned citizens against “negligence” in following coronavirus guidance. Narendra Modi raised concerns that social distancing and hand washing advice was being ignored as daily new cases in the country remain close to 20,000. The United Nations has called on governments to provide nearly $10bn in aid for Syria, as the war-torn country’s humanitarian crisis deepens amid the coronavirus pandemic. The UN said it needed $3.8bn to help 11 million people in Syria – where food prices have soared – and a further $6.04bn to help the 6.6 million Syrians who have fled the country. Greece should prepare for a “very difficult” tourist season, the country’s prime minister has said. Tourism officials say the country – which usually makes around 18.1 billion a year from tourism – would be lucky if revenues hit the 4-5 billion euro mark this year. Face masks in public spaces are to be made mandatory in Toronto. The city’s mayor and medical officer announced the rules, which will take effect on July 7 if the city council passes the motion today, on Tuesday. The United States is not on a European Union “safe list” of destinations for non-essential travel. From Wednesday, the EU will allow travel to 14 countries beyond its borders.
53	Frank Lampard admitted his team are far from the finished article after Chelsea’s 3-2 defeat at West Ham meant they missed out on the chance to leapfrog Leicester into third place in the Premier League. Andriy Yarmolenko’s late goal secured a priceless victory for West Ham after Willian had scored twice for Chelsea, ensuring David Moyes’s side moved three points clear of the relegation zone. But having defeated Manchester City to crown Liverpool as champions and also beaten Leicester to reach the FA Cup semi-finals, Lampard admitted this setback was an indication of how far his team must progress if they are to challenge for the title next season. “It’s a sign of where we are – we have a lot of hard work to do to get to where we want to be,” he said. “The reason the rest of us are chasing Liverpool and Man City is because of the consistency they have developed so that is what we have to work towards. It’s obviously frustrating but if we are in that position it’s how you bounce back and move forward.” Poor defending from Chelsea allowed West Ham to go ahead thanks to goals from Tomas Soucek and Michail Antonio before Willian’s equaliser from a free-kick. Yarmolenko’s goal in the 89th minute means Chelsea still trail Leicester by a point after their defeat to Everton, with Manchester United and Wolves two points behind Lampard’s side. He refused to blame his players for their first defeat since the restart and said they must look ahead to Saturday night’s game against Watford at Stamford Bridge. “I’ve not been let down by my defenders – we’ve made mistakes in the buildup to the goals, not just defenders, which cost us the game,” Lampard said. “I wouldn’t call it a wake-up call because every game is different. This wasn’t a huge surprise – if you know the Premier League and you make mistakes, it can happen. We have to accept it and move on.” West Ham’s victory was their first since the restart and Moyes said it was fully deserved after Soucek’s goal had been controversially ruled out for VAR in the first half. “One win is not enough – we have to win more if we’re still going to be a Premier League club,” he said. “But after the performance that we saw Chelsea put in against Manchester City, it was an outstanding result for us.”
54	Leo Messi was the first off the pitch, heading down the tunnel alone as Barcelona’s anthem began echoing around a stadium as vacant as the look in the team’s eyes. It was almost midnight on the last day of the financial year and it was over. Looking down at the scene were the club’s directors who had made it to July, surviving another season, but only just. Any lingering hope of winning La Liga had gone. Ten days before Gerard Piqué said it would be “very difficult”. Now, held 2-2 by Atlético Madrid, a third draw in four, it was virtually impossible. At the side of the pitch Sergio Busquets said something about mathematical possibility, which is what players say when they have nothing else. Barcelona had decided to sack manager Ernesto Valverde when they were top and without a replacement ready; six months on, they are second, a point behind Real Madrid having played a game more. There are five left and no one is looking forward to those much. That is not the worst of it, either. Defeat, not definitive yet, is one thing; decline is another. Capitulation had been coming for a long time; they were flawed when they were first and well before that. When the final whistle went Quique Setién turned to the bench, picked up some papers and stood there for a moment. A disciple of Johan Cruyff , this is not how he imagined managing Barcelona. And yet nor can he have been entirely surprised, not least because Cruyff fought battles too and Setién knew he had not been Barça’s first choice. He has problems of his own but most of his team’s precede him. Not least because they are not just the team’s problems; they are the club’s. Against Atlético, Antoine Griezmann, Barcelona’s third most expensive player in their history, had been on the pitch four minutes. Ousmane Dembélé, their second most expensive, was not there: injured again, his career in Catalonia slipping from his control or anyone else’s. And as for their most expensive signing, Philippe Coutinho is in Munich on loan because they couldn’t sell him. He will be back soon and they will try to get rid of him again, another plan in pieces. Coutinho was supposed to replace Andrés Iniesta, just as Arthur Melo was supposed to replace Xavi. But on Monday Arthur joined Juventus, travelling to Turin still in his Barça tracksuit. They were in a hurry, after all. Juventus paid €72m plus €10m in add-ons Barcelona said but this was effectively a swap deal with Miralem Pjanic, an act of accountancy more creative than the players and driven by finance not football. Driven, above all, by the board’s determination to escape liability for the budgetary shortfall, their short-term survival secured at the cost of deepening and postponing problems until another day. They are not the only successors lost, the only plans gone awry. Neymar, the man who would play alongside and eventually replace Messi, should be taking the lead now. But he became impatient and Barcelona were powerless to prevent him leaving in 2017. They have become locked in a spiral of loss and nostalgia ever since, desperate to make amends to the point where they tried to bring him back again but did not have the money. Worse, the €222m had long been spent, even though one director had insisted that doing so would be an irresponsibility for which they would have to resign. No one did. Not for that, anyway: this spring, six directors walked out, meaning 11 of the 21 board members who began Josep Maria Bartomeu’s mandate have gone. There have also been four sporting directors and as many directors of communication. And it goes back further. In 2014, Luis Suárez, Ivan Rakitic and Marc-André ter Stegen signed. Since then, Barcelona have brought in 28 players for almost €1bn. Those are the ones who did come – the failed pursuit of a striker ended up being comic – and none are an unqualified success. None were easy to shed either, so they sold those they could, not always those they should. Arda Turan was a Barcelona player until Wednesday morning. He has not played for the club in three years. Griezmann eventually came a year later than planned and with no natural slot in the team, early hope floating off with the confetti. Asked why he introduced the Frenchman only in the 90th minute on Tuesday night Setién said the alternative was not to put him on at all. He talked through the other players, the desire to keep Messi and Luis Suárez on, and concluded it was difficult to introduce Griezmann without “destabilising” the team. A more telling line is hard to imagine. The side grow old together and weaker, on the pitch at least. Off it they are powerful still. Ansu Fati is 17, Riqui Puig is 20. They may well be Barcelona’s future; too many of those alongside them are Barcelona’s past. Piqué, Suárez, Messi, and Vidal are 33, Rakitic is 32, Busquets and Alba are 31. And still responsibility lies with them. It lies with Messi most of all, a weight he does not always welcome but one he will not, and should not, renounce. He has watched the peak of his career slip by without a European Cup in five years. Sometimes he must look around and wonder what he has done to deserve this. Actually, perhaps that is a more pertinent question than it first appears. There is a deference to him that dominates everything and is not without problems that will take a brave man to broach. Soon, though, someone must. Problems dominate everything, so many they cannot fit on this page, so bad that Messi’s exasperation has been made public. Confrontations between players and board over pay cuts. The Barçagate scandal, the club accused of being behind sock accounts attacking opposition figures and their own players. Messi calling out the sporting director Eric Abidal for blaming the players over Valverde – a man whose ability to keep a lid on tension was not apparent until he had gone, a man some miss now. His charisma may have been quiet but it was there; coaching this team – this club – is not as simple as many imagined. “It is what it is,” ran Valverde’s now infamous phrase, drawing intense criticism, but what if he was right? What if Xavi, Koeman, and Pochettino were right when they said no? Setién stepped into the middle. He had seen what Valverde did; soon, perhaps, he saw why Valverde did it. Fault lines open easily at Barcelona, widened by the pressure that surrounds everyone. At Celta, footage showed Messi, Suárez and Rakitic apparently ignoring Setién’s assistant, Eder Sarabia. Reports alleged discussions in the dressing room. On Monday night, the president visited Setién’s house. During an unexpectedly revealing and startlingly introspective press conference, Barcelona’s manager said: “I wasn’t an easy player to handle either,” adding: “I have to free my conscience. “I have no problem admitting this is a new situation for me and I’m in one of those moments when you’re finding out many things. Bit by bit you do what you want to do. We all have to give a bit of ourselves, players included, for the good of the team. This is a team and it has to act as one.” It may be facile, opportunistic, but a photo from Tuesday night brought that comment to mind once more, perhaps offering a portrait of where they are. During a drinks break, Atlético’s players are pictured gathered around Diego Simeone, as one. Barcelona’s are dispersed. Some substitutes linger, others sit in the stands. Among them is Arthur, just sold to Juventus to save the board from a crisis of their own making on the eve of meeting Atlético, a game the president does not attend. One that starts with the league title at stake and ends with it virtually gone, each player going their own way at the full-time whistle. Messi was the first off. The humiliation burning, Griezmann was the last. He had friends to talk to on the other team.
55	The Rolling Stones, Sir Paul McCartney and Dua Lipa are among 1,500 musicians and bands calling for the government to take urgent action to help live music in Britain avoid collapse due to the coronavirus pandemic. A letter signed by artists, including Ed Sheeran, Rita Ora, Coldplay, Annie Lennox and Sam Smith, warned that the UK could lose its prime spot on the world’s musical stage unless the government commited to supporting businesses and set out a timetable for reopening live music venues. The performers said venues are at risk of mass insolvencies and that hundreds of thousands of jobs could be lost. The joint letter to the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said: “Live music has been one of the UK’s biggest social, cultural, and economic successes of the past decade. But, with no end to social distancing in sight or financial support from government yet agreed, the future for concerts and festivals and the hundreds of thousands of people who work in them looks bleak. Until these businesses can operate again, which is likely to be 2021 at the earliest, government support will be crucial to prevent mass insolvencies and the end of this world-leading industry.” Many of the artists who signed the letter, including George Ezra, Depeche Mode, Iron Maiden, Lewis Capaldi, and Little Mix, were due to perform this summer at festivals in Britain, including at Glastonbury, All Points East and Parklife. The artists said the live music industry supports 210,000 jobs across the UK, and that venues, concerts, festivals and production companies added £4.5bn to the economy in 2019. The letter called on Dowden to deliver a three-point strategy for restarting the live music sector. It asked for a clear, conditional, timeline for reopening venues without social distancing, a comprehensive business and employment support package, and VAT exemption on ticket sales. Lipa said: “It’s incredibly important for artists like myself to speak up and support the live music industry in the UK. From the very start, playing live concerts up and down the country has been a cornerstone for my own career. “I am proud to have had the chance to play through all the levels ... small clubs, then theatres and ballrooms and into arenas, and of course festivals in between each touring cycle. “But the possibility for other emerging British artists to take the same path is in danger if the industry doesn’t receive much needed government support in the interim period before all the various venues, festivals and promoters are ready and able to operate independently again.” In a coordinated campaign starting on Thursday artists and venues will post on social media photographs and films of their last gig or event with the hashtag #LetTheMusicPlay. Fans are also encouraged to post about the last gig they attended in a show of support. Emily Eavis, co-organiser of the Glastonbury festival, said: “The UK’s venues, festivals, performers and crew bring so much to this country’s culture and economy, but they are now facing desperate financial challenges. If the government doesn’t step up and support the British arts we really could lose vital aspects of our culture forever.”
56	Mental health appears to be a significant factor behind referrals from the NHS to Prevent, the government’s controversial anti-radicalisation programme, a UK-based medical charity says. In an 18-month study, researchers at Medact found that a significant proportion of NHS referrals to Prevent came from mental health trusts or mental health departments. Freedom of information responses from a sample of four mental health trusts showed 89 referrals to Prevent in the two years to March 2019, compared with a combined 90 referrals from 18 non-specialist trusts in the same period. Within the 18 non-specialist trusts, 40 referrals came from mental health departments in the two-year period, compared with 45 combined from all other departments. Five referrals were not classed by department. Public sector workers, including doctors, nurses and other health professionals, are under a legal duty to refer any individual they suspect could be vulnerable to radicalisation to Prevent. Of the total 5,738 referrals in the year to March 2019, 10% came from the health sector. The report, titled False Positives: the Prevent Counter-Extremism Policy in Healthcare, concluded that mental health patients were disproportionately represented among Prevent referrals. “While further research is urgently needed, it appears that mental health may be a significant factor related to Prevent referral,” the report said. The conclusion echoed research published in the British Medical Journal in 2016, which similarly found that mental health trusts in England recorded much higher levels of referrals. Likewise, counter-terrorism police concluded in 2016 that about 50% of individuals referred to Prevent might have had some kind of mental health condition. The findings come at a time of increased interest in the links between mental health and violent extremism or terrorism after a series of high-profile incidents in the UK involving lone attackers. In the year to March 2019, there were 5,738 referrals to Prevent, although only 10% ultimately received specialist intervention in relation to radicalisation concerns, through what is known as the channel process. Medact found that in some NHS trusts this “false positive” rate was much higher, with 98% of referrals in one London-based trust not progressing to the channel process. The study found that Prevent referrals could worsen a subject’s mental wellbeing, and in some cases appeared to be a key cause of a new mental health condition. A former Prevent lead in an English primary care trust, and ex-channel panel member, told Medact that a “substantial” proportion of cases he looked at through the channel process – possibly “the majority” – involved “some kind of mental health issues”. In addition, more than half of the Prevent referrals in the case studies gathered by Medact involved pre-existing mental health conditions, including schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder. Medact documented several cases in which Prevent referrals of people being treated for pre-existing mental health conditions damaged relationships between health practitioners and patients. In one, according to the psychiatrist involved, a Prevent referral set back the recovery of an “extremely paranoid and unwell” schizophrenic man by damaging the development of a trusting relationship between patient and health staff. In another case, a GP referred her “acutely depressed” and “psychotic” patient to Prevent before mental health services, even though she did not believe the patient posed a threat. The report said there was evidence of Prevent referrals triggering mental health problems, including in individuals with no previous reported history of mental illness. In one case, according to a GP, a schoolboy developed obsessive compulsive disorder as a direct result of the trauma and anxiety caused by his school referring him to Prevent. “Taken together, this qualitative evidence suggests that Prevent referrals can damage people’s physical and mental health in a variety of direct and indirect ways,” the report said. The report author, Hilary Aked, research manager at Medact, said: “Prevent is part of a worrying trend of government seeking to turn health workers into an arm of the security state. It undermines confidentiality and trust between practitioners and their patients. “Our report shows that Prevent is discriminatory, and it will only worsen health inequalities already faced by minority communities. It’s crucial that the Prevent policy in the NHS is repealed.” A government spokesperson said: “Healthcare practitioners recognise Prevent as part of their safeguarding duties, and with over 300,000 patient contacts every day, the NHS has an important role to play in preventing vulnerable people being drawn into terrorism. “A key part of Prevent is to enable frontline staff to recognise and safeguard individuals at risk from all types of radicalisation, referring them to pathways for appropriate support. “Mental health conditions may contribute to a person’s wider vulnerabilities, though the relationship between mental health and radicalisation is complex.”
57	The regulation of gambling has gone “horribly wrong” and should be radically overhauled without delay, a House of Lords committee has urged. Ministers have pledged to review the 2005 Gambling Act in the face of a growing consensus among MPs and addiction experts that legislation passed under Tony Blair’s government is no longer effective. But in a wide-ranging report, a select committee led by former ITV and BBC chairman Lord Grade said sweeping changes could go forward without the need for a review. Proposals include: An end to gambling sport sponsorship. Strict affordability checks on customers. A testing regime to ban addictive new games. A mandatory levy to fund addiction treatment. Speed of online games reduced to match real casinos. Tough controls on “free bets” and bonus inducements. The committee on the social and economic impact of the gambling industry demanded an end to the UK’s “lax regulation”, pointing to statistics suggesting a third of a million people, 55,000 of them children, are problem gamblers, with up to 2 million people affected by their addiction. “Nobody is up for banning all gambling, we just want to reduce the harm, reduce the suicides, reduce the misery of the people in the ripple effect of problem gambling,” said Lord Grade. “We’re attacking part of the market that has gone very horribly wrong.” The Department for Digital, Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) has yet to set out a timetable for gambling reform, despite cross-party support for change. The committee called for urgent action, saying that DMCS had “seldom been proactive, and sometimes has been more obstructive than reactive” in addressing gambling harm. Some of its recommendations, such as an 18+ age limit on the National Lottery, require amendments to the Gambling Act but most only require changes to other legislation, meaning they could go ahead before the review. One of the more eye-catching proposals is a ban on sport sponsorship, including logos on football shirts, stadium naming rights and pitchside hoardings. Clubs outside the top tier of football, some of which are heavily reliant on gambling sponsorship money, would be given until 2023 to wean themselves off it. The Lords echoed recent criticism of the Gambling Commission by the Public Accounts Committee and National Audit Office. They called for the regulator’s £19m budget to be increased to help rein in an industry that takes more than £11bn a year from gamblers. The regulator should make more use of its powers to fine companies and remove their licences to operate, they said. It should also impose tough new affordability checks, limit stakes on certain online products and implement a testing regime that could ban new products if they are deemed too dangerous. Online table games such as roulette should be slowed down so that they cannot be played any faster than real casinos, the report said. The Gambling Commission acknowledged it was underfunded but said it was “working to improve” and would soon publish measures to tackle addictive features in games and tighten up affordability checks. The committee also called for an end to inducements such as “free bets” or bonuses unless customers opt in to receiving them. It follows widespread concern about controversial VIP schemes, which have featured in a string of cases in which vulnerable people lost large amounts of money and in some cases took their own lives. “The behaviour of some gambling operators, where vulnerable people were targeted with inducements to continue gambling when the operators knew they could not afford to, shocked the committee,” said Lord Grade. Research has shown that around 60% of the industry’s income is derived from people with a severe or moderate gambling disorder. The lengthy report includes a string of proposals, some of which could be enacted by the end of September, such as classifying “loot boxes” in video games as gambling. The lords joined calls for a mandatory levy on profits to fund addiction research, education and treatment, amid mounting concern about industry influence on how its voluntary donations are spent. They also want to see a gambling ombudsman set up to resolve disputes between customers and companies. The Betting and Gaming Council, the industry’s lobbying group, said it did not agree with all the recommendations but said it was already working with the Gambling Commission to implement others. “We would now urge the government to bring forward their planned review of the Gambling Act without delay and to work with the industry on an evidence-led approach to future regulation,” said a spokesperson. DCMS said: “We are absolutely committed to protecting people from the risks of gambling related harm and have been clear that we will review the Gambling Act to ensure it is fit for the digital age.”
58	The British government should prioritise spending on green projects to create jobs and kickstart the economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis, the International Monetary Fund’s chief economist has said. Gita Gopinath, the IMF’s economic counsellor, said that mounting unemployment triggered by the Covid-19 crisis would require swift action to prevent lasting damage, and that spending on low-carbon projects could be used in response. Speaking to MPs on the commons Treasury committee, she said countries such as the UK had an opportunity to “do public investment that also addresses the need for a greener planet, and at the same time as a jobs-rich recovery”. Boris Johnson outlined plans this week to bring forward investment in projects worth £5bn – including roads, bridges, hospitals and schools to reboot Britain’s economy. However, the prime minister was criticised for not spending more or making enough of a priority of green projects. Gopinath said countries had no option but to tackle global heating and that responding to Covid-19 presented them with an opportunity to do so. “For many countries we can see a very good argument for them to undertake public investment spending, because this is going to be a crisis where people are going to hold back spending for a while. The private sector will hold back from spending for a while, so there is a role for public investment,” she said. Gopinath was speaking alongside Laurence Boone, the chief economist of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and both economists from the influential international organisations said Britain needed to tackle rising unemployment by ramping up support for people losing their jobs. Gopinath said a temporary increase in unemployment benefits was among options ministers should consider. Boone said reviewing social protection schemes and increasing funding for training was also key to supporting workers. Investing in a green economic recovery could create as many as 1.6m new jobs in Britain as the Covid-19 crisis subsides, according to a report published on Thursday by the Institute for Public Policy Research. Calling on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to use his summer economic update next week to prioritise the creation of new low-carbon jobs, it said three quarters of adults in a survey believed the government should spend more on fighting global heating. The IPPR warned that without government intervention, unemployment could rise by more than 2.1 million to almost 10% of the workforce. Setting out a plan to create jobs and tackle the climate emergency, it said 560,000 new roles could be created by increasing funding for the energy efficiency of homes. As many as 700,000 jobs could be created in social care, while 230,000 jobs could be created by investing in sustainable public transport – such as walking and cycling infrastructure, and electric vehicle charging points. As many as 46,000 jobs could also be created with the help of more funding for tree planting and peatland restoration. Luke Murphy, IPPR associate director, said: “Our report finds that clean recovery investments are good for jobs and good for the environment – and what’s more, the public agree.”
59	California’s governor has ordered the closure of all recently reopened bars, and halted indoor operations of restaurants, movie theaters, museums and zoos for the majority of residents following a surge in coronavirus cases. The order affects 19 counties, amounting to 70% of California’s population, with some of the counties on the governor’s list among the most populous in the state: Los Angeles, Sacramento and Santa Clara. “The bottom line is the spread of this virus continues at a rate that is particularly concerning,” Gavin Newsom said on Wednesday. California has seen 5,898 new cases in the past 24 hours and recorded 110 deaths. The positivity rate over the past 14 days increased from 4.6% two weeks ago to 6%. Newsom issued the order after much of the state’s economy had cautiously reopened, operating under new guidelines that allowed for social distancing. Newsom noted in the Wednesday briefing that an uptick in cases was to be expected. “As we open our economy, as more people mix, we’re going to see an increase in spread,” he said. “This was anticipated the day we advanced our efforts to curb the spread of this virus.” But conditions in the 19 counties under the new order require more vigilance, Newsom said, especially ahead of the Fourth of July holiday weekend, when people will want to go out to celebrate. Ahead of the festivities, he encouraged – but did not order – local jurisdictions to cancel their annual firework displays, as San Francisco, Los Angeles and Sacramento already have. And while Newsom refrained from closing state beaches over the weekend, he will close the parking lots. “We recognize that all the enforcement in this space is really just about people doing the right thing, which is the default of 99.9% of us,” Newsom said. “We want to do the right thing, we want to be responsible, and at the same time, we want to be respected. I deeply respect people’s liberty, their desire to go back to the way things once were, but I cannot impress on you more that our actions have an impact on other people.” The counties under Newsom’s order are spread throughout the state and are varied in demographics, industry and landscape. Imperial county, a small southern block of desert bordering Arizona with a population of 181,000, has seen an elevated transmission rate, possibly from residents traveling to and from Mexico for work and healthcare as well as from an outbreak at a meatpacking facility, according to public health officials. The surge in Fresno county, a rural swath of the Central Valley with a population of 999,000, can most likely be attributed to an outbreak at the Avenal state prison, in addition to several outbreaks at skilled nursing facilities. Solano, a Bay Area county next to Sacramento with a population of 448,000, is experiencing an increase in hospitalizations stemming from a large outbreak among vineyard workers, who live in the area but work in nearby Napa and Sonoma counties. And Los Angeles county, whose population makes up more than a quarter of the state’s entire population, recently surpassed the 100,000 cases. Los Angeles has been home to the largest number of coronavirus cases in the state since the pandemic began, with public health officials attributing this in part to high levels of testing. In total, California has had 222,917 cases of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, and 5,980 deaths. Newsom’s order comes as governors across the country were forced to pump the brakes on reopening their economies, after five states set record highs in reported cases, and North Carolina and South Carolina set records in hospitalizations. On Monday, Doug Ducey, Arizona’s governor, ordered bars, nightclubs, gyms, movie theaters and water parks around the state to be closed for at least 30 days. Greg Abbott, Texas’s governor, issued a similar order last week. And on Wednesday, New York City announced it was pulling back on plans to reopen restaurants for indoor dining.

61	Ministers have been accused of not taking seriously the threat posed to black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) Britons by Covid-19, after the release of an official review of the issue was delayed. The report was commissioned to analyse how factors such as ethnicity, obesity and gender can affect people’s vulnerability to Covid-19 but has already missed the publication deadline set for the end of May. Health bosses sought “insight” after it was reported that deaths among BAME communities were disproportionately high. “It is unacceptable that this review should be delayed without a given date for its publication. BAME communities need answers,” said Marsha de Cordova, the shadow women and equalities secretary. Announcing the review’s launch in early May, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: “We recognise that there has been a disproportionately high number of people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds who have passed away, especially among care workers and those in the NHS.” On Monday night, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) denied reports the delay was down to official concerns of potential civil unrest linked to global anger over the death of George Floyd, an African American man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck. “Ministers received initial findings today. They are being rapidly considered and a report will be published this week,” a spokeswoman said. Citing an unnamed government source, Sky News had reported that the review’s release had been pushed back because of “worries” around “current global events”. The source was quoted as saying there were concerns in Whitehall about the “close proximity to the current situation in America”, where protesters are demanding an end to police violence against black people. The source reportedly said it would be a “bad combination” if the review was released amid such tensions. PHE would initially say only that the “report will be published shortly”. DHSC later added: “It is not true to say this has been delayed due to global events.”
62	Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Pakistanis urged to ‘live with the virus’ Pakistanis are being urged to “live with the virus” as the country’s prime minister, Imran Khan, pushes ahead with a plan to lift lockdown restrictions despite rising infections and deaths, citing the economic losses being suffered. The nation of 220 million has reported 72,160 cases and 1,543 deaths, which jumped lately to as high as 80 a day. Khan said his government has given cash handouts to the poor, which wasn’t possible to continue on such a large scale, adding around 130 million to 150 million people were adversely affected by the shutdowns. Trump no longer in regular contact with public health expert Anthony Fauci, the US government’s top public health expert and Covid-19 task force member, says he is no longer in frequent contact with the president. Asked whether Donald Trump talks to him often about Covid vaccine work, he said: “No ... As you probably noticed, that the task force meetings have not occurred as often lately. And certainly my meetings with the president have been dramatically decreased.” Egypt confirms 1,399 new cases Egypt has confirmed 1,399 new cases, the country’s health ministry says; the first time it has decelerated for a week. That is down from 1,536 reported the day before, but still almost double the number on the same day a week ago. Egypt has reported a total of 26,384 cases, of which 6,297 have recovered and 1,005 died, the ministry said. Known global cases exceed 6.2m According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 6,246,042 people are known to have been infected and at least 374,452 are known to have died since the outbreak began. The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the true scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and recording regimes around the world, as well as suspected undercounting.
63	Tens of thousands of Britons who suffer from “suicide headaches” face years of delay in getting diagnosed because GPs often mistake their symptoms for a migraine, new research reveals. Cluster headache, the medical term for the condition, is as common as but much less well known than other neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson’s disease. One in 1,000 people have it. It involves excruciating pain that can last for anything between 15 minutes and three hours. It is known as “suicide headache” because 64% of sufferers think about taking their own life. A study published in the British Journal of General Practice paints a picture of patients forced to wait a long time to have their cluster headache correctly identified and begin treatment. “It [the delay] used to be nine-plus years, although still it is around three to four years on average, but for some it may be 20-plus years,” said Dr Fayyaz Ahmed, a consultant neurologist at Hull University teaching hospital and a co-author of the paper. Prof Lisa Dikomitis, a medical sociologist at Keele University who led the research, added: “For some patients we interviewed, it was many years. It often depends on the GP and how quickly the patient can be referred. Many of the patients we interviewed thought they had migraines.” A cluster headache attack differs from a flare-up of migraine because it cannot be banished by taking a painkiller the way a migraine can. Patients are treated with oxygen instead. Similarly, someone with cluster headache is usually very restless during the incident, whereas a migraine sufferer will lie down motionless in a dark room. Family doctors often misdiagnose cluster headache as many other ailments such as sinusitis, dental problems, tension-related headaches and eyesight trouble. Sufferers end up unnecessarily having teeth extracted or undergoing a sinus washout as a result of misdiagnosis. “Cluster headache is often poorly recognised in primary care. [Our] study shows that patients regularly face long delays before receiving a correct diagnosis. Misdiagnosis, and consequently mismanagement, is common,” said Dikomitis. Their findings come from interviewing eight GPs and eight neurologists working in the NHS in the north of England. “Clinicians acknowledged delays in diagnosis, misdiagnosis and mismanagement of cluster headache,” according to the paper. The condition involves such severe and debilitating pain that most sufferers also experience serious psychiatric illnesses, such as depression, self-harm and suicidal thoughts during the attack, they found. A few have even been sectioned under the Mental Health Act because the headache made them psychotic. Around five people a year in the UK with the disorder kill themselves. Sufferers often have trouble sleeping and holding down a steady job, because they are frequently unwell and suffer from fatigue and sometimes get irritated with colleagues and bosses. Two to three times more men than women suffer from it, though the figure used to be even more predominantly male. Despite the considerable human cost, however, GPs refer only 2% to 3% of people who come to see them about cluster headache to specialist neurology services at hospitals. That is partly because they have wrongly identified it as something else, Dikomitis and colleagues found. An NHS England spokesperson said: “NHS England has developed a specialist support hotline to help GPs make informed clinical decisions for patients suffering with headache-like symptoms, while for more severe cases, the NHS is offering a handheld gadget that relieves the suffering of cluster headaches.” • In the UK and Irish Republic, contact Samaritans on 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org. • In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. • In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. • Other international suicide helplines can be found at www.befrienders.org
64	Michael Bloomberg, the US billionaire, is to donate more than £1m to fund a replacement for residential university summer schools for British disadvantaged pupils, the Sutton Trust has announced. Bloomberg, a former mayor of New York and presidential candidate, said the new online platform to be called Sutton Trust is intended to help the sixth-formers who would have been eligible for a place on the trust’s face-to-face programmes cancelled because of coronavirus. “The coronavirus crisis has presented a whole new set of challenges for students from low-income families, interrupting the school year and cutting off access to resources that help students stay on track – like university application guidance,” Bloomberg said. “Bloomberg Philanthropies has helped more than 70,000 talented low and middle-income students apply to and enrol in top colleges in the US through our virtual advising programme, and we’re glad to support the work that Sutton Trust online is leading in the UK. “A parent’s income should never determine a child’s likelihood of going to university – and with the coronavirus taking a devastating financial toll on families, and casting so much uncertainty into young people’s lives, this work is more important and more urgent than ever before.” The trust said the funding would create online content for students, and a platform for the sixth-formers to receive advice and teaching from the programme’s higher education partners, including Imperial College London and the University of St Andrews. The trust said its residential and face-to-face summer programmes can only reach about 2,000 students each year, while around 6,000 eligible sixth-formers apply. “The new platform and the Bloomberg funding over three years means the 4,000 who currently don’t get any provision will now get support,” a spokesperson for the trust said. The students come from across the UK and have met social mobility criteria, such as eligibility for free school meals or were attending a school with a low progression rate to higher education. Sir Peter Lampl, the trust’s chair and founder, said he was confident that the new platform will be a good substitute for its traditional summer schools. “Our research has shown that the coronavirus has had a major impact on young people and will have a profound effect on their futures. High quality support is needed more than ever. But with face-to-face programmes unable to go ahead, there is a serious gap,” Lampl said. The new platform will include features of the trust’s summer schools, including academic content, guidance on applications and student finance, as well as an insight into university life.
65	Two-thirds of Britain’s police forces caught people driving in excess of 100mph during the first three weeks of the coronavirus lockdown, new data has shown. The extreme speeds were not confined to motorways, as drivers also took the drop in traffic as an invitation to break the law on urban roads, thus endangering lives, police said. The highest speed recorded was 163mph on the M1 in London, 93 miles over the speed limit, according to the Metropolitan police’s lead on road safety, Det Supt Andy Cox. That driver was in a Porsche but Cox said offenders were spotted in all types of vehicles, from across all demographics, and in all speed zones. He urged drivers to think of the dangers to “vulnerable road users” during a period when people were being urged by Boris Johnson to avoid public transport and instead to walk or cycle to work. Police data obtained by the RAC through freedom of information requests revealed that the second highest speed recorded in early lockdown was 151mph on the M62 in West Yorkshire, and the third 140mph on the A14 in Suffolk. RAC road safety spokesman Simon Williams described the speeds as “truly shocking” and warned that motorists travelling this fast have “virtually no time to react should anything unexpected happen”. He went on: “Some drivers have taken advantage of quieter roads to speed excessively, putting the lives of others at risk at the worst possible time. It’s encouraging that so many police forces have taken firm action even during the lockdown, which sends a strong message to other would-be offenders.” Five other forces detected motorists driving at more than 130mph. Cox, the Met’s lead for its Vision Zero initiative to eliminate deaths on the roads, said his team caught a driver doing 134mph in a 40mph zone in Enfield. Tracking cameras showed driving speeds in London were “above the limit on average in all categories from the first part of lockdown to early May”, he added. Data for May showed a tenfold increase in the number of enforcements in the 20mph zone, with 530 drivers caught breaking the limit, compared with just 50 in 2019. There were more than double the number of offences in the 30mph zone, and a near eightfold increase in speeding in the 60mph zones. The figures relate to physical interventions by officers and do not include data from speed cameras. Local councils have also been concerned, warning that speed limits did not change with empty roads. As schools reopen and more people return to work without using public transport, police are urging people to shun drivers who speed, saying it is the single biggest contributor to fatalities in the capital. “I can’t say the increase is a surprise, because we see reckless driving all the time. Too often people say this is about revenue-raising – ‘Why don’t you catch some real criminals?’ – which is offensive to me and my team because we have seen what happens when there are life-changing injuries or deaths and how lives are wrecked. “There has to be a change in social attitudes. In the last 25 years, drink-driving has become socially unacceptable. People won’t get into a car when someone has been drinking, they will take the keys from friends,” he said. “But that is not happening with speeding. The problem is these drivers or their friends don’t understand how dangerous it is, don’t think we will be there or they will caught, or that they will be the ones in an accident.” He said the people caught speeding were likely to be those that would do so anyway but “saw more opportunity in lockdown as the roads were quieter”. Department for Transport figures show traffic was down by two-thirds in the first few weeks of lockdown. Top 10 violations Here are the highest speeds by drivers breaking the limit between 23 March and 13 April, recorded by police forces that provided data to the RAC (speed limit 70mph unless stated): 1 London: 163mph 2 West Yorkshire: 151mph 3 Suffolk: 140mph 4 Northamptonshire: 138mph 5 Gwent: 136mph 6 Staffordshire: 135mph 7 London: 134mph (40mph speed limit zone) 8 Kent: 132mph 9 Humberside: 130mph 10 Scotland: 128mph
66	Images of lockdown England, including one of the busiest places in the world hauntingly stripped of people and noise, are to enter the nation’s historic archive. Historic England has revealed 200 photographs it has chosen as part of the Picturing Lockdown Collection, a project to capture life over the first week of May. Half of them are photographs taken by the public in response to an appeal. They range from home haircuts to people on their phones in supermarket queues to homemade signs in windows including one that reads: “I’m Really Bored.” Fifty photographs were commissioned from 10 contemporary artists including Coralie Datta, who focused on people in Leeds, and Polly Braden, who captured an empty City of London. Braden said cycling into the Square Mile on her hour’s exercise had been an experience of mixed emotions – terrifying that so much money was dripping away but also awe at the epic scale of the emptiness. “It was just really amazing, like cycling on to a film set before the crew arrives,” she said. “It was really eerie. I don’t think I’ve ever noticed how the new glass buildings fit with the old sandstone. You could see the lines right down to the ground because there are no people or cars. “It was so quiet and clean and the buildings were standing taller and more prominent than I had ever noticed them before.” Braden has previously published a book of photographs of the Square Mile so was keen to return. Normally it would have more than 450,000 people commuting there to work. “At the start of May there was no one there, except for the occasional cleaner or homeless person or security guard. Hardly anyone. It was quite incredible and we are never going to see it like that again.” In contrast, Datta has focused on people in her photographs of lockdown life in Leeds, including a poignant photograph of a mother and baby son, born two days before lockdown, which means he has only ever seen his parents and hospital staff. Another image shows three students cheerily using their garden as a gym. Datta said she was interested in people and how they interact with each other. “I saw an interesting thing happen as soon as lockdown started, particularly in Leeds, that people were much more friendly and out in their gardens a lot more.” Unusually, everyone she asked if she could take a picture said yes. “A lot of people remain optimistic and the different way of living has brought some positive things. They are doing things they would not normally do.” Photographing people comes naturally to her, Datta said. “I find photography allows me to be a people-watcher without anyone worrying that you are doing something slightly dodgy.” The remaining 50 photographs were taken by Historic England’s own photography team. They will all enter the Historic England archive, which contains records of England’s historic buildings, archaeology and social history. More than 3,000 photographs were offered by members of the public after a call for submissions. The last time a similar exercise took place was during the second world war. Claudia Kenyatta, the director of regions at Historic England, said: “The fascinating response to our callout sheds light on our collective and individual experiences of lockdown and provides a snapshot into this unusual time that will be accessible for future generations to see and learn from.”
67	Vulnerable people risk being unable to access the money they need to pay for goods and services, unless the government acts to support the “fragile” cash system, the consumer group Which? has warned. The coronavirus crisis has accelerated the adoption of contactless and other cashless transactions across the UK and led to sharp drops in ATM use as more people shop online or opt for what they perceive to be safer payment methods. However, research by Which? found that many of those who had been unable to shop for themselves had used cash to reimburse friends and family who had stepped in to help. A survey of more than 2,000 people carried out for the group found that one in five were helping someone else, either by managing their finances or shopping for food or essentials. Of these, 51% had been reimbursed in cash. The research also found that one in 10 people had tried to pay a retailer in cash and been refused. In March’s budget the government said it would legislate to protect access to cash for as long as people needed it after the Access to Cash Review warned that more than 8 million UK adults would struggle to cope in a cashless society. Debit cards overtook notes and coins as the main form of spending in 2017, and at that point it was predicted that cash would fall to just 16% of payments within a decade. However, the crisis has accelerated the fall in cash use. At the start of April the limit for contactless payments was increased to £45, making it an option for more purchases. Cash machine operators have reported a huge drop in the number of withdrawals. Link, for example, said it saw a 60% fall in April, although it said £1bn a week was still being withdrawn. Which? said the government should act to ensure people could continue to use cash to pay for essential goods and services during the pandemic, including providing information for businesses on how to accept cash safely. It also urged the government to bring forward legislation before people are cut off from cash. Gareth Shaw, head of money at Which?, said: “Failure to do so risks excluding millions of people from engaging in the economy. It’s vital that the already fragile cash system is not left to collapse completely as the UK’s shift to a cashless society accelerates.” Labour’s shadow economic secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, said the research showed the “urgent need” to protect free access to cash. “The impact of lockdown has accelerated the decline in the use of cash overall but it still remains a crucial means of paying for many people,” he said. “Without clear legislation, we risk the creation of cash deserts. We cannot allow financial exclusion of those who rely on cash purchases and face-to-face banking.”

182	Tomie dePaola was ahead of his time in terms of environmental awareness and gender roles. One of the loveliest picture books that I read to my now 40-something children was his Michael Bird-Boy (1975), whose understanding of the role of bees and flowers in the process transformed the practices of Boss Lady, who ran the environmentally unfriendly honey factory. I still have a copy, and the drawings and words are glorious.
183	Art conceived in the name of charity does not have the strongest track record; those with a mind for cultural ephemera wince at the memory of such fundraising musical singles as We Are the World and Do They Know It’s Christmas?. Though these projects may have been organized under the objective of providing aid at a time of desperate need, their maudlin self-satisfaction could not stand up to scrutiny under the usual rubrics used to critique any other release. And so this was the specific strain of dread that Parks and Recreation fans brought to the news of a reunion episode hastily coordinated in order to put together donations for Feeding America, a nonprofit funding a vast network of pantries, soup kitchens and other community-based centers. A show that often lapsed into corniness in its later years seemed primed to return drenched in high-fructose corn syrup with an extra-hefty helping of creamed corn on the side. Add to that the larger political incongruence of a distinctly Obama-era relic reviving itself in the festering dystopia of Trumpism, and the stage was set for a decently-intended minor debacle. What a relief, then, that this “episode” (a term here used loosely to refer to a collection of stitched-together self-taped dialogues recorded from the cast’s respective quarantines) should turn out to be nothing more than it has to – a collection of timely jokes that connect more often than they don’t, reacquainting us in a low-stakes manner with the characters fans have been missing. Things may have changed, faces have developed a few new lines, but the writing staff understands that ultimately it’s just nice to have the gang back together. They let the ensemble bounce off each other without letting external factors get in the way. Most significantly, the reunion episode sheds the political conscience that wedged the regular series into the zeitgeist during the previous presidential administration. A sunny can-do liberalism became Leslie Knope and co’s calling card, an attitude that could not possibly be more out of joint in light of America’s slide into soft fascism and the utter failure of the Democratic party to halt it in any meaningful way. The notion of a cameo from Knope favorite Joe Biden, currently the subject of much discussion regarding accusations of sexual assault, was enough to turn any registered voter’s stomach. Mercifully, the show conceived as “a comedy version of The West Wing” now comes to us from a world without Bidens or Clintons or Trumps, its comedy unsullied by commentary at a time when we all just need a laugh. And so the joke writers do what they do best, and get back to writing jokes. We start with a celebrity pop-in of the welcome variety, with Paul Rudd reprising pampered heir Bobby Newport at his family’s private fox-hunting estate in Switzerland, where he “hasn’t caught any yet – they’re so fast, like zoop! And they’re gone!” After warning of the dangers related to “the coronus”, he turns it over to our pals from Pawnee, who are of course all taking the proper precautions. Their individual check-ins form the logical extension of those “what would X-sitcom’s characters be doing under quarantine?” articles, giving each character a moment fitting what we know about them to our new status quo. Adam Scott’s Ben Wyatt has combined his two great passions by writing a script for a Cones of Dunshire claymation movie, as “punishingly dense” as the board game inspiring it. He’s isolating separately from wife Leslie, who makes the most pointed comment while mentioning that it was “sad, but necessary” that she had to shut down every national park. She’s done her part by starting a bunch of committees and organizing a phone tree, which gives structure to this series of video calls conducted under the in-universe platform of Gryzzl. Once viewers get acclimated to the disjointed comic pacing that results from no two actors sharing the same space, it’s harmless fun. It’s like visiting your hometown to find everything right where you left it, a bit sweet and a bit sad. Nick Offerman’s Ron Swanson still loves meat, and gets one of the biggest laughs by reminding us of the hysterical matrimonial dynamic at play in the Offerman-Mullally household. As wannabe baller Tom Haverford, Aziz Ansari still fixates on seeming with it, name-checking Fortnite and using background filters to place himself in a faux Bali. Dedicated nurse Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones) is on the frontlines, and must quarantine in a “different part of the house” from her husband, Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe), as he donates blood four times each day. Retta’s ever-elegant Donna Meagle situates herself in front of a wall of chromatically arranged sneakers. Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt, their careers having risen most precipitously in the years since the finale, get the least to do. We learn that the Luddgate-Dwyer household has a drum set, but most importantly, Pratt leads the stirring sing-along of Bye Bye, Li’l Sebastian that takes us out. It’s an easy way to conclude with something momentous and cathartic, and yet far from the worst-case scenario as to how this could’ve all gone. The episode succeeds by allowing itself to be little more than a half-hour of humor. It’s never better than when crafting great setups and punchlines for the tertiary faces making quick appearances. (Boozy newswoman Joan Calamezzo has an EGOT because she has been kicked out of all four major awards ceremonies; cologne magnate Dennis Feinstein markets a scent called Miracle Cure; fan-beloved Jean-Ralphio claims to have been “banned from Cameo” for recording his videos naked.) By that same tack, the weakest moment comes when the episode adopts an about-face for the lines: “Things will go back to normal. They just have to.” Most Americans have made their peace with the fact that things will most definitely not snap back to normal when this all ends, and that by no means do they “have to.” In a lesser world, the episode would have been ripe with hollow feel-good platitudes like that one, but someone knew better. As Preston Sturges teaches us by the conclusion of Sullivan’s Travels, people living in times of hardship don’t need to be preached to. We just need a break from all the damned stress, and Pawnee’s finest happily obliged.
184	Why are the origins of the pandemic so controversial? How Covid-19 began has become increasingly contentious, with the US and other allies suggesting China has not been transparent about the origins of the outbreak. Donald Trump, the US president, has given credence to the idea that intelligence exists suggesting the virus may have escaped from a lab in Wuhan, although the US intelligence community has pointedly declined to back this up. The scientific community says there is no current evidence for this claim. This follows reports that the White House had been pressuring US intelligence community on the claim, recalling the Bush administration’s pressure to “stove pipe” the intelligence before the war in Iraq. What’s the problem with the Chinese version? A specific issue is that the official origin story doesn’t add up in terms of the initial epidemiology of the outbreak, not least the incidence of early cases with no apparent connection to the Wuhan seafood market, where Beijing says the outbreak began. If these people were not infected at the market, or via contacts who were infected at the market, critics ask, how do you explain these cases? The Wuhan labs Two laboratories in Wuhan studying bat coronaviruses have come under the spotlight. The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) is a biosecurity level 4 facility – the highest for biocontainment – and the level 2 Wuhan Centre for Disease Control, which is located not far from the fish market, had collected bat coronavirus specimens. Several theories have been promoted. The first, and wildest, is that scientists at WIV were engaged in experiments with bat coronavirus, involving so-called gene splicing, and the virus then escaped and infected humans. A second version is that sloppy biosecurity among lab staff and in procedures, perhaps in the collection or disposal of animal specimens, released a wild virus. Is there any evidence the virus was engineered? The scientific consensus rejecting the virus being engineered is almost unanimous. In a letter to Nature in March, a team in California led by microbiology professor Kristian Andersen said “the genetic data irrefutably shows that [Covid-19] is not derived from any previously used virus backbone” – in other words spliced sections of another known virus. Far more likely, they suggested, was that the virus emerged naturally and became stronger through natural selection. “We propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of Sars-CoV-2: natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic [animal to human] transfer; and natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.” Peter Ben Embarek, an expert at the World Health Organization in animal to human transmission of diseases, and other specialists also explained to the Guardian that if there had been any manipulation of the virus you would expect to see evidence in both the gene sequences and also distortion in the data of the family tree of mutations – a so-called “reticulation” effect. In a statement to the Guardian, James Le Duc, the head of the Galveston National Laboratory in the US, the biggest active biocontainment facility on a US academic campus, also poured cold water on the suggestion. “There is convincing evidence that the new virus was not the result of intentional genetic engineering and that it almost certainly originated from nature, given its high similarity to other known bat-associated coronaviruses,” he said. What about an accidental escape of a wild sample because of poor lab safety practices? The accidental release of a wild sample has been the focus of most attention, although the “evidence” offered is at best highly circumstantial. The Washington Post has reported concerns in 2018 over security and management weakness from US embassy officials who visited the WIV several times, although the paper also conceded there was no conclusive proof the lab was the source of the outbreak. Le Duc, however, paints a different picture of the WIV. “I have visited and toured the new BSL4 laboratory in Wuhan, prior to it starting operations in 2017- … It is of comparable quality and safety measures as any currently in operation in the US or Europe.” He also described encounters with Shi Zhengli, the Chinese virologist at the WIV who has led research into bat coronaviruses, and discovered the link between bats and the Sars virus that caused disease worldwide in 2003, describing her as “fully engaged, very open and transparent about her work, and eager to collaborate”. Maureen Miller, an epidemiologist who worked with Shi as part of a US-funded viral research programme, echoed Le Duc’s assessment. She said she believed the lab escape theory was an “absolute conspiracy theory” and referred to Shi as “brilliant”. Problems with the timeline and map of the spread of the virus While the experts who spoke to the Guardian made clear that understanding of the origins of the virus remained provisional, they added that the current state of knowledge of the initial spread also created problems for the lab escape theory. When Peter Forster, a geneticist at Cambridge, compared sequences of the virus genome collected early in the Chines outbreak – and later globally – he identified three dominant strains. Early in the outbreak, two strains appear to have been in circulation at roughly at the same time – strain A and strain B – with a C variant later developing from strain B. But in a surprise finding, the version with the closest genetic similarity to bat coronavirus was not the one most prevalent early on in the central Chinese city of Wuhan but instead associated with a scattering of early cases in the southern Guangdong province. Between 24 December 2019 and 17 January 2020, Forster explains, just three out of 23 cases in Wuhan were type A, while the rest were type B. In patients in Guangdong province, however, five out of nine were found to have type A of the virus. “The very small numbers notwithstanding,” said Forster, “the early genome frequencies until 17 January do not favour Wuhan as an origin over other parts of China, for example five of nine Guangdong/Shenzhen patients who had A types.” In other words, it still remains far from certain that Wuhan was even necessarily where the virus first emerged. If there is no evidence of engineering and the origin is still so disputed, why are we still talking about the Wuhan labs theory? The pandemic has exacerbated existing geopolitical struggles, prompting a disinformation war that has drawn in the US, China, Russia and others. Journalists and scientists have been targeted by people with an apparent interest in pushing circumstantial evidence related to the virus’s origins, perhaps as part of this campaign and to distract from the fact that few governments have had a fault-free response. What does this mean now? The current state of knowledge about coronavirus and its origin suggest the most likely explanation remains the most prosaic. Like other coronaviruses before, it simply spread to humans via a natural event, the starting point for many in the scientific community including the World Health Organization. Further testing in China in the months ahead may eventually establish the source of the outbreak. But for now it is too early.
185	Even as world leaders gradually consider easing the lockdowns imposed on major economies, the economic consequences of the pandemic are barely started. The airline industry today illustrated that there could be much more pain ahead. Irish budget airline Ryanair said it would cut 3,000 jobs, Aer Lingus is reportedly considering cutting 900 jobs, while Heathrow Airport warned that mass redundancies could also be on the cards. Here are some of the other major developments from today: US stock markets fell after Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on China in retaliation for its role in the coronavirus crisis, citing an unproven theory on its origin. Royal Bank of Scotland took an £800m profit hit because of the pandemic’s economic effects - and it also ended a short-lived experiment to create an app-based bank to rival the likes of Monzo. British households repaid £3.8bn of consumer credit, including £2.4bn on credit cards and £1.4bn on car finance and other personal loans, during March - the largest since records began in 1987 and a sign of the massive drop in consumption prompted by the pandemic. ExxonMobil, the US supermajor oil producer, took a $3bn charge in the first quarter as the coronavirus outbreak pushed it to a $610m loss - its first loss in three decades.

JJ The woes of the US manufacturing sector were laid bare by a PMI reading that was the worst since 2009, as employment prospects in the sector were decimated. The April purchasing managers’ index (PMI) reading was 41.5, down 7.6 points from the March reading of 49.1, according to the US Institute of Supply Management. Economists had expected a reading of 35, far below the 50 mark that denotes expanding output in the sector. IHS Markit’s separate US manufacturing PMI hit 36.1 in April, down from 48.5 in March and the previously released “flash” figure of 36.9. That was the lowest for just over eleven years as well. Binay Chandgothia, portfolio manager at Principal Global Investors, said: A 12.4-point drop in the U.S. PMI is an absolute outlier for a single month. Even during the global financial crisis, it dropped by a max of 5.9 points from September 2008 (44.8) to October 2008 (38.9). However, we’ve seen similar data across global markets over the last few weeks, so there is little shock value in today’s numbers. The markets have already moved beyond analysing the anticipated immediate collapse in economic activity to focusing on the duration of it. While there are some initial signs of stabilisation in indicators that have already dropped precipitously, the markets would like to see continued progress – moving from a stabilisation phase to a recovery phase. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: April saw the manufacturing sector struck hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, with output falling to an extent surpassing that seen even at the height of the global financial crisis. With orders collapsing at a rate not seen for over a decade, supply chains disrupted to a record degree and pessimism about the outlook hitting a new survey high, rising numbers of firms are culling payroll numbers. One for the committed central bank watchers among our readers: Tiff Macklem is the new governor of the Bank of Canada (Mark Carney’s alma mater). Wall Street has followed the lead of London and fallen, after disappointing corporate earnings and Donald Trump’s threat to put tariffs on China in retaliation for its role in the crisis. The US indices: S&amp;P 500 .INX DOWN 55.82 POINTS, OR 1.92 PERCENT, AT 2,856.61 NASDAQ .IXIC DOWN 205.32 POINTS, OR 2.31 PERCENT, AT 8,684.23 DOW JONES .DJI DOWN 422.82 POINTS, OR 1.74 PERCENT, AT 23,922.90 White House adviser Larry Kudlow has been speaking on US television, indicating that the US government is concerned about a lack of transparency from China. There is no rush to put in place new tariffs, he said, and he added that full faith in US debt is sacrosanct - addressing speculation the US government could unilaterally write off China’s massive Treasury debt holdings. Aer Lingus, British Airways’ stablemate, has reportedly told unions it is seeking staff cuts of around 20% due to the coronavirus pandemic. Cuts of that scale at the Irish flagcarrier would be roughly in line with British Airways, which plans to make 12,000 redudancies, about a quarter of its workers. Reuters reported the plans, citing a source close to the talks. It said: Aer Lingus, part of International Airlines Group (IAG), which also owns British Airways, declined to comment, saying it was “continuing to communicate directly with our employees and engage with their representative bodies.” Cuts of 20% would represent around 800-900 staff, with management promising to offer a voluntary redundancy programme, the source said. International Airlines Group, BA and Aer Lingus’s owner, has gained state aid for its Spanish airlines, Iberia and Vueling. The crisis has proved to be something of a reckoning for the oil industry, and ExxonMobil in particular. The company is facing increasing investor pressure to act on the climate crisis, with the Church of England’s investment fund targeting Exxon’s board over their lack of movement to tackle the biggest issue of the time. At the same time, ExxonMobil pretty much missed the shale boom in its own back yard, and debt-fuelled expansion has left it vulnerable. In a symbol of the times, Netflix, last month overtook Exxon by market capitalisation. And that was all before oil prices plunged. One barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the North American benchmark, will set you back less than $20 (even after rising by 6% today). Here are WTI futures prices this year, down from above $60: ExxonMobil, the US supermajor oil producer, took a $3bn charge in the first quarter as the coronavirus outbreak pushed it to a $610m loss - its first loss in decades. Oil producers have been plunged into chaos as the pandemic has drastically reduced demand for energy. US oil prices have even turned briefly negative, in an indication of the strains on the industry. In the first three months of 2020 Exxon’s oil drilling made only $536m, compared to $2.9bn the year before. It is a sign of the strange times that investors around the world are closely following the progress of drug development. The ups and downs of the testing process for remdesivir have caused billions of pounds of money to shift around the world as people hope for an effective antiviral treatment. Shares in the drug’s maker, Gilead, have risen by 29% this year thanks to hopes the drug (previously developed to fight Ebola) will prove effective at fighting Covid-19. On Friday its chief executive said he expected the US Food and Drug Administration to act quickly over the company’s application for approval. Gilead would try to get the drug to as many people as possible if it was approved, he said. “We’re moving very quickly with the FDA,” Daniel O’Day said in an interview with NBC’s Today show, via Reuters. “And I expect that they’re going to act very quickly.” Sterling has slipped to a one-week low against the euro, with analysts blaming Brexit back-and-forth and a general aversion to riskier assets (as evidenced by the stock market selloff). And remember, with many investors in Europe on holiday (even if confined to their homes) it is likely that trading is thinner than normal. The pound lost 0.7% to hit a low of €1.1408. Against the dollar sterling lost 0.5% to hit lows of $1.2525, after gaining strongly yesterday. Reuters’ summary of the latest Brexit shenanigans said: A source close to Britain’s negotiating team said the country was confident it can get a deal on future ties with the European Union if Brussels started treating it as an independent negotiator. But, underlining what sources in Brussels say is an impasse at talks since Britain left the EU in January, French officials later reiterated the 27-nation bloc’s position that London must make concessions for a deal to be reached this year. The two sides have been unable to find any compromise on three main areas - the so-called level playing field guarantees of fair competition, governance and fisheries policy, according to the sources in Brussels and London. Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, a trading platform, said the pound was hit because it is seen as less of a safe haven given the added political risk. He said: The main driver for sterling’s weakness is the change in market sentiment to a more sombre mood, and this won’t support currencies that are more closely linked to risk. Heathrow airport has warned that it may soon follow British Airways in announcing mass redundancies unless the government restores confidence by planning for how flying could restart. The chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said physical distancing measures could not work in airports and common international standards for health controls were needed, such as temperature screening at the entrance to airports and the wearing of face masks throughout the process to ensure a low risk of transmission. Passenger numbers at the UK’s largest airport fell by 97% in April, and Holland-Kaye urged the government to take a lead in developing a global agreement for new measures. Full report here: An interesting side note to Royal Bank of Scotland’s results this morning: as well as a big impairment for bad debts related to the crisis, it is closing its effort to create a digital-first lender to rival the likes of Monzo, Revolut and Starling. That project, named (fairly inexplicably) as Bó, appears to have failed - although RBS said it was just deciding to roll the technology and the brand under its Mettle brand for lending to small businesses. You can read the full report on the RBS results here: The unions have had some time to swallow the bitter pill that is Ryanair’s decision to cut as many as 3,000 jobs. Unite will argue that the decision should be reversed. Referring also to British Airways’ decision to cut 12,000 jobs, Unite national officer for aviation Oliver Richardson said: This is another premature announcement, especially while the government’s job retention scheme remains fully up and running. Ryanair has significant cash reserves and is in a better place than many airlines to cope with the challenges that the Covid-19 pandemic has created. The union also called for the government to intervene with aid for the sector, despite concerns over its environmental impact. Most of Europe may be on holiday today, but for investors in the UK and US May day is not looking very relaxing. The FTSE 100 has lost 2.1% so far, to 5,775 points. The FTSE 250 is down by 1.7%. Markets in the US open in just over three hours, and stock market futures are pointing to heavy declines. The Nasdaq is set to fall 2.5%, the Dow Jones industrial average is expected to lose 1.9% and the S&amp;P 500, the most important benchmark, is set to lose 2%. An interesting story on the insurance industry this morning: the Financial Conduct Authority wants the courts to clarify whether businesses can claim money for business interruption caused by the coronavirus. The Cit watchdog also told all insurers to assess whether they should be giving partial policy refunds during the pandemic. A lot of companies have been distraught to hear that their insurance will not pay out because pandemics are not covered by their terms. Fine print like that has helped the insurance industry to weather the first storm (although recession will likely weigh on their profits eventually). Christopher Woolard, interim chief executive of the FCA, said: We have been clear that we believe in the majority of cases, business interruption insurance was not purchased to, and is unlikely to, cover the current emergency. However, there remain a number of policies where it is clear that the firm has an obligation to pay out on a policy. In addition to this court action, the current emergency has altered the value of some insurance products and we believe that insurers should be looking at both whether their products still offer value. Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, said: This is a welcome step from the FCA and insurers will look to work closely with the regulator to make this process a success. Although the vast majority of business interruption policies do not cover pandemics and the Government has confirmed it will not seek to retrospectively amend contracts, we support any process that will provide clarity and certainty for the minority of customers who are disputing whether they should be covered. Battening down the hatches is the metaphor of choice to describe the Bank of England’s lending data, as the coronavirus storm hit. The data don’t contain any of the government’s emergency loan schemes, so expect much more in April. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: April data will be more illuminating, as they will reflect the impact of the furlough scheme and rising unemployment on households’ incomes and cash holdings. But with all households seemingly running a very tight ship at present, excess savings should accumulate this year, potentially laying the ground for a strong rebound in spending in 2021, when the virus should no longer be a threat. Back on those extraordinary Bank of England data, households paid back £2.4bn of credit card debt - suggesting a huge fall in consumption that almost certainly augurs a recession. There was £5.4bn less lending to households than February - and that was with only a week of full lockdown. April’s data will certainly be interesting... Businesses work differently to households: they took on new loans at record rates as they tried to secure liquidity, while also piling up as much cash as possible in their bank accoutns. Overall sterling money holdings and borrowing - basically what cash companies and households have easily to hand - both rose to their all-time series highs, of £57.4bn and £55.3bn respectively. It is a torrid time for Trafford Centre owner Intu, facing the prospect of companies unable or refusing to pay rent in its shopping centres. The Guardian’s Joanna Partridge writes: Intu says it’s offering monthly rental payments to its retail tenants, but is scathing about “large, well-capitalised brands who have the ability to pay but have chosen not to”. As it grapples with a collapse in rental income, the owner of the Trafford Centre in Manchester and Lakeside in Essex has agreed waivers with some of its lenders, particularly the seven banks which provide its overdraft facility, to prevent potential breaches. It had warned in late March that it would breach the terms on its debt commitments following a collapse in rent. The final reading of IHS Markit’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) confirms what we already knew: it is a dire situation for British factories. The UK’s manufacturing PMI reading came in at 32.6 in April, slightly worse than the flash reading of 32.9. That’s confirmed as a record low. A reading of 50 is expansion, so 32.6 is... very low. There were survey-record contractions in output, new orders, employment and new export business. Lead times for products were also at record levels as supply chain disruptions hit. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit,said: UK manufacturing suffered its worst month in recent history in April, as output, orders books and employment all fell at rates far surpassing anything seen in the PMI survey’s 28-year history. Huge swathes of industry were hit hard by company closures, weak global demand, lockdowns and social distancing measures in response to COVID-19. The only pockets of growth were seen at firms making medical and food products. UK consumers’ credit card debt fell in annual terms for the first time since the Bank of England started tracking the data in 1987 in March, as lockdown froze spending but job guarantees kept millions in work. The annual growth rate of credit card lending fell to -0.3%, the first negative annual growth since the series began. British households repaid £3.8bn of consumer credit, which also includes personal loans, during the month - the largest on record. The amount of credit offered to UK consumers grew at the slowest pace since 2013 in March, while the number of mortgage approvals fell to its lowest in the same period, according to the Bank of England. Mortgage approvals for house purchase fell to 56,200, their lowest level since March 2013. The weak net flows of consumer credit meant that the annual growth rate fell to 3.7% in March, lowest since June 2013. Some interesting moves on currency markets after Donald Trump last night suggested that he might try to hit China with more tariffs in retaliation for its role in the crisis. The US president said last night that a trade deal with China was now of secondary importance to the coronavirus pandemic. He also threatened new tariffs on Beijing and said he had seen evidence for the unproven theory that Sars-CoV-2 originated in a Wuhan infectious disease lab. The prospect of another bout of economic warfare has weighed on the Chinese yuan traded in Hong Kong. The British and Irish aviation industry appears to be running what basketball fans might term a full court press when it comes to requesting state aid: Heathrow Airport’s boss is also asking for help. John Holland-Kaye, according to Reuters, has said the government maybe doesn’t understand how important aviation is for the rest of the economy. Virgin Atlantic (a major presence at Heathrow) may go bust without help, he said. It is disappointing that the UK stands out from other countries in not offering state aid to its airline industry, he said. That echoes the criticisms of Ryanair’s chief executive. However, the UK government has been wary of bailing out airlines and their wealthy shareholders - particularly the billionaire-controlled Virgin Atlantic. There has also been sustained pressure for the government not to help some of the economy’s biggest polluters without conditions that they cut emissions. Heathrow’s comments came as it reported that passenger numbers declined by 18.3% during the first three months of 2020 to 14.6m and are expected to bedown by around 97% in April. Spending has been reduced by £650m. The airport could sustain itself for 12 months even with no passengers, it said. In the barrage of corporate news earlier, we didn’t cover Nationwide’s house price index, which showed that the housing market was actually heating up before the crisis. Annual house price growth increased to 3.7% in April, up from 3% in March-the fastest pace since February 2017 (when annual growth was 4.5%). That was the seventh month of growth in a row. The average price was £222,915. But with something of a caveat: it didn’t take into account the biggest health and economic crisis of our lifetime. Before the lockdown unemployment and borrowing costs were low, while the general election had given buyers some short-lived certainty. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said: It’s important to note that the impact of the pandemic is not fully captured in this month’s figures. This is becauseour index is constructed using mortgage approval data, and there is a lag between mortgage applications being submitted and approved. Indeed, circa 80% of cases in the April sample relate to mortgage applications that commenced prior to the lock-down, and hence before the full extent of the impact of the pandemic became clear. Here are the graphs. Note the recent pick-up: Refunds for customers with cancelled flights will be issued “in a month or two”, O’Leary added. Ryanair’s regional bases (outside major hubs such as Stansted, Gatwick, Manchester and Birmingham) could shut, O’Leary said. There will be final announcement by 1 July, he said: Some of the other regional bases will be very marginal this winter. The return to normal tourism volumes could take as long as three years, O’Leary said. Ryanair’s O’Leary has also hammered home his point about state aid, saying that his airline and others that don’t have government support face a “torrid couple of years”. He said: When we have to come back we’ll have to compete with airlines that have limitless state aid funds to enable them to engage in below-cost selling. It’s going to be a torrid couple of years for airlines like Ryanair, BA, and others who don’t get state aid. It’s going to be a great couple of years for passengers: you will see lower air fares, you will see, certainly this summer, lower hotel prices in place like Spain, Portugal and Italy as they try to recover something of their tourism season. Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary has raised the prospect of further job cuts down the line if the a coronavirus vaccine is not found quickly. The airlines has cut 15% of its staff, and O’Leary said that is “the minumum we need to survive the next 12 months”. Speaking on BBC TV, he added: If a vaccine is found, then clearly the recovery will be stronger. If a vaccine isn’t found then clearly we may have to announce more cuts and deeper cuts into the future. The airline will carry fewer than 140,000 passengers in April, May and June, against pre-crisis forecasts of 42m. For the year passenger numbers will be less than 100m versus the 155m forecast. O’Leary said: While we expect to be back flying some services in July and August we think that the build-up will be slow. Passengers will be wearing face masks, there will be temperature checks at airports. Ryanair’s job cuts will start in July, subject to consultations with unions. The airline said: As a direct result of the unprecedented Covid-19 crisis, the grounding of all flights from mid-March until at least July, and the distorted state aid landscape in Europe, Ryanair now expects the recovery of passenger demand and pricing (to 2019 levels) will take at least two years, until summer 2022 at the earliest. The job cuts will hit pilot and cabin crew jobs mainly. There will also be unpaid leave, and pay cuts of up to 20%, and the closure of a number of aircraft bases across Europe until traffic recovers. Job cuts and pay cuts will also be extended to head office, Ryanair said. Group chief executive Michael O’Leary has extended a 50% pay cut from May until the end of March 2021. Our early report is available here: While British Airways has just moved to lay off 12,000 staff, telling them that there was no government help available, its sister airlines in parent company IAG in Spain have just been granted €1bn in state-backed loans. Iberia has signed a financing agreement for €750m and Vueling for €260m for bank loans guaranteed by the Spanish Instituto de Crédito Oficial, under a Covid-19 scheme set up by Spain to help business. The loans have restrictions to stop the cash being shared with BA or others at IAG. The news came as Ryanair hit out at state aid being given to rival European carriers, with Lufthansa, Air France and KLM expected to share the bulk of around €30bn in bailouts. Ryanair - announcing 3,000 job cuts due to the crisis - said it would challenge this “state aid doping” in European courts. The FTSE 100 has lost 2.1% in the opening minutes of trading. RBS is actually one of only four risers this morning - thanks largely to its continued profitability. Oil companies are dragging back the index, while Ryanair’s budget airline rival easyJet is down 4.9%. Royal Bank of Scotland suffered a near-50% drop in first quarter profits after putting aside £802m to help cover a potential surge in bad debts due to the Covid-19 outbreak, making it the latest UK bank to reveal the mounting cost of the pandemic. The majority state-owned bank announced on Friday that pre-tax profits had fallen to £519m in the first three months of the 2020, compared to just over £1bn a year earlier. It was hurt by the £802m charge, which was driven by forecasts for potential loan losses due to an economic downturn that could make it harder for it retail and business customers to repay their debts. The bank, soon to be renamed NatWest, said: [The group] has significant exposures to many of the commercial sectors that are already being impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, including property, retail, leisure, travel and shipping. It brings the total loan loss charges announced by the five largest UK banks to around £7.4bn for the first quarter. Ryanair is planning to cut 3,000 jobs and reduce staff pay by up to a fifth in response to the Covid-19 crisis, which has grounded flights. The no-frills airline said it did not expect a recovery in passenger numbers or pricing to return to pre-coronavirus levels for at least two years – until summer 2022 “at the earliest”. Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets. It’s May Day, and those stock markets that are not on holiday have started the month with a nasty fall, taking their lead from disappointments last night on Wall Street. Wall Street recorded its best month since 1987 in April - thanks to the timing of the rebound from the market bottom in March - and easing lockdowns is the talk of major economies. Yet corporate earnings are reflecting the grim reality of the costs being borne by companies. In Japan the Nikkei fell by 2.8%. The FTSE 100 is expected to suffer a jolt when it opens in a few minutes’ time. Most other European markets are closed for the holiday, but the following data based on spreadbetting activity gives a rough indication of sentiment: US tech giants Amazon and Apple both disappointed investors last night. Amazon has seen a massive 26% increase in its revenues but there has been a cost: $4bn, to be precise. Meanwhile, Apple refused to give guidance for the current quarter - perhaps understandable in these circumstances, but not reassuring for investors. In the UK, Royal Bank of Scotland has reported an operating profit before tax of £519m and an attributable profit of £288m. However, the bank also took a big impairment to account for the hit from the all-but-certain UK recession: it wrote down £802m eight times higher as a proportion of its loan book than last year. Some £628m relate directly to coronavirus. More details to follow. Ryanair said that it expects some flights to start again in July, but with only half as many passengers in the July to September period as it previously expected.

70	The ongoing coronavirus pandemic will haunt the US economy for a decade, wiping close to $8tn off economic growth, according to new projections released by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) on Monday. In a letter to lawmakers CBO director Phillip Swagel projected the virus will reduce US economic output by 3% through 2030, a loss of $7.9tn. “Business closures and social distancing measures are expected to curtail consumer spending, while the recent drop in energy prices is projected to severely reduce US investment in the energy sector,” Swagel wrote in response to an inquiry from Senator Chuck Schumer. “Recent legislation will, in CBO’s assessment, partially mitigate the deterioration in economic conditions.” Since the pandemic hit the US trillions of dollars have been poured into the economy via government stimulus programs and actions by the Federal Reserve. But the moves have not stopped unemployment soaring to levels unseen since the 1930s Great Depression. So far some 40 million Americans have lost their jobs and on Friday the labor department is expected to announce the unemployment rate reached 20% in May, up from 14.7% in April and just 4.4% in March. Congress is currently debating another $3tn aid package and the renewal of several federal aid programs that are set to expire, including a temporary boost to unemployment benefits that will lapse at the end of July. Republicans have balked at the size of the new stimulus program. Schumer seized on the CBO release to press for action. “In order to avoid the risk of another Great Depression, the Senate must act with a fierce sense of urgency to make sure that everyone in America has the income they need to feed their families and put a roof over their heads,” said Schumer in a statement. “The American people cannot afford to wait another month for the Senate to pass legislation. They need our help now.”
71	We are closing the blog now but coverage will continue over here. Reuters: Police in the Chilean capital Santiago detained more than 50 protesters on Friday, saying they had violated rules intended to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Protesters gathered on the Labor Day holiday in Santiago’s central square, many shouting and displaying signs that railed against abuse of workers and a sharp rise in layoffs in the South American nation. Calls to protest on social media warned those who attended the rally to “use gloves, masks and alcohol gel,” but police said demonstrators had failed to adhere to a nationwide rule against gatherings of more than 50 people. The Carabineros police force said on Twitter that one of the protesters detained had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and was meant to be in isolation for another week. Police officers clad in plastic-screened helmets and olive uniforms herded protesters into police vehicles, while water cannons mounted on trucks nearby dispersed others. Santiago is under partial quarantine, but scattered, small protests against the government of center-right President Sebastian Pinera have persisted in areas not under lockdown. Hello, this is Helen Davidson taking over the live blog for the next little bit. Thanks to Kevin Rawlinson for his coverage over the last few hours. Here is our latest catch-up on recent developments. The top US health official Dr Anthony Fauci will be prevented from testifying to a congressional committee examining the Trump administration’s response to the pandemic next week, the White House has said. The Trump administration claimed it would be “counterproductive” to have individuals involved in the response testify. The White House spokesman Judd Deere told Reuters: While the Trump administration continues its whole-of-government response to Covid-19, including safely opening up America again and expediting vaccine development, it is counter-productive to have the very individuals involved in those efforts appearing at congressional hearings. We are committed to working with Congress to offer testimony at the appropriate time. Trump said after the KCNA report that he will have something to say about Kim at the appropriate time. There has been speculation about Kim’s health after he missed the birth anniversary celebrations of state founder Kim Il Sung on 15 April. The day is a major holiday in North Korea and Kim as leader usually pays a visit to the mausoleum where his grandfather lies in state. A source familiar with US intelligence analyses and reporting told Reuters they could not immediately confirm the KCNA report. The White House and State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. According to Reuters, the news of Kim Jong-un’s appearance in public is now also being reported by North Korean sources. The state news agency KCNA says he attended the completion of a fertiliser plant in a region north of the capital, Pyongyang, on Friday. It is the first report of his public activity since 11 April. According to KCNA, Kim cut a ribbon at the ceremony and those in attendance “burst into thunderous cheers of ‘hurrah!’ for the Supreme Leader who is commanding the all-people general march for accomplishing the great cause of prosperity”. Kim was accompanied by several senior North Korean officials, including his younger sister Kim Yo Jong, KCNA said. Reuters said it could not independently verify the report. The US president Donald Trump has offered an increasingly bleak picture for the US, telling a White House event: Hopefully, we’re going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost, which is a horrible number, nevertheless. Trump, who initially dismissed the outbreak as a “hoax”, has oscillated between claiming that a death toll of between 100,000 and 200,000 people would represent a success and predicting it could be as light as 60,000 or 70,000. According to the latest figures from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 62,406 people have died in the US since the outbreak began. The North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has made his first public appearance in nearly three weeks, according to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency. His absence amid the pandemic had been the cause of speculation, though South Korean and US officials had stressed their belief he was not ill and could simply have been sheltering from the pandemic. More than 70% of virus patients admitted to critical care are men, according to data from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC). The research was based on a sample of 7,542 critically-ill patients confirmed as having Covid-19. It showed 5,389 of the patients were men compared to 2,149 women. The report also found that men were more likely to die in critical care, with 51% dying in care compared to around 43% of women. In total about 49% of the 5,139 patients admitted to critical care who had recorded care outcomes had died, it found. The FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn was careful to note that remdesivir has not received FDA approval as a coronavirus treatment and has only been approved for emergency use on severely ill patients who have been hospitalised. FDA approval requires a much more lengthy review process, while an emergency use authorisation is issued more quickly after the agency weighs the potential risks and potential benefits of a treatment option to help address an emergency situation. Today’s action is an important step in our efforts to collaborate with innovators and researchers to provide sick patients timely access to new therapies where appropriate, while at the same time supporting research to further evaluate whether they are safe and effective. There’s tremendous interest among all parties to identify and arm ourselves with medicines to combat COVID-19, and through our Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program, the FDA is working around-the-clock and using every tool at our disposal to speed these efforts. More people stayed home in Brazil, Japan and Singapore in April as their numbers of cases surged, while people in the United States and Australia returned to parks and jobs as infection rates flattened, data from Google suggest. The latest weekly update of aggregated travel patterns Google collected from its users’ phones points to increased disobedience with lockdown orders in place since March but rising compliance with those issued last month. The US president Donald Trump has told reporters the drug remedesivir has been approved for emergency use to treat coronavirus patients. The FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn clarified that the drug had specifically been cleared for emergency use on those in hospital. The president said the approval represented a “very promising situation” and the White House’s taskforce coordinator Dr Deborah Birx added: “I think this really illustrates what can happen in such a short time.” The emergency approval comes days after Dr Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, expressed cautious optimism about the results of a remdesivir drug trial. The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery. What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus. Albania is relaxing some of its restrictions from Monday, its prime minister Edi Rama has said. It will enlarge its area of green zones and let taxis travel between cities. Then, from 11 May, it will allow shopping centres to open and cars to travel without permits. While still enforcing an afternoon-to-dawn curfew, Albania has eased its restrictions this week, letting many retailers open except for bars and restaurants, though they may offer deliveries. Some people wore masks, others did not. On 12 March, two weeks after Australia declared the coronavirus would become a pandemic and 47 days after the first case in Australia was detected in Melbourne, the World Health Organisation made it official. That night, in Melbourne, organisers of the Australian Grand Prix were scrambling to keep the event open despite an 11th hour order from Victoria’s chief health officer that they could run the race but had to turn spectators away. It would be the first major event in Australia to be cancelled by the coronavirus. Within 24 hours, almost every other flagship event planned for the next month would follow suit. This is the first 50 days of the shutdown. Yemen has reported its first case in Taiz governorate, raising the number of diagnosed infections to seven with two deaths in the war-torn country that lacks medical care. The United Nations says it fears the virus could be spreading undetected among an acutely malnourished population with inadequate testing capabilities. The national emergency coronavirus committee tweeted: A new confirmed case of coronavirus was reported, the first in (southwestern) governorate of Taiz, in a man in his 40s. Yemen recorded its first case in southern Hadharamout province on 10 April. On Wednesday, it announced five infections in the southern port of Aden, with two deaths. Hundreds of people have gathered in a Berlin square to mark May Day in defiance of the ban on public gatherings of more than 20, exposing deep frustrations with physical distancing rules. Reuters reports that police blocked roads around a square in Kreuzberg, traditionally the centre of left-wing May Day protests to prevent more people from joining what a police spokeswoman called an illegal gathering. Leftist groups had called for the demonstration to denounce capitalism and urge solidarity, especially with refugees seeking to reach Europe. They had urged participants to wear masks and stay at least 1.5 metres apart. “Saving lives is not a crime,” read a giant red banner dangled from a window, in a reference to the rescue ships saving refugees trying to reach Europe. Most of those gathered appeared to be keeping a safe distance from one another. Riot police watched from a distance as a police helicopter circled overhead. “We have prevented the parade from growing bigger and are using loudspeakers to urge people to disperse,” the police spokeswoman said, adding that the situation remained largely peaceful. An overwhelming majority of Germans back the lockdown enforced by the country’s 16 states and backed by the chancellor Angela Merkel, despite its heavy toll on the economy, which is expected to contract by a record of more than 6% this year. The World Health Organization (WHO) has reiterated that the virus is of natural origin after the US president’s uncorroborated claims he had seen evidence it originated in a Chinese lab, AFP reports. Scientists believe it jumped from animals to humans, emerging in China late last year, possibly from a market in Wuhan selling exotic animals for meat. Trump has refused to offer any details of or evidence for his claim that he has proof that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was actually the source of the outbreak. Asked about Trump’s claim during a virtual press conference, WHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan stressed that the UN health agency had “listened again and again to numerous scientists who have looked at the sequences” of the virus. “We are assured that this virus is natural in origin,” he said, reiterating a stance the UN agency has expressed previously. Varadkar’s widely expected announcement was made in a solemn address that channelled the Vera Lynn song We’ll Meet Again. Varadkar announced two tweaks to restrictions that are due to expire on 5 May: the 2km limit on exercise will extend to 5km and people aged over 70 who are cocooning will be allowed to exercise outdoors. I know it’s been difficult. The uncertainty about when things will get back to normal and the fear of the virus itself. As a nation, our physical health has been attacked, our mental health eroded. Our economy battered and our society put to the ultimate test. Restrictions were working and had saved thousands of lives but progress could be “swept away” with premature relaxation, he said. It will take some time for our lives to get back to normal. To a new normal. But it will happen. The reopening will have five stages, three weeks apart, starting on 18 May. If Covid-19 surges, it may be necessary to reverse, said Varadkar. In the first phase outdoor workers, including builders and gardeners, will be able to return to work. Hardware shops, garden centres and other selected categories will be allowed to reopen and small outdoor gatherings will be permitted. “Not long from now, some summer night, we will see our friends again,” said Varadkar. US meat production has continued to decline as the coronavirus crisis forces the shutdown of more processing facilities, sparking fears of shortages at grocery stores nationwide, writes Guardian US reporter Kenya Evelyn. The US Department of Agriculture’s weekly report found that from 27 April, beef production was down nearly 25% compared to the same time last year. Pork production was down 15%. While Sonny Perdue, the agriculture secretary, has said the US has “plenty of food for all of [its] citizens”, fewer pigs are being slaughtered at processing plants, down by nearly 50% since mid-March. Meat processing companies have paused operations as some workers have tested positive for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Last month, Tyson Foods, one of America’s largest meat producers, warned “the food supply chain is breaking” in a full-page ad in newspapers including the New York Times. “There will be limited supply of products,” the Arkansas-based company said, until it can reopen closed facilities. Restriction on movement are to continue for several more weeks in Ireland, although over-70s may now leaves their homes to exercise, Leo Varadkar has said. In an address to the nation on Friday evening, the Taoiseach said most restrictions would remain in place until 18 May, “to weaken the virus further so it doesn’t make a comeback,” the Journal reported. Thirty-four more people have died from Covid-19 in Ireland, taking the country’s total death toll 1,265, reports the Irish Department of Health. There is now a total of 20,833 confirmed cases in the country after 221 more were detected since Thursday. Donald Trump threatening to reignite the US-China trade war in reaction to coronavirus has triggered a sell-off in global financial markets, as the economic costs of the pandemic continue to mount, Richard Partington, the Guardian’s economics correspondent, reports. Against a backdrop of rising tension between the world’s two biggest economic superpowers, share prices resumed a downward slide on Friday with the FTSE 100 falling by 144 points, or 2.5%, in London. Selling pressure resumed on Wall Street after recording gradual gains in recent weeks amid rising hopes a turning point had been reached for the coronavirus crisis. As fears over the economic costs from the disease mount and as the White House ramped up the threat of a renewed trade conflict with Beijing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 2% in afternoon trading in New York. Stock prices fell sharply in Japan, with the Nikkei index of leading Japanese company shares sliding by more than 500 points, or 2.8%. Markets in China, Hong Kong and South Korea were closed for public holidays. Despite world leaders starting to outline plans to lift lockdown measures more than a month on from the depths of the crisis, the economic fallout from tight controls on social and business activity during the Covid-19 outbreak are now becoming increasingly clear A US federal judge ordered authorities to release of people from three migrant detention centres in Florida to prevent a wider spread of the coronavirus and protect detainees with underlying conditions, the Associated Press reports. District court judge Marcia Cooke issued an order late on Thursday for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to begin the steps to bring down the number of detainees from 1,400 to about 350 within two weeks. Two others orders were also issued on Thursday by federal judges in California and Louisiana siding with groups seeking the release of immigrants at high risk. In Miami, seven detainees at the Krome detention centre have tested positive for Covid-19. According to court filings at least eight members of staff have also been infected there. The judge said she found violations of the Fifth and Eight Amendments that protect due process and against unusual punishment, as conditions are worsening each day at Krome and authorities have failed at practicing social distancing at one of the other facilities. These failures have placed petitioners at a heightened risk of not only contracting COVID-19, but also succumbing to the fatal effects of the virus as some of the petitioners have serious underlying medical illness, Cook wrote in the document. Such failures amount to cruel and unusual punishment because they are exemplary of deliberate indifference. ICE was ordered to submit a report on Sunday with the steps to release detainees. Here are the latest headlines in our global coronavirus news coverage: The global number of infections passed 3.2m, while at least 233,000 have died, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University’s tally of official figures. The UK death toll rose to at least 27,510 after officials reported 739 more deaths. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said 177,454 people have tested positive; an increase of 6,201 since Thursday’s update. Of those, 15,111 are in hospital. The US military has developed as potential breakthrough test that could identify carriers before they become infectious. Researchers hope the blood test will detect the virus about four days before current tests can. Israel is to partially reopen schools on Sunday, with a full return for all students by 1 June. First, second and third graders as well as 11th and 12th graders can return to school from Sunday, the first day of the week in Israel. US activists plan biggest rent strike in decades, calling for state leaders to cancel rent during the pandemic. Activists in New York, Pennsylvania and California are encouraging tenants to withhold rent, even if they can pay. India extended its lockdown – the world’s biggest by population – for two more weeks, but with some easing of restrictions in areas with few cases. South Africa began to ease its lockdown, with some industries allowed to reopen after five weeks. Africa’s most industrialised nation was already struggling with low growth and high debts when the lockdown began on 27 March. The US handed $50m Covid-19 aid to fossil fuel firms, money that they are unlikely to have to pay back, according to a review of coronavirus aid meant for small businesses by investigative research group Documented and the Guardian. Japan is preparing for a month-long extension to its state of emergency, its prime minister, Shinzo Abe, says. He imposed an initial month-long emergency for seven regions on 7 April, before expanding it across the whole country. Six more people have died from coronavirus in Serbia, while 196 new infections were recorded, according to a report on local news site Telegraf. The latest update brings the total death toll in the Balkan country to 185, with the overall number of confirmed cases now at 9,205. Serbia has so far counted 113 male victims of the virus, and 72 female. Sixty-five patients are currently on respirators in the country. Egypt has reported 14 more deaths from Covid-19, bringing the country’s total toll to 406. According to the health ministry’s daily report, published on Facebook, 358 more confirmed cases of coronavirus were detected. So far 5,895 infections have been confirmed in Egypt, making it Africa’s second-worst affected country. Deaths from the Covid-19 epidemic in Italy climbed by 269 on Friday, down from 285 the day before, the Civil Protection Agency said, while the daily tally of new infections stood at 1,965 against 1,872 on Thursday, Reuters reports. The total death toll since the outbreak came to light on 21 February now stands at 28,236, the agency said - giving it the second highest death toll from the virus in the world after that of the US. The number of officially confirmed cases, which includes those who have died or recovered, was 207,428, the third highest global tally behind those of the US and Spain. People registered as currently carrying the illness declined to 100,943 from 101,551 on Thursday. There were 1,578 people in intensive care on Friday against a previous 1,694, maintaining a long-running decline. Of those originally infected, 78,249 were declared recovered against 75,945 a day earlier. The agency said 1.399 million people had been tested for the virus against 1.355 million the day before, out of a population of around 60 million. Scientists in Germany have said children with the coronavirus may be as infectious as adults, and urged caution as schools and playgrounds across Europe start to reopen, Kate Connolly in Berlin and Kim Willsher in Paris report. Researchers who analysed data on infected people found that the viral loads in children differed little from those in adults. Opening schools on the assumption that children are less likely to spread the virus was therefore ill-advised, said Christian Drosten, a virologist and Germany’s leading coronavirus expert, who led the team. “In the current situation, we must warn against the unlimited reopening of schools and kindergartens,” he added. Drosten’s study, which was released this week, examined the viral loads in the throats of 3,721 people, including more than 100 children, who tested positive for coronavirus in Berlin between January and April He said he had been able to carry out his analysis once the number of tests carried out by Labor Berlin, the largest laboratory of its kind in Europe, had reached the critical mass of 60,000 earlier this week. That gave him and his team, including Terry Jones, a mathematician from the Centre for Pathogen Evolution at the University of Cambridge, enough data to be able to carry out an analysis of children who have had the virus. The number of people who have died from Covid-19 in Turkey has risen by 84 in the last 24 hours to 3,258, with 2,188 new cases of the virus, Health Ministry data showed on Friday, according to Reuters. The total number of cases rose to 122,392, the data showed, the highest total outside Western Europe or the US. A total of 53,808 people have so far recovered. The number of tests conducted in the past 24 hours stood at 41,431, raising the total number of tests during the outbreak to 1.075 million. The UK has reported 739 more deaths from Covid-19, bringing the total death toll in the country to 27,510. In a daily briefing on the outbreak, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said 177,454 people have so far tested positive for coronavirus, an increase of 6,201 since yesterday. Of those, 15,111 patients are currently in hospital, Hancock said. You can see more more updates from the daily briefing on our UK blog. South Africa began to ease its strict coronavirus lockdown on Friday, allowing some industries to reopen after five weeks of restrictions, AFP reports. Africa’s most industrialised nation was already teetering with low growth and high debts when the lockdown kicked in on 27 March. Its easing comes after the ratings agency S&amp;P on Wednesday downgraded the country’s credit rating further to junk. President Cyril Ramaphosa said in a televised May Day speech: The poor and the working class are having to bear the burden of a global pandemic that has caused severe economic and social disruption … As we begin the process of easing the lockdown and many people start returning to work, we must remain vigilant and careful … The road ahead will be long and hard, and we will make mistakes. With 5,647 confirmed cases and 103 fatalities, South Africa has the continent’s highest Covid-19 death toll. But a mid-April government survey published on Friday showed that respondents were more concerned about a potential economic collapse than contracting coronavirus. People living in the poorest parts of the UK are dying from Covid-19 at double the rate of people in the richest areas, a data analysis has found, writes Caelainn Barr, the Guardian’s data projects editor. The most deprived areas had 55.1 deaths per 100,000 people – more than double that of people in the least deprived areas, where the death rate was 25.3, according to figures from England and Wales published by the Office for National Statistics on Friday. The findings have lead to calls for the government to support the most vulnerable and prompted questions about why poorer people appear to be dying in greater numbers than the wealthy. Javed Khan, the chief executive of Barnardo’s, said the crisis highlighted “deep-rooted inequalities that have been papered over for decades”. He went on: Vulnerable children and families – and those already experiencing disadvantage – risk becoming the forgotten victims. Without intervention this crisis will be devastating for a whole generation – their mental health, safety, education and job prospects are on the line. The government must ensure that the emergency funding and resources already announced reaches those in need without delay. And in the months ahead funding decisions should reflect the scale of the challenge now facing vulnerable children and families. India is to extend its coronavirus lockdown - the world’s biggest by population - but with some easing of restrictions in areas with few cases, according to AFP. The home ministry said in a statement that in view of “significant gains in the COVID-19 situation”, areas with few or no cases would see “considerable relaxations”. The lockdown imposed near the end of March has caused misery for millions of workers in India’s vast informal sector and dealt a major blow to Asia’s third-biggest economy. Air travel and passenger trains ground to a halt because of the lockdown and only the transport of “essential goods” was allowed, causing major problems as well as considerable confusion for industry and agriculture. However the stringent restrictions have been credited with keeping confirmed cases of coronavirus to about 35,000 cases as of Friday, with 1,152 deaths. The government said Friday that many activities will remain prohibited nationwide including air and rail travel - except for “select purposes” - schools, restaurants and large gatherings such as places of worship. Restrictions are being lifted largely according to what colour an area has been assigned in a government rating system. India is split into red zones with “significant risk of spread of the infection”; green zones with zero cases or no confirmed cases in the past 21 days; and those in between as orange. An outbreak of Covid-19 among workers in a meat factory in Tipperary has raised fears that the virus is spreading through abattoirs and meat-processing plants in Ireland, writes Ella McSweeney, for the Guardian’s Animals Farmed project. Sinn Féin’s spokesperson on agriculture, Brian Stanley, told the Irish parliament last night that 120 workers at the Rosderra Meats plant in Roscrea had tested positive for the virus. He also said that of 350 workers at the plant, up to 140 were off sick last week. Rosderra is the largest pork-processing company in Ireland. Michael Creed, Ireland’s agriculture minister, told MPs that he was aware of six meat-processing plants with two or more confirmed cases of Covid-19 among workers, although he did not name them. A spokesperson for Rosderra Meats confirmed to the Guardian that a number of employees had tested positive for coronavirus. They said that the company had implemented stringent measures to ensure the safety of employees, and added that production will be scaled down until all staff return to work. The World Health Organization’s daily coronavirus briefing is starting now. Today, the UN health agency is expected to announce a joint effort with the European Investment bank to support countries in addressing the health impact of Covid-19. The partnership between WHO and the world’s largest international public bank is meant to boost cooperation to strengthen public health, supply of essential equipment, training and hygiene investment in countries most vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO said in a release on Friday. It will will benefit from the EIB’s planned €1.4bn response to address the health, social and economic impact of COVID-19 in Africa. Efforts will include: scaling up investment to tackle antimicrobial resistance; improving the effectiveness of malaria treatment; scaling up investment to tackle antimicrobial resistance Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director general, said: Combining the public health experience of the World Health Organization and the financial expertise of the European Investment Bank will contribute to a more effective response to COVID-19 and other pressing health challenges. WHO looks forward to strengthening cooperation with the EIB to improve access to essential supplies including medical equipment and training, and deliver better water, sanitation and hygiene where most needed. New initiatives to improve primary health care in Africa and support the EU Malaria Fund hint at the potential impact of our new partnership As of 30 April, Vietnam has a coronavirus death count of zero and only 270 cases. Trang Bui, a Vietnamese freelance journalist based in Ho Chi Minh City, has written for the Guardian’s Comment section about how the south east Asian nation achieved it. Out of the key factors that contributed to Vietnam’s successful coronavirus response, timeliness was the first. Vietnam acted early and did not hesitate to alert its citizens. On 28 January, when the country recorded only two cases, the government announced that it was planning for a scenario in which thousands of people could contract the virus. Rwanda is to ease its coronavirus lockdown from Monday, allowing limited movement of people and restricted re-openings of restaurants and hotels, according to Reuters. Movement between provinces in the central African country will still not be allowed, while schools will also remain shut until September, according to a government statement released late on Thursday. All resumed services must adhere to health guidelines ... mask wearing and social distancing. Rwanda alongside neighbouring Uganda implemented some of the strictest lockdown measures in Africa to help slow the spread of the coronavirus, including shuttering all but the most essential businesses. As of Thursday it had 243 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and no deaths. Scientists working for the US military have designed a new Covid-19 test that could potentially identify carriers before they become infectious and spread the disease, Giles Tremlett reports for the Guardian. In what could be a significant breakthrough, project coordinators hope the blood-based test will be able to detect the virus’s presence as early as 24 hours after infection – before people show symptoms and several days before a carrier is considered capable of spreading it to other people. That is also around four days before current tests can detect the virus. The test has emerged from a project set up by the US military’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) aimed at rapid diagnosis of germ or chemical warfare poisoning. It was hurriedly repurposed when the pandemic broke out and the new test is expected to be put forward for emergency use approval (EUA) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within a week. “The concept fills a diagnostic gap worldwide,” the head of Darpa’s biological technologies office, Dr Brad Ringeisen, told the Guardian, since it should also fill in testing gaps at later stages of the infection. If given FDA approval, he said, it had the potential to be “absolutely a gamechanger”. Comoros has reported its first case of coronavirus, the World Health Organization’s Africa office said. Its daily round up of Covid-19 figures from Africa showed that South Africa and Egypt still have the most confirmed cases, while Algeria has recorded the most deaths. Riot police fanned out across Hong Kong on Friday after democracy activists threatened to defy a ban on gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic - but the streets remained largely calm, AFP reports. Activists in the semi-autonomous financial hub, which had for months protested against a strengthening of control by China’s government, had issued calls to muster once more on May Day - despite emergency anti-virus laws banning more than four people gathering in public. The threat largely failed to materialise, although hundreds of protesters did however gather in small groups at a shopping mall in the town of Shatin, chanting slogans and holding protest flags. Riot police soon rushed into the mall and used pepper spray to disperse the crowd. One protester, a retired firefighter who gave his name as Lam, said: I feel that the movement has been watered down because of the pandemic, but I personally think we should keep fighting. If we shrink back and accept our fate, then we will be living under an authoritarian regime. A day after armed protesters against Michigan’s stay-at-home order entered the statehouse in Lansing, Donald Trump has once again expressed support for the rightwing movement, writes Joan E Greve, a Guardian US politics reporter. Michigan’s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, should, the president wrote in a tweet on Friday morning, “make a deal” with the demonstrators. Some of the demonstrators in Lansing on Thursday carried assault rifles, causing alarm among legislators. Some protesters, many without face coverings, entered the statehouse and demanded to be let on to the House floor, which is not allowed. The gallery was closed to the public to allow room for representatives and reporters to spread apart. Cities around the world are taking the lead in post-coronavirus planning, with a raft of environmental initiatives being rolled out in places from Bogotá to Barcelona to ensure public safety and bolster the fight against climate breakdown, Guardian environment correspondents Matthew Taylor and Sandra Laville report. Mayors from cities in Europe, the US and Africa held talks this week to coordinate their efforts to support a low-carbon, sustainable recovery from the crisis as national governments begin to roll out huge economic stimulus packages. Many cities have already announced measures, from hundreds of miles of new bike lanes in Milan and Mexico City to widening pavements and pedestrianising neighbourhoods in New York and Seattle. The initiatives are designed to allow people to move around urban spaces safely in a world where physical distancing will be the norm for the foreseeable future – and do so without sparking a drastic increase in air pollution. The mayors who took part in the newly formed economic taskforce this week believe these initial schemes point the way to more radical long-term measures that will help tackle inequality and the climate crisis. The mayor of Milan, who is heading the taskforce run by the C40 group of cities, said: Our immediate priority is to protect the health of our residents and overcome the Covid-19 pandemic. However, we must also look towards how we will keep our people safe in the future. How we structure our recovery efforts will define our cities for decades to come. Is expecting the worst the best way to handle the coronavirus crisis? During the pandemic, it’s useful to see the role your coping mechanisms play, if only to stop yourself spiralling into anxiety, writes Oliver Burkemann, a Guardian writer based in New York, in his regular column on mental wellbeing. Exactly how terrible are the next months and years going to be? As a generally apocalyptically minded sort of person, I’ve been feeling some pride in watching my favourite question become everyone else’s favourite question, too; it’s like being a 19th-century aristocrat and seeing your debutante daughter become the star of the London season. But in deciding who to listen to, and thus how alarmed to be, it’s easy to overlook a crucial factor: in a crisis as all-consuming as this one, nobody – not academic experts, not media commentators, not that one friend who keeps urging you to be less (or more) worried than you are – is a completely neutral observer. Because predictions about the future aren’t solely about the future. They’re also coping mechanisms for dealing with the present.

Boris Johnson is of course no newcomer to Greece, a country he visited regularly in pre-corona times to sojourn at his father’s villa in Pelion, the peninsula off the mainland overlooking the Aegean Sea. Greek diplomats and politicians voice admiration for his knowledge of the classics. But Britain’s handling of the disease – its soft-touch approach and consequential catastrophic death toll - has been met with disbelief in a nation that, despite the odds has kept Covid-19 under remarkable control. In contrast to the 26,771 people who have succumbed to the pandemic in the UK which has registered 165,221 coronavirus cases so far, Greece has recorded 2,591 infections and a death toll of 140 after enforcing tough measures to curb the spread of the disease early on. Addressing reporters at his daily briefing on Thursday, the Greek health ministry spokesman and infectious disease expert professor Sotiris Tsiodras spoke of “victory” saying incidents of the illness had clearly stabilised. The UK is home to a large Greek community many of whom fled to Greece before commercial air traffic was suspended in March. Indicative of the mood the popular Protothema newspaper reported the news of the birth of the prime minister’s latest child under the headline: “Johnson, father amid national sorrow over coronavirus.” “In the midst of the national sorrow that has weighed down on British society, the birth of Boris Johnson’s son has once again brought his personal life, one that is as unconventional as he is, back in the public eye,” the paper wrote. “[A life] with two marriages, an engagement, three extra marital affairs and at least six children.” Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, continued to fly in the face of science on Thursday when he called social isolation measures introduced by state governors and mayors “useless”. He said: We know that many people will die. I’m sorry. Seventy percent of the population will be infected and, from what it seems, from what we are seeing now, up until now all this effort to flatten the curve was practically useless. What’s the consequence, the collateral effect of this? Unemployment. The people want to go back to work. The president has consistently sought to downplay the impacts of the pandemic, arguing that Brazilians would be immune because they jump in sewage, and mixing with supporters. Brazil has 85,380 confirmed cases and 5,901 deaths with 435 reported in the last 24 hours as numbers accelerate. His new health minister, Nelson Teich, earlier contradicted this view. “You can’t start freeing things up when you have a curve that is frankly ascending,” he said. While there are no definitive studies about the impact of social isolation on the growth of Brazil’s cases, experts believe it has had a positive impact. The worst-hit state of São Paulo, for instance, was supposed to see a peak in April but this has now been moved to May, the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper reported. “Brazil had flattened the curve, yes, with isolation measures, but in the last two weeks we are seeing a loosening of isolation and what we are seeing is a new acceleration of the epidemic,” Fernando Bozza,a researcher in infectious diseases at the government research institute Fiocruz in Rio de Janeiro who is modelling the pandemic, told the Guardian. Malaysia on Friday detained hundreds of refugees and migrant workers for illegally living in the country, rights groups said, at a time of movement and travel restrictions imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19. Malaysia has around two million registered foreign workers but authorities estimate many more are living in the Southeast Asian country without proper documents. Malaysia does not formally recognise refugees, regarding them as illegal migrants. The arrests followed immigration raids in a neighbourhood in capital Kuala Lumpur where thousands of migrant workers and refugees live, according to human rights groups and photos shared on social media. Human Rights Watch and the Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network said over 700 migrants were taken into custody including young children. Malaysian police and the immigration department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Rachel Tan, programme officer at the Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network, said the arrests were a “criminalisation of a people who toil in difficult and dangerous work conditions”. The neighbourhood where the raids took place was close to an area with three buildings that had been placed under strict lockdowns last month after a surge in coronavirus cases there. Malaysia has reported a total of 6,071 coronavirus cases and 103 deaths, and its prime minister said on Friday that most businesses will reopen from Monday following six-week long curbs that have caused a damaging economic slowdown. Big Macs delivered on meal trolleys, hand washing stations at the entrance and designated waiting spots to separate customers could become a feature of McDonald’s restaurants in the Netherlands when they are allowed to reopen. In a trial at a restaurant in the city of Arnhem, McDonald’s has been looking for ways to maintain social distancing when the coronavirus lockdown is relaxed. McDonald’s Netherlands spokeswoman Eunice Koekkoek told Reuters: We have tried to figure out how to keep our customers and employees safe, while maintaining a restaurant atmosphere. These are drastic changes, but we hope to make them in a way that customers don’t notice them too much. Restaurants, bars and other public places in the Netherlands have been closed since 15 March. But new infections have been dropping, prompting calls to loosen the lockdown after its current deadline of 19 May. A decision on whether to reopen restaurants and bars is expected around 12 May, but the prime minister, Mark Rutte, has ruled out a return to normal. If they do reopen, they will have to keep customers and staff at least 1.5 meters (5 feet) apart to avoid a new wave of infections. McDonald’s says it could introduce table service, with burgers and fries wheeled to customers on trolleys from which they can pick up their orders. Other new features would include hand-washing stations at the entrance and a host behind a plastic screen showing customers their place in line. Many restaurant owners in the Netherlands fear social distancing will simply put them out of business. But McDonald’s expects its new set-up will work at 180 larger restaurants out of its 252 franchises in the country. Koekkoek said: On average this will allow us to serve around 66% of our normal number of customers. We don’t expect reopening to be allowed before June. But even then, we will move in steps. Readjusting 180 restaurants is a tall order. The Hungarian budget carrier, Wizz Air, flew into London’s Luton airport from Sofia on Friday, becoming one of the first European airlines to restart routes during the coronavirus pandemic. At least one person onboard seen through the window was wearing a face mask. There were also dozens of passengers within the airport, spaced out for social distancing, possibly for the return flight which took off shortly afterwards. European airlines have grounded the majority of their fleets over the last six weeks as governments imposed travel restrictions to combat the spread of the virus. But Wizz Air said last week it planned to put some of its planes back in the air for essential travel, restoring services to destinations in Romania, Budapest in Hungary, Lisbon in Portugal and Spain’s Tenerife plus a few more. The London Luton arrivals and departures board showed three Wizz Air flights were due to arrive and depart on Friday. The airline says it is important to get the infrastructure operating and that there are people across Europe who need to travel for work. Across Europe, air traffic is down by about 90% according to global body IATA, with the flights that are still operating facilitating the repatriation of citizens, travel by medical experts and cargo supplies. Given ongoing travel restrictions - UK government advice for example is for Britons to avoid all non-essential global travel and Wizz has said that it does not expect flights to be full, enabling it to maintain social distancing onboard. The airline, whose geographic focus is on central and eastern Europe, has said all passengers must wear masks on flights while its crew will wear masks and gloves. When travel restrictions do start to ease, it is likely that there will be tougher measures for flying, which could affect demand. Britain is considering a two-week quarantine requirement for arrivals into the country. India is extending its nationwide lockdown for another two weeks after 4 May, but will allow “considerable relaxations”. These will apply in lower-risk districts marked as green and orange zones, under the government’s plan to fight the Covid-19. Ural Airlines has begun delivering in-flight meals to travel-deprived Russians who miss the thrill of a catering cart rolling down the aisle because of coronavirus lockdown. The airline, which is delivering its in-flight meals to customers in Moscow, St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg, said the initiative was meant to provide people with “the taste of travel without leaving your home”. “Everything is just like on the airplane except for the view,” it wrote on its Instagram page on Thursday. Russia has closed its borders to foreigners and grounded international flights, except those repatriating Russians or returning foreign nationals to their country of origin. Ural Airlines’ service offers the staples of airline meals - chicken, meat and fish - as well as orange, apple and tomato juice. The meal is served on a traditional airline tray. US fossil fuel companies have taken at least $50m in taxpayer money they likely won’t have to pay back, according to a review of coronavirus aid meant for struggling small businesses by the investigative research group Documented and the Guardian, writes Guardian US environment reporter Emily Holden in Washington. A total of $28m is going to three coal mining companies, including two with ties to Trump officials, bolstering a dying American industry and a fuel that scientists insist world leaders must shift away from to avoid the worst of the climate crisis. The other $22m is being paid out to oil and gas services and equipment providers and other firms that work with drillers and coal miners. Melinda Pierce, the legislative director for the Sierra Club, said: The federal money Congress appropriated should be going to help small businesses and frontline workers struggling as a result of the pandemic, not the corporate polluters whose struggles are a result of failing business practices and existed long before Covid-19 entered the public lexicon. This fascinating thread is an account of how a remote fishing village in Iceland dealt with its coronavirus outbreak. It is worth clicking through to read in full. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the Netherlands has risen by 475 to 39,791 health authorities said on Friday, with 98 new deaths. The country’s death toll stands at 4,893, the Dutch institute for public health and the environment (RIVM) said in its daily update. The RIVM cautioned it only reports confirmed cases, and actual numbers are higher. But it said the latest figures are “in line with the impression that the measures [taken to deal with the outbreak] are working,” adding: The number of new hospital admissions reported per day is still decreasing. The same applies to the number of reported deaths. The country is on course to reopen primary schools on 11 May, with secondary schools planned to reopen the following month. The world’s largest public service union federation, Public Services International, has launched a 12-hour virtual May Day live stream to celebrate the public service workers who are keeping society going during the coronavirus pandemic. With more than 600 affiliated unions, PSI represents more than 20 million workers in 180 countries. They are calling on unions and workers across the world to take action from their homes rather than in the streets. In a blog posted to their website today, PSI general secretary, Rosa Pavanelli, said: This May Day, for the first time in a century, workers won’t be in the streets. They’re busy saving the world. They’re keeping our relatives on life support. They’re keeping food systems flowing. They are risking their lives to save lives - not as heroes, but as professionals. As Trade Unions, the only way we can do justice to these momentous efforts is by winning the deep, systemic change which workers, now more than ever, need and deserve. Anyone who wants to take part is encouraged to post a solidarity message to frontline workers to social media, using the hashtag #VirtualMayDay, or chat join the live chat on the stream on Vimeo or Facebook. By eschewing the kinds of lockdowns seen elsewhere in the world, Sweden has taken a different and controversial approach to tackling the coronavirus pandemic. That has led to international criticism and wounded national pride, writes Gina Gustavsson, an academic at Uppsala University. She asks: has Sweden’s coronavirus strategy played into the hands of nationalists? Sweden has persisted with the strategy of coronavirus mitigation that the UK government eventually abandoned in March. The policy is widely supported by the public, even though the Swedish Covid-19 mortality rate is among the 10 highest in the world, at 240 per million population and steadily rising, and many of the nursing homes in Stockholm are now affected. The typical explanation for this continued public support is that Swedes are trusting and unflappable. The country’s chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, the public face of the Swedish response to the pandemic, is after all a dry scientist-turned-bureaucrat, not some populist politician trying to whip up nationalist go-it-alone emotion. But beneath the surface, Sweden is anything but calm. The public debate is inflamed with a sense of wounded national pride. As a believer in the kind of liberal nationalism that encourages self-critical national attachment, this pains me. But as a scholar of nationalism, I recognise the pattern. This is what Isaiah Berlin called the nationalism of “the bent twig”, which lashes out against anyone who steps on it. Thousands of Indian students unable to leave the UK because of the coronavirus lockdown are relying on food donations from charities because they can no longer afford to eat, Anna Fazackerly reports for the Guardian. Student groups representing the students, from across Britain, have been coordinating emergency food drops with local community groups and charities. Many of the young people have lost their part-time jobs and can no longer afford even basic living costs. The Indian National Students’ Association, one of the largest student groups, says so far it has helped to distribute food to more than 3,000 struggling students across the country. A second UK-wide students’ group, the National Indian Students and Alumni Union, says it has also had calls from hundreds of students who cannot afford food. Charan Sekhon, the chair of an Anglo-Indian charity based in Bedford called the Seva Trust, which has delivered food parcels to more than 60 Indian students in its local area, says: “We have had lots of examples where students are actually starving. They haven’t got anything at all to eat.” India banned all international flights from 22 March, giving students only two days to arrange to get home. Flights that typically cost around £300 were selling for £2,000, and thousands of students found themselves stranded in Britain. Singapore has begun moving migrant workers who have recovered from coronavirus infections to two cruise ships in an effort to curb its spread in workers’ dormitories, AFP reports. After taking swift and aggressive measures that initially controlled its outbreak, Singapore has been hit by a bigger second wave among the work permit holders who carry out many of the basic services that keep the city running. On Friday, Singapore’s ministry of health reported 932 new infections, the majority of which were among migrant workers, who are housed in sprawling dormitory complexes. Just five cases were found among Singapore nationals or so-called permanent residents. So far it has reported 17,101 cases but just 15 deaths. A group of migrant workers boarded the SuperStar Gemini, a mid-sized cruise ship, on Wednesday, and another vessel, the SuperStar Aquarius, is ready to receive more after undergoing assessments by government agencies, the Singapore Tourism Board said on Friday. Together, the vessels can accommodate up to 2,000. Fifteen people have been arrested in Istanbul, Turkey, for trying to stage a May Day march in defiance of coronavirus lockdown measures, according to the Associated Press. The Confederation of Progressive Trade Unions of Turkey, or DISK, tweeted that its head Arzu Cerkezoglu and several other union leaders were detained near Taksim Square, where they wanted to lay wreaths of carnations. The Istanbul governor’s office said the demonstrators were later released. The statement added that various trade unions had left wreaths in Taksim Square, as permitted by the governor’s office, but that DISK had insisted on collectively marching to the square, which was in breach of lockdown and social distancing rules. Taksim Square holds a symbolic value for Turkeys labour movement. In 1977, 34 people were killed there during a May Day event when shots were fired into the crowd from a nearby building. Turkey has imposed partial lockdowns in 31 provinces every weekend and on national holidays. Exemptions apply, including for many labourers who continue to work amid the pandemic. The ban on May Day demonstrations in Taksim has been in effect for several years, due to security concerns. Police closed all roads leading to Taksim Square with barricades and increased security presence Friday. Turkey ranks seventh in the world for the number of confirmed infections with 120,204 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University, although experts believe the actual toll of the pandemic is higher than the tally. The country’s official death toll stands at 3,174. Here are the latest headlines in our international coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. China’s Hubei province will lower its coronavirus emergency response from the highest to the second-highest level. The announcement follows months of strict lockdown. The virus was first detected in the province’s capital, Wuhan, in late 2019. Deprived areas of England and Wales have double the death rates of affluent areas. Of the 20,283 Covid-19 registered deaths in England and Wales to 17 April, an overwhelming proportion of fatalities were of people from the poorest areas, figures from the Office for National Statistics revealed. Russia reported 7,933 new cases of Covid-19 in a record daily rise, bringing the nationwide tally to 114,431. The official nationwide death toll rose to 1,169 after 96 people with the virus died in the last 24 hours, Russia’s coronavirus crisis response centre said. Ryanair is to cut 3,000 jobs reduce staff pay by up to a fifth in response to the Covid-19 crisis, which has grounded flights. The no-frills airline said it did not expect passenger numbers or pricing to return to pre-coronavirus levels until summer 2022 at the earliest. Queensland, Australia, cleared way for the National Rugby League season to restart. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has opened the state border in preparation for restart of the National Rugby League (NRL) season on 28 May. One million people have recovered from coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Infections worldwide stand at 3,269,667. More than 233,700 people have died in the pandemic so far. Trump claimed he has seen evidence that Covid-19 originated in Wuhan lab. When the president was asked if he has seen anything that gives you a “high degree of confidence” that coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Donald Trump replied: “Yes, I have.” His own government experts say the virus was “not manmade or genetically modified”. Israel’s government just announced the country will partially reopen schools on Sunday, with a full return to for all students by 1 June, reports Oliver Holmes, the Guardian’s Jerusalem correspondent. First, second and third graders as well as 11th and 12th graders can return to school as of Sunday, the first day of the week in Israel. Childcare and kindergartens, ages zero to six, will remain closed for at least another week, the government said. Despite seeing a drop in the number of daily virus infections during the past few days, the reopening of schools has been a contentious issue in Israel, with fierce debate within the government around whether it was a premature step. Following Friday’s announcement, the mayor of Tel Aviv said he would not allow schools to open there. Ron Huldai was quoted by Haaretz newspaper as saying the plan “doesn’t ensure the wellbeing and health of the children”. A partial reopening has also been criticised by parents of children of different ages who will still not be able to work. The country has 15,946 total confirmed cases and 223 deaths. A report by Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) yesterday heighten concerns among US officials and lawmakers that the pandemic threatens to derail stalled US-led peace efforts, Akhtar Mohammad Makoii reports. The spread of COVID-19 already has significantly impacted Afghanistan, the report said, from complicating the peace initiative to forcing border crossing closures that have disrupted commercial and humanitarian deliveries. “Afghanistan’s numerous and, in some cases, unique vulnerabilities - a weak health-care system, widespread malnutrition, porous borders, massive internal displacement, contiguity with Iran, and ongoing conflict - make it likely the country will confront a health disaster in the coming months,” the report said. Meanwhile Save the Children announced yesterday that around seven million children are at risk of hunger due to the lockdowns following spread Coronavirus in Afghanistan. “At a time when Afghan children need adequate daily nutrition to help strengthen their immune systems to fight the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the price of basic foods is rising under the lockdown, making it harder for families to feed themselves,” the report said. The organization also warned that a third of the country will face food shortages. “A third of the population – including 7.3 million children – will face food shortages in April and May due to the current pandemic,” the organisation said. According to the organisation, even before the global COVID-19 crisis, the total number of children who needed some form of humanitarian support this year stood at 5.26 million, making war-torn Afghanistan one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a child. In case you needed it, here is a video explaining why the 5G coronavirus conspiracy theory is false. France’s education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, is today expected to announce strict rules for the reopening of crêches, nursery and primary schools later this month, writes Kim Willsher, the Guardian’s Paris correspondent. A provisional document seen by Le Monde and AFP suggests rules will be strict in applying accepted barrier and social distancing regulations, but it has already been declared unworkable by teachers, especially for classes of younger children. Teachers are expected to return on 11 May to prepare for the restarting of classes the following day. The draft health protocol says children must wash their hands on arrival at school, before and after visiting lavatories, before and after each meal, after playtime, after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing and touching shared objects and before going home. Taps and running water are to be preferred but sanitising gel must be provided if this is not possible. Ball games and contact games are banned and there is to be no exchange of personal objects. If more than one child touches an object it should be disinfected. There must be staggered recreation and play breaks, and limited changes of room – French children tend to take different subjects in different classes – as well a one-way system organised in school buildings so pupils can maintain a 1-metre minimum distance from each other. Classes to be regularly disinfected and aired and doors left open to avoid pupils touching handles. The wearing of masks is not obligatory for nursery school children, but is advised, and staff must wear masks. There will also be a limit to the number of children in each class –reportedly 10 children for those in crêches and nurseries, and 15 in primary schools. It must be stressed these are details in the provisional protocol, which needs to be confirmed by the education minister today. The two lowest years in secondary schools will start back the following week, on 18 May. A decision on other years will be made at the end of May for a possible return to class on 2 June. Another unknown factor is what say local mayors will have in deciding whether schools in their areas should reopen or if restarting classes poses too much of a risk, particularly in areas designated “red”, where the virus is circulating. Japan is preparing for a month-long extension to its coronavirus state of emergency, prime minister Shinzo Abe said on Friday. Abe imposed an initial month-long emergency for seven regions on 7 April, before subsequently expanding it across the whole country. With measures due to expire next week, Abe said he had told his minister responsible for handling the outbreak, Yasutoshi Nishimura, to plan for an extension, AFP reports. He was quoted as saying: After receiving [a] report from the panel of experts, I asked Minister Nishimura to use extending the current framework of the state of emergency by about one month as the base scenario for swiftly drafting plans that will fit the needs of the regions An extension of the state of emergency had been widely expected, despite the comparatively small scale of the outbreak in Japan, with nearly 14,300 infections recorded and 432 deaths so far. Thousands of people in the US plan to take part in a rent strike on Friday, calling for state leaders to cancel rent during the coronavirus crisis, writes Guardian US reporter Adam Gabbatt. Activists in New York, Pennsylvania and California are encouraging tenants to withhold rent, whether they are able to pay or not, to draw attention to the plight of those unable to pay. The protest is expected to represent the largest coordinated rent strike in America in decades, and comes as the labor department announced another 3.8 million people lost their jobs last week, with pressure growing on state leaders nationwide to increase their efforts on housing. More than 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits in the past six weeks, as the coronavirus has caused widespread business closures. The New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is among those voicing support for the strikes, which are being coordinated by an array of housing groups. “People aren’t striking because they don’t feel like paying rent, they’re striking because they can’t,” Ocasio-Cortez said. Sixty-three more people have died from Covid-19 in Iran, bringing the total death toll in the country to 6,091, health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said in a statement on state TV on Friday, according to Reuters. The total number of diagnosed cases of the coronavirus in the Islamic Republic, one of the Middle Eastern countries hardest hit by the outbreak, has reached 95,646, including 2,899 in critical condition, he added. Hello and happy International Workers Day to readers around the world. This is Damien Gayle taking control of the global live blog now for the next eight hours, bringing you the latest international news on the coronavirus outbreak. If you have any tips, comments or suggestions for coverage please drop me a line via email to damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or in a direct message on Twitter to @damiengayle. Spain has recorded 281 coronavirus deaths over the past 24 hours, compared with 268 yesterday, as it prepares for the first phase of the lockdown exit strategy. The total number of deaths stands at 24,824. On Saturday, people of all ages will be allowed out for exercise for the first time in seven weeks, a week after children were allowed out to play if accompanied by an adult. To avoid overcrowding, separate time slots have been allocated for the elderly, people with the children and everyone else. Barcelona has opened half of its parks and closed 44 streets to traffic in order to facilitate social distancing. The Madrid region will monitor 2m mobile phones to observe how the relaxed lockdown is progressing. Today, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, the Madrid regional president, formally closed the vast field hospital at the capital’s IFEMA exhibition centre, which opened 41 days ago. The temporary hospital, which came to symbolise the nation’s fight against the virus, had 5,500 beds. Of the thousands of coronavirus patients admitted, 98% survived. In a provisional assessment of the economic impact of the health crisis, the government estimates Spain’s GDP will fall by 9.2% this year. Ministers said today the virus has so far cost the nation €139bn, of which around €17bn has gone on paying furloughed employees. After ending 2019 with a public deficit of 2.8%, this year it is expected to be 10.7%. In Afghanistan, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases continued to surge on Friday in Kandahar as nationwide number of infections reached 2,335, amid increasing number of health workers testing positive. A health ministry spokesman said 164 new Covid-19 cases were recorded in last 24 hours, most of which were new infections recorded in southern province of Kandahar as total number of confirmed cases reached 339 with 45 confirmed today in the province. Four patients died in the same period, taking the death toll to 68 in the war-torn country. There have so far been 310 recoveries, 50 of which have been in last 24 hours. Wahidullah Mayar, the health ministry spokesman, said 228 health workers have so far tested positive for Covid-19, most of them are confirmed in Kandahar with 38 cases. In Kabul, the country’s worst affected area, the health ministry reported 44 new Coronavirus cases, bringing the total number to 617. Mayar said spread of the virus in Afghanistan is “fast” and asked people to stay at home as the country is yet to reach its peak in number of deaths and infections. Despite the lockdown, in most of cities streets were still crowded with vehicles and people walking freely around. Hundreds of workers at Amazon warehouses, Whole Foods grocery stores, Target retail stores, and shoppers at Instacart and Shipt called out sick on Friday as part of a coordinated one-day strike across the US in protest of working conditions and inadequate safety protections during the coronavirus pandemic. The 1 May walkout began after Amazon ended its unlimited unpaid time off policy for workers at the end of April. “The fact they took it away prior to the sick-out lets you know they’re aware of the sick-out and trying to stop people from participating in that,” said Derrick Palmer, an Amazon employee at the JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island, New York, who has worked at Amazon for more than four years. “Now they’re forcing people to go to work because if you run out of unpaid time off, that’s it, you’re fired.” Palmer was one of the workers who participated in protests outside of JFK8 warehouse a few weeks ago in demand of safety protections for Amazon workers. An assistant manager at JFK8, Chris Smalls, was fired shortly after he organised the protest. Palmer said that after the protests, Amazon began providing personal protective equipment to workers and enforcing social distancing rules and temperature checks, but he said cleaning procedures remain inadequate. The Office for National Statistics has published analysis on Covid-19 deaths by local areas and deprivation in England and Wales. The London mortality rate was significantly higher than any other region. The analysis found a strong link between how deprived an area is and the coronavirus mortality rate. In England, the mortality rate of deaths involving Covid-19 in the most deprived areas was more than double that in the least deprived areas: Most deprived: 55.1 deaths per 100,000 population Least deprived: 25.3 deaths per 100,000 population The Guardian will be digging into this data set throughout the day, but you can read it yourself here. Armed protesters enter Michigan’s state capitol demanding an end to coronavirus lockdown. Hundreds of protesters, some armed, attempted to enter the legislative chamber of Michigan’s state capitol, in response to moves to extend Covid-19 lockdown orders. The demonstrators gathered as the Democrat governor, Gretchen Whitmer, pushed for stay-at-home orders to continue to mid-May. The state has recorded 3,789 coronavirus deaths. China Xinhua News reports that Central China’s Hubei province, where the coronavirus outbreak started, will lower its emergency response from the highest to the second-highest level starting on 2 May, following months of strict lockdown. Here’s more information on Australia’s road to recovery by Guardian reporter Paul Karp and Daniel Hurst. Scott Morrison has offered Australians an “early mark” to ease Covid-19 restrictions next week while warning a return to normality will depend on uptake of the Covidsafe contact tracing app. The prime minister dangled the prospect of a potential loosening of the rules next Friday as he issued his strongest declaration yet that it was conditional on more downloads. Morrison also revealed that net overseas migration is down 30% and is expected to fall by 80% in 2020-21, both compared with 2018-19, in a sign the economic contraction from Covid-19 will last much longer than restrictions to social life. Treasury officials and the Reserve Bank both estimate that unemployment is set to top 10%. The first restrictions were eased this week with New South Wales allowing visits to friends and relatives, and a similar measure announced on Friday in the Australian Capital Territory, the first Australian jurisdiction with no active cases. In Greece, protesters have begun gathering in central Athens for traditional May Day marches, AP reports, despite authorities’ pleas to unions to move their demonstrations to next week after lockdown measures begin easing. More than 100 people from the Communist party-affiliated PAME union gathered in Athens’ main Syntagma Square, outside parliament. Holding banners and red flags, and most wearing masks and gloves, the protesters stood roughly 2 metres (6.5ft) apart from each other as they waited for the march to begin. The Philippines on Friday reported 284 new coronavirus infections and 11 more deaths, Reuters reports, bringing its total number of cases to 8,772 and fatalities to 579. It also said 41 more individuals had recovered, bringing total recoveries to 1,084. France’s state-owned SNCF railways company estimates it will lose at least €3bn (£2.6bn) in revenue as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, Les Echos daily newspaper reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources. Reuters reports the group has been running only 7% of its high-speed trains and 20% of regional services since mid-March and will be allowed to resume only about 30% of its network from 11 May as France seeks to manage the post-lockdown period. Les Echos newspaper said strikes over government pension reforms that started in early December in France has already cost the company €1bn in lost revenue. The newspaper said the company lost €700m in March, €1.4bn in April and expects losses to reach €3bn before a nationwide lockdown begins to ease from 11 May. EPA has this shot of a family wearing protective face masks while visiting Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China, on 1 May. China is loosening up nationwide restrictions after months of lockdown over the coronavirus crisis. Labour Day in the country kicked off with a long weekend and an extended holiday, from 1-5 May, after the tourism industry has been hit during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Rwanda will partially lift its virus lockdown from next week and allow people to move freely during the day more than six weeks after being confined, the prime minister’s office said Friday, AFP reports. Rwanda was one of the first to impose strict lockdown measures in Africa, on 22 March, when it had only 19 cases, and to date has officially recorded 225 cases and zero deaths. From Monday 4 May, people will be allowed to move freely from 5am to 8pm, but will need permission to do so later in the evening, the prime minister’s office said in a statement. Businesses, manufacturing and construction operations will be allowed to resume with essential workers, while markets will be allowed to open with no more than 50%t of traders operating. Hotels and restaurants will be allowed to operate but must close by 7pm. While people will be allowed to exercise in open spaces, sports facilities will remain closed. No more than 30 people will be allowed to attend funerals, and schools, churches, gyms and bars will remain closed. The speaker of Pakistan’s national assembly said late on Thursday that he had tested positive for Covid-19, after hosting an iftar dinner to celebrate Ramadan, Reuters reports, and meeting prime minister Imran Khan and other high officials earlier in the week. It remains unclear if Khan will be tested after Faisal Edhi tested positive. Khan tested negative in April, after meeting with the head of Pakistan’s biggest charity organisation, who was subsequently confirmed to have caught the disease. The assembly, the lower house of parliament, is in recess, though opposition parties have been calling for it to convene to discuss the government’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak in the country, where the number of cases has risen to 16,817, including 385 deaths. Russia reported its biggest daily rise of confirmed coronavirus cases on Friday , with 7,933 new cases. The record daily rise brings the nationwide tally to 114,431, Reuters reports. The official nationwide death toll rose to 1,169 after 96 people with the virus died in the last 24 hours, Russia’s coronavirus crisis response centre said. AFP have put together a brilliant photo gallery of May Day workers confronting coronavirus around the world. It is a celebration of the cleaners, transport workers, shop assistants, tradespeople, health workers and more who continue to serve despite the difficulties and risks of the pandemic. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Germany increased by 1,639 to 160,758 on Friday, according to data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases. The daily update showed the death toll rose by 193 to 6,481. Mikhail Mishustin, the Russian prime minister, who was tasked by Vladimir Putin with leading the response to the country’s coronavirus outbreak, has been diagnosed with Covid-19 and will self-isolate. Mishustin, Russia’s most-high profile Covid-19 patient so far, disclosed the diagnosis during a televised video call with President Putin on Thursday evening. It was not immediately clear how severe Mishustin’s symptoms are, though one news agency reported that he had an elevated temperature of 39 degrees. Putin indicated during the call that Mishustin would be taken to hospital. Confirmed coronavirus cases in Russia passed 100,000 on Thursday. The first deputy prime minister, Andrei Belousov, would take on Mishustin’s duties in his absence, Putin said. Ryanair is planning to cut 3,000 jobs and reduce staff pay by up to a fifth in response to the Covid-19 crisis, which has grounded flights. The no-frills airline said it did not expect passenger numbers or pricing to return to pre-coronavirus levels until summer 2022 at the earliest. As part of a programme of sweeping cost cuts, Ryanair said it could close a number of bases across Europe until air travel recovers. The company, which expects to report a net loss of more than €100m (£87m) for the first quarter and through the summer, said restructuring and job losses would start in July. The job cuts will affect mostly pilots and cabin crew, although the measures will also hit head office and back office teams. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has opened Queensland’s border in preparation for next month’s restart of the National Rugby League (NRL) season. Palaszczuk not only gave the green light for the state’s three NRL clubs to train at their base and travel interstate, but also host home games. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison had said earlier on Friday it would be a matter for state jurisdictions to clear any resumption of sporting activities, following a meeting of the national cabinet. Hungary needs to prepare for a potential second wave of the coronavirus outbreak in October-November, even though the spreading of the virus will likely slow in the summer, prime minister Viktor Orbán told state radio on Friday, according to a report by Reuters. Orban also said if authorities manage to reduce the death rate from the pandemic in Budapest, where 80% of deaths have been recorded, only then will current restrictions be eased in the capital city. Hungary will lift a large part of restrictions in the countryside from Monday. Migrant workers on Spanish farms that provide fruit and vegetables for UK supermarkets are trapped in dire conditions under lockdown, living in cardboard and plastic shelters without food or running water. Thousands of workers, many of them undocumented, live in settlements between huge greenhouses on farms in the southern Spanish provinces of Huelva and Almeria, key regions for European supply chains. Local union activists have been supporting the migrants, bringing them water, food and basic supplies since Spain declared a lockdown in mid March. Clare Carlile from Ethical Consumer, a UK charity supporting the local activists, says the situation is the result of years of neglect of workers. “They got visited by the Spanish army on 18 March and told to stay put, even though in some places running water is several kilometres away. Now, with Covid fears, a water truck comes twice a week. If you are at work and miss it you must walk several kilometres for water after a hard day. “Failure of employers provide basic rights has for years created dire circumstances for the inhabitants of the settlements. Now, the pandemic has pushed the situation to crisis point.” London’s Heathrow airport, traditionally the busiest in Europe, said passenger numbers were expected to be down by around 97% in April. Reuters reports that for the first quarter, revenue fell 12.7% to £593m ($745m) and adjusted EBITDA fell by 22.4% to £315m. Heathrow expects passenger numbers to remain weak until governments across the world fighting the coronavirus outbreak deem it safe to travel. The airport said it had £3.2bn in liquidity, sufficient to maintain the business at least over the next 12 months, even with no passengers. Morning, I’m Aamna Mohdin taking over the liveblog from my colleague Helen. Please do send tips and comments to aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com or you can tweet me at @aamnamohdin Carmela Fonbuena reports for the Guardian: Philippine provinces considered to have a low to moderate number of coronavirus cases began easing lockdowns on Friday 1 May, amid concerns from local officials and residents who are wary that the real scale of the outbreak cannot be known until the country conducts more testing. “Many provinces are still just seeing imported cases from other areas. When [strict lockdowns are] lifted they expect imported cases to come in,” said former health secretary Manuel Dayrit. The rules remain unclear. The government initially said religious gatherings will be allowed provided physical distancing is observed, but it’s now under review following concerns raised. The Philippines recorded 8,488 cases as of 30 April, including 568 deaths. The numbers are believed to be higher as the country of 110 million people has tested less than 100,000 individuals. It’s a testament to its poor healthcare system as many hospitals struggle to meet requirements for coronavirus testing. The decision made by a national government taskforce on coronavirus put several local officials in a difficult position. In the provinces of Ilocos Norte, La Union, and Albay, where residents oppose the government decision, local leaders cannot extend strict lockdowns without government approval. “Lifting will only return the virus into a second wave,” said Joey Salceda, a lawmaker from Albay province, which recorded three deaths among total 28 cases but he is afraid there are undetected cases. Metro Manila will remain in strict lockdown but certain restrictions will be lifted to allow some government infrastructure work to continue. Groups of overseas Filipino workers stranded in the capital due to provincial lockdowns have been allowed go home, too. Although this development is definitely worth mentioning again, too: With that, I’m ducking away. My colleague Aamna Mohdin will be with you for the next few hours. Here are the most important developments from the last few hours: 1 million people have recovered from coronavirus. According to Johns Hopkins University data, more than a million people have now recovered from coronavirus infection, with the total at 1,014,524. Infections worldwide stand at 3,256,570. More than 233,300 people have died in the pandemic so far. Boris Johnson says UK ‘past the peak’. The prime minister promised to set out next week how schools and workplaces could safely reopen once lockdown restrictions were eased, as he claimed the UK was past the peak of the coronavirus outbreak. Despite announcing an increase of 674 in the death toll of the virus, taking it to a total of 26,771, Johnson suggested the worst was over. US jobless toll amounts to 18.4% of working-age population. Thirty million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits since 21 March. The White House let its two-week-old economic reopening guidelines expire on Thursday as half of all US states forged ahead with their own strategies for easing restrictions on restaurants, retail and other businesses shuttered by the coronavirus crisis, Reuters reports. Trump claims he has seen evidence that Covid-19 originated in Wuhan lab. When the president was asked if he has seen anything that gives you a “high degree of confidence” that coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Donald Trump replied: “Yes, I have.” His own government experts say the virus was ‘not manmade or genetically modified’. US intelligence agencies have been under pressure to link coronavirus to Chinese labs. Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, later said of the lab theory: “What we have before us doesn’t suggest that is a likely source”. Protesters, some armed, gather inside Michigan state capitol. Hundreds of protesters, some armed, gathered inside Michigan’s state capitol on Thursday as state lawmakers debated the Democratic governor’s request to extend her emergency powers to combat coronavirus.

British BAME Covid-19 death rate ‘more than twice that of whites’. The death rate among British black Africans and British Pakistanis from coronavirus in English hospitals is more than 2.5 times that of the white population, according to stark analysis by the Institute of Fiscal Studies. UK food banks face record demand. The first two weeks of the coronavirus lockdown triggered an unprecedented rise in food bank use as the economy was hit and household incomes plunged, data from hundreds of emergency food aid charities reveals. Jacinda Ardern’s popularity surges during lockdown. An opinion poll in New Zealand has found the prime minister’s approval rating jumped to 65% during the country’s nearly five-week strict lockdown. It puts her in a strong position ahead of this year’s general election. Her Labour party also did well, achieving a 55% approval rating. ‘Australia has earned an early mark’ Australia has brought forward its decision on easing restrictions to next Friday 8 May in a further sign that the country is successfully flattening the curve. Australia, which in late March recorded around 400 new cases of the virus a day, now consistently has fewer than 20 new cases daily. Restrictions on movement were put into place at the end of March, including the closure of schools in some states, as well as restaurants, pubs and some businesses, as well as restrictions on the number of people who can gather together. Prime Minister Scott Morrison was due to announce which of these restrictions would be lifted on 11 May after discussion with state premiers, but says the announcement has been brought forward three days, with a cheerful Morrison telling a press conference on Friday that “Australians have earned an early mark.” He added that “we didn’t expect to be in this position six weeks ago”. Australia’s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said Australia will begin testing cohorts of asymptomatic people in an attempt to ensure early detection of any new outbreaks and avoid a second wave. That cluster testing will be focused on groups that have a high risk of exposure or work with vulnerable people, like aged care workers or healthcare workers. Teachers are among those who might get tested. Says Murphy: We need to test more people. If we are going to get on top of those small outbreaks ... we cannot afford to have an outbreak that takes off so that we get a second wave when we reduce restrictions such as a number of other countries have seen. So our testing has to be very good. He says that the case data shows that most people who transmit the virus do still have symptoms, so anyone with any symptoms should get tested. The most important thing in testing is for anyone who has respiratory symptoms, a cough or a cold or a sore throat, to get tested ... get tested and don’t go to work. Cholera and coronavirus: why we must not repeat the same mistakes Coronavirus is not the only pandemic the world faces. There is another one raging right now. Since cholera first spread across the globe, two centuries ago, it has killed about 50 million people. In the time it takes you to read this article, another five people will have died from it. It is now mostly ignored in the west, but in other parts of the world, it has never gone away. While I will surely be able to offer my patients in England a coronavirus vaccine in a year or two, and while western health systems will be reinforced to be more ready for a potential future outbreak, I worry that we may repeat the mistakes of cholera: conquering coronavirus everywhere except for the poorest parts of the world. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is addressing the media now. He has been asked about US President Donald Trump’s comments late on Thursday. Trump said he had seen evidence that Covid-19 emerged from a laboratory in Wuhan, contradicting experts in his own administration who said it was not man made or genetically modified. Morrison said he has not seen any evidence to suggest that’s the case, but says Australia is still pushing for an independent investigation into the origin of the disease. What we have before us doesn’t suggest that that is the likely source. There’s nothing that we have that would suggest that that is the likely source but you can’t rule anything out in this scenario. He says the virus did originate in Wuhan, but “the most likely scenario that has been canvassed related to wildlife wet markets”. That is why Australia wants an “objective independent” investigation, he says. While that can’t be ruled out its not something we have seen any hard evidence of that that is the position. Morrison says an independent investigation would look at what happened and why it happened. So we can learn if something similar could happen in any part of the world so the world will be able to respond quicker. Because clearly in these cases time is everything. 1 million people have recovered. According to Johns Hopkins University data, more than a million people have now recovered from coronavirus infection, with the total currently at 1,014,524.Infections worldwide stand at 3,256,570.233,363 people have died in the pandemic so far.

Russian prime minister diagnosed with coronavirus. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has said he has been diagnosed with coronavirus and will self-isolate from the government in the country’s highest-profile case of the disease yet. Demand for coronavirus tests raises concerns over HIV and malaria Governments were caught out when Covid-19 hit, having overlooked the need to be able to test for new diseases because they were focused on drugs and vaccines for those they already knew about. Now there are fears that the rush to supply wealthier countries pressing for more tests may destabilise the fight against HIV, malaria and tuberculosis, illnesses that kill millions, mostly in low- and middle-income countries. “Some companies are planning to reduce or stop malaria, HIV and TB test production,” said Dr Catharina Boehme, the chief executive of the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (Find) and an adviser to the World Health Organization. “They are shifting their production to Covid-19 tests.” Boehme said companies could get about 18 cents for a rapid malaria test and $10 for a Covid-19 test. The Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria said it was concerned about “any action that might reduce the availability of tests or treatment for HIV, TB or malaria” The eels at a Japanese aquarium are lonely – and the aquarium staff are urging people to video call the creatures so that they do not grow too shy, AFP reports. The Sumida Aquarium, housed in the landmark Tokyo Skytree tower, has been closed since the start of March and its animals have become used to a largely human-free environment during the two-month calm. The “unprecedented situation” was having some unexpected downsides. “Creatures in the aquarium don’t see humans except keepers and they have started forgetting about humans,” it said on its Twitter account this week. “Garden eels in particular disappear into the sand and hide every time the keepers pass by.” That is causing difficulties for keepers trying to check on the health of the animals. In a bid to reacquaint the eels with humans, the aquarium is setting up five tablets facing the tank housing the delicate creatures, with eel enthusiasts asked to connect through iPhones or iPads via the FaceTime app. Once the video calls start, people are supposed to show their faces, wave and talk to the eels. But given the tender nature of the animals, callers are asked not to shout. Whistleblower complaint set to lift lid on Trump pressure to push untried drug Donald Trump’s musing over whether cleaning people’s lungs with disinfectant might treat the coronavirus caused a furore but it may be the US president’s pushing of anti-malarial drugs that does far more lasting damage to his administration. There is building anticipation over the content of an upcoming whistleblower complaint by Dr Rick Bright, who last week was abruptly removed as the head of the federal government office working on a vaccine for Covid-19. It is understood that Bright is still working on the details of the complaint before lodging it with the Department of Health and Human Services’ inspector general. Bright, a vaccines expert, has claimed he was removed as head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (Barda) because he resisted an effort to expand the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat Covid-19. The drugs, approved to treat malaria, have yet to be proven effective for this new use but have been repeatedly promoted by Trump, who has called them a “game-changer”. Tony Allen, legendary drummer and Afrobeat co-founder, dies aged 79 The Nigerian drummer Tony Allen, who is credited with creating Afrobeat along with his old bandmate Fela Kuti, died suddenly at the age of 79 in Paris on Thursday, his manager said. “We don’t know the exact cause of death,” Eric Trosset said, adding it was not linked to the coronavirus. “He was in great shape, it was quite sudden. I spoke to him at 1pm then two hours later he was sick and taken to Pompidou hospital, where he died.” Allen was the drummer and musical director of Fela Kuti’s band Africa ’70 in the 1960s and 70s, AFP reports. During that time the pair created Afrobeat, combining west African musical styles such as highlife and fuji music with US jazz and funk. Afrobeat went on to become one of the totemic genres of 20th century African music. Over Allen’s thrilling beat, Kuti laid out his revolutionary and pan-African message, which led him to become one of the abiding icons of the struggle for freedom across the continent. US President Donald Trump claims he has seen evidence of Covid-19 originating in a Wuhan lab. When asked at a press briefing if he has seen anything that gives you a “high degree of confidence” that coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, President Trump replied: “Yes, I have.” He added that he was “not allowed” to tell reporters what that evidence was: The White House let its 2-week-old economic reopening guidelines expire on Thursday as half of all US states forged ahead with their own strategies for easing restrictions on restaurants, retail and other businesses shuttered by the coronavirus crisis, Reuters reports. The enormous pressure on states to reopen, despite a lack of wide-scale virus testing and other safeguards urged by health experts, was highlighted in new Labor Department data showing some 30 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits since 21 March. The jobless toll amounts to more than 18.4% of the US working-age population, a level not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Physical separation of people - by closing schools, businesses and other places of social gatherings - remains the chief weapon against a highly contagious respiratory virus with no vaccine and no cure. But with economic pain reaching historic proportions, agitation to relax stay-at-home orders and mandatory workplace restrictions has mounted. For the second time in two weeks, hundreds of protesters - including armed militia group members - thronged Michigan’s state Capitol in Lansing demanding an end to Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s stay-at-home orders. The latest protest was sparked by the Democratic governor’s request, ignored by Republican lawmakers, to extend emergency powers she had invoked in a state hard hit by both the virus and closures to combat it. US President Donald Trump will leave the White House on Friday for the first time in a month when he travels to the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland. Trump will make the 70-mile (113 km) trip to Camp David on Friday evening, according to a schedule released by the White House on Thursday night. The schedule did not indicate how long Trump would stay at Camp David. Trump has been holding regular press events at the White House to highlight his administration’s efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Trump’s last trip away from the White House was on 28 March to Norfolk, Virginia, where he bid farewell to the Navy’s USNS Comfort hospital ship as it sailed to New York City to help take the pressure off civilian hospitals. Trump, who faces re-election in November, said on Wednesday he would visit Arizona next week for an “industry”-related event. Dan Collyns reports for the Guardian from Lima: Municipal authorities in Peru shut down a bustling street market in Lima on Thursday after a spot test for Covid-19 revealed one in five stallholders were infected with the virus. Out of 842 stallholders, 163 tested positive for the virus when a team of medics with military backup descended on the Caquéta food market in the working-class San Martín de Porres district in downtown Lima on Wednesday. Most Peruvians shop in open-air or covered food markets rather than supermarkets, where prices are more negotiable and markedly cheaper. But social distancing and sanitary guidelines are regularly flouted as punters haggle for bargains and stallholders make special offers to attract more customers. Markets were “hot spots” for Covid-19, Peru’s defence minister Walter Martos told journalists as he took part in the surprise inspection on Wednesday which revealed the virus’ increasing hold on the country’s population even as a stringent lockdown was nearing the end of its seventh week. “We know that this market is major convergence point and we have seen on our hotspots map that around this market there’s a large number of infected [people],” Martos said. Peru’s President Martín Vizcarra said it was a stern warning to maintain social distancing: “These 163 [stallholders] have to stay at home and keep their distance to avoid infecting others.” “When you go to buy potatoes or lettuce, you could be taking Covid-19 into your homes as an extra,” he said, using the Quechua word ‘Yapa’, which means a bonus portion offered to loyal customers. President Vizcarra has been praised by Peruvians for his swift and decisive response to Covid-19 enforcing one of the earliest lockdowns in Latin America. Nonetheless, the Andean country’s curve of infection has continued to rise and it had Latin America’s second-highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases after Brazil, with 36,976 confirmed cases and 1,051 deaths on Thursday. Poverty has been a major obstacle to the enforcement of the lockdown. Thousands have been trying to leave Lima in recent weeks, many saying they had to choose between hunger or homelessness in the city or the risk of exposure to Covid-19 as they attempt to return to their rural hometowns. Podcast: Who is Covid-19 killing? More than 26,000 people in the UK have officially been recorded as having died from the coronavirus. In this episode we look beyond the headline figure at who is dying – and hear from friends and family about the lives cut short: According to Johns Hopkins University data, more than a million people have now recovered from coronavirus infection, with the total currently at 1,014,524. Infections worldwide stand at 3,256,570. 233,363 people have died in the pandemic so far. Jacinda Ardern and her government soar in popularity during coronavirus crisis Charles Anderson reports for the Guardian: New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, reached an almost record-breaking approval rating while the country was in its strictest lockdown, according to a new leaked poll. The poll, which was conducted by UMR and leaked to the New Zealand Herald, shows that Ardern’s Labour party has reached 55% approval, while the opposition National party has dropped to 29% – its lowest rating in more than a decade. The Greens were on 5% and New Zealand First – Labour’s Coalition partners – on 6%. Ardern’s personal approval rating was 65% while the opposition leader, Simon Bridges, sat on 7%, according to the poll. It puts the PM close to her high of 70% approval in UMR polls during her term in office. The poll also shows that 78% of New Zealanders believe the country is heading in the right direction – the highest since 1991. Nature is healing: China reported 12 new coronavirus cases for 30 April, up from four a day earlier, data from the country’s health authority showed on Friday. Six of the cases were imported, the National Health Commission (NHC) said, up from four a day earlier. Of the domestic transmission cases, five were in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang and one in the northern region of Inner Mongolia. China reported no domestic transmission cases a day earlier. The NHC also reported 25 new asymptomatic cases for April 30, down from 33 a day earlier. The total number of confirmed cases in the country has reached 82,874. With no new deaths on Thursday, the toll remained at 4,633. Jair Bolsonaro says footballers in Brazil have ‘a small chance of dying’ from Covid-19 Brazil’s president Jair Bolsonaro wants to see football competitions restart soon despite the country’s high number of coronavirus cases, arguing that players are less likely to die from Covid-19 because of their physical fitness, Associated Press reports. Bolsonaro is one of the few world leaders that still downplays the risks brought by the coronavirus, which he has likened to “a little flu”. Most leagues in Brazil were suspended on 15 March. The Brazilian championship was scheduled to begin in May, but that looks unlikely as the country has become a coronavirus hot spot with more than 5,900 deaths. Doctors say the peak of the pandemic is expected to hit within two weeks. Brazil’s president said his new health minister will issue a suggestion that games return without any fans in the stadiums, but he acknowledged many players might be reluctant. “The decision to restart soccer is not mine, but we can help,” Bolsonaro said, adding he has spoken with Gremio coach Renato Portaluppi about the issue and was told that players are still worried about the virus. Neighbouring Argentina has already cancelled the rest of the 2019-2020 season because of the pandemic. France also decided to end the season, declaring Paris Saint-Germain as league champions on Thursday. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. India’s film industry, purveyor of song-and-dance spectacles to millions, will take at least two years to recover financially from the coronavirus pandemic, which is threatening big-ticket projects, putting at risk tens of thousands of jobs, Reuters reports. That was the sombre assessment of about a dozen top producers, distributors and actors from Bollywood, the movie industry in India’s commercial capital of Mumbai, during a video conference this week, one of the participants said. Such dim prospects, even after the lockdown is lifted, threaten the box-office takings that make up 60% of industry earnings, spurring producers to say big-budget films and extravagant shoots in foreign locations will be shelved. Bollywood has come to a grinding halt, with film production and theatres shut nationwide, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed a 40-day lockdown to curb the virus, which has infected 31,000 people and killed more than 1,000 in India. About 9,500 theatres are shut, and business at multiplexes and single-screen cinemas is unlikely to bounce back for weeks or even months, as infection fears linger and discretionary spending plunges. Shares in India’s two largest multiplex operators, PVR and INOX Leisure, have plunged more than 40% from all-time highs in late February. Brokerage Emkay also slashed its rating on both to “hold” from “buy”, saying they would suffer declines of more than 50% in visitor numbers, ticket sales, advertising revenue and food and beverage sales in fiscal 2020-21. Trump claims to have evidence coronavirus started in Chinese lab but offers no details Donald Trump claimed to have seen evidence to substantiate the unproven theory that the coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, despite US intelligence agencies’ conclusion that the virus was “not manmade or genetically modified”. “We’re going to see where it comes from,” Trump said at a White House event on Thursday. “We have people looking at it very, very strongly. Scientific people, intelligence people, and others. We’re going to put it all together. I think we will have a very good answer eventually. And China might even tell us.” Pressed to explain what evidence he had seen that the virus originated in a Chinese lab, Trump responded, “I can’t tell you that. I’m not allowed to tell you that.” Prior to the White House event, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the clearinghouse for the web of US spy agencies, issued a statement asserting that the intelligence community “concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified”. “The intelligence community will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan,” the statement added. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Ms Du, door sensors and me: life with a Beijing Covid-19 quarantine handler Every day for the last two weeks I have spoken with Ms Du, a mild-mannered, middle-aged woman who is my quarantine handler. She calls me in the morning to remind me to send her my temperature. She calls again if I forget to send the afternoon reading. She texts rose emojis, reminding me to “please cooperate” with the rules. If I open my door, equipped with a sensor, to put the rubbish in the hall or pick up a delivery, she immediately calls and reminds me to let her know beforehand. After returning from a reporting trip to Wuhan, I have been in strict self-isolation in my apartment in Beijing. Most days I get calls not just from Du but the local police station, perhaps checking the spelling of my name, someone from the health department asking about my travel history, or other representatives from the neighbourhood committee. They send messages reminding me to cover my mouth when coughing and not to “spit wherever you please”. The calls and questions, politely made, are constant and after a few days I already feel harried. A pink slip of paper with hearts taped to my door alerts my neighbours how long my quarantine should last: France will contribute €50 per person towards bicycle repairs after a nationwide coronavirus lockdown ends on 11 May, taking an innovative step to encourage cycling and reduce overcrowding in metros and buses, where it is hard to practice the social distancing required to prevent virus transmission. Environment Minister Elisabeth Borne announced on Thursday a €20 million ($22 million) plan for repairing bicycles, installing temporary bike parking spaces and financing cycling coaching sessions. Borne said the government will also accelerate a programme allowing employers to cover up to €400 of travel costs of staff who cycle to work. “We want this period to be a new stage towards a cycling culture and we want the bicycle to be the queen of deconfinement,” Borne said on her Twitter feed. Remdesivir: five Australian hospitals to receive experimental coronavirus drug The US pharmaceutical company Gilead is finalising the location of five hospitals in Australia to receive the highly sought-after experimental Covid-19 drug remdesivir. The only confirmed location is St Vincent’s hospital in Sydney, a major tertiary hospital and the centre of many of the New South Wales outbreak areas. A NSW Health spokeswoman confirmed the health department “has been engaging with Gilead on gaining access to the drug for Covid-19 patients”. The news comes as the doctor informing the Covid-19 response in the White House, the immunologist Dr Anthony Fauci, promoted preliminary findings from a joint Gilead and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases study that suggested remdesivir could improve recovery time of patients. His comments have revived global hope in the drug, with no treatments now available for the virus. The death rate among British black Africans and British Pakistanis from coronavirus in English hospitals is more than 2.5 times that of the white population, according to stark analysis by the Institute of Fiscal Studies. The highly respected thinktank also found that deaths of people from a black Caribbean background were 1.7 times higher than for white Britons. NHS England figures published last week showed that hospital deaths per 100,000 among British people of a black Caribbean background were three times the equivalent number among the majority white British population. However, unlike previous analysis, the IFS research, published on Friday, strips out the role of age, gender and geography and shows that they do not explain the disparities. The first two weeks of the coronavirus lockdown triggered an unprecedented rise in food bank use as the economy was hit and household incomes plunged, data from hundreds of emergency food aid charities reveals. The Trussell Trust, the UK’s biggest food bank network, said it experienced its busiest ever period after lockdown was announced on 23 March, when it issued 50,000 food parcels in the space of a week, almost double its usual volume. A similar picture emerged from the Independent Food Aid Network (Ifan), which said its food banks recorded a 59% increase in demand for emergency food support between February and March – 17 times higher than the same period a year ago. Just a donkey named Earl playing with a purple ball: Here’s the full story on the armed protestors in Michigan: American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines said Thursday they will soon require passengers to cover their faces during flights, following the lead of JetBlue Airways, Reuters reports. The move comes as airlines big and small contemplate how to comply with social-distancing recommendations in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. Most flights are nearly empty these days air travel is down 95% from a year ago, and the average domestic flight has 17 passengers, according to industry figures. This week, JetBlue became the first US airline to announce it will require passengers to wear face coverings during flights, starting next week. Wearing a face covering isn’t about protecting yourself, its about protecting those around you, said JetBlue President Joanna Geraghty. This is the new flying etiquette. Earlier Thursday, Frontier Airlines said that it would begin requiring masks 8 May. Delta and United announced they would make masks mandatory starting Monday. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Thursday that downstate New York’s entire public transport system (which includes New York City and Long Island) would be disinfected every 24 hours. He also said he would need an “army” of between 6,400 and 17,000 people to trace the contacts of people who have tested positive for the novel coronavirus as part of a strategy to limit outbreaks. Cuomo said that former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg would, in coordination with Johns Hopkins University, oversee the recruitment and training of these “contact tracers” and make the program available to governments worldwide. Hundreds of protesters, some armed, gathered inside Michigan’s state capitol on Thursday as state lawmakers debated the Democratic governor’s request to extend her emergency powers to combat coronavirus. A tightly packed crowd of protesters, some carrying rifles, attempted to enter the floor of the legislative chamber, and were held back by a line of state police and capitol staff, according to video footage posted by local journalists. “Let us in! Let us in!” the protesters chanted, as they stood shoulder-to-shoulder inside the statehouse. Few of them were wearing face masks. Some of the protesters shouted anti-government slogans, including comparing Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer to Hitler. One Democratic state lawmaker posted a photograph of men with rifles standing in a gallery yelling down at lawmakers below. “Some of my colleagues who own bullet proof vests are wearing them,” state senator Dayna Polehanki, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter. A spokeswoman for the Michigan senate minority leader that at least one lawmaker was wearing a bullet-proof vest. The footage from the protest sparked strong reactions from many Americans. One Black Lives Matter organizer commented on the striking difference between the reaction to unarmed black Americans protesting police violence and armed white Americans protesting against public health measures.

UK prime minister Boris Johnson has announced that the country is “past the peak”. Johnson – who has just returned to work after a bout of coronavirus, and the birth of his son – also said that the NHS has not been overwhelmed at any stage. US president Donald Trump meanwhile has claimed to have evidence that Covid-19 originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, despite his own government experts saying the virus was “not manmade or genetically modified”. US intelligence agencies have been under pressure to link coronavirus to Chinese labs, the Guardian’s Patrick Wintour reports: Here are the most important developments from the last few hours: UK prime minister says the country now “past the peak”. Boris Johnson defended the decisions the UK government has taken. Speaking at the UK government’s daily press conference, Johnson said that the NHS has not been overwhelmed at any stage.

72	As Australia’s coronavirus outbreak continues, a lot of important news has slipped under the radar. From Angus Taylor v Clover Moore, to a looming byelection, and back to the Taylor family’s Grasslands saga, here are the stories you may have missed over the past week. And here is last week’s list of stories – in case you missed those. New details emerge in Angus Taylor document saga After police told New South Wales parliament there was no evidence Angus Taylor’s office had a downloaded an altered City of Sydney document from the council’s website, the minister’s response was to make a distinction between “downloading” and “accessing”. Last year, Taylor used the false document, which contained incorrect figures on council travel, to attack the City of Sydney mayor, Clover Moore, and maintained he had accessed from the council’s website. It emerged this week that NSW police had told the state parliament there was no evidence the documents had been downloaded from the council website, leading to Taylor’s distinction between “download” and “accessing”. Moore, who was also concerned by reports Taylor was not interviewed by police, said it was “nearly beyond belief” Taylor had still not explained the origin of the altered document. Obama White House team watched Gillard’s misogyny speech – a lot In an interview with the podcast A Rational Fear, Obama White House adviser Ben Rhodes revealed the former president’s team would often watch Julia Gillard’s misogyny speech when they were “really annoyed” with Tony Abbott. Rhodes, Obama’s former deputy national security adviser, said the team was often frustrated with the former Coalition PM over his positions on climate change, particularly during the lead-up to the Paris agreement. He did not say whether the former president was among the viewers of Gillard’s speech. In the podcast, Rhodes also revealed how Obama “went way off the script” to blast the Abbott government during a visit to Brisbane for the G20 summit. Investigation finds Taylor-linked company poisoned endangered grasslands A much-anticipated report by the federal environment department concluded a company part-owned by Angus Taylor illegally poisoned critically endangered grasslands in the New South Wales Monaro region. Jam Land, which Taylor part-owns with his brother Richard, was ordered to restore 103 hectares of native grassland three and a half years after poisoning the land on a property in Corrowong. The company avoided a fine and criminal finding, and the company intends to have the decision reviewed. Angus Taylor said he has no direct or controlling interest in the company. Labor the Greens have called for Taylor to resign, citing meetings he sought with senior environment officials about the grasslands while the review was under way. He denies any wrongdoing. McKenzie’s sports grants submission fails to explain role PM’s office Bridget McKenzie, who quit as sports minister while engulfed in the sports grants scandal, lodged a bulky response to a Senate inquiry that still failed to explain the role of Scott Morrison’s office in rejigging sports funding on the day the last election was called. McKenzie insisted she was not aware of applications for funds being colour-coded according to the party representing the electorate. However, it is likely the former Nationals deputy leader will be directly questioned on matters by the committee next month. Leaked report shows government told to ban fracking in Lake Eyre basin The Guardian obtained a leaked report that revealed the Queensland government was urged by experts to ban fracking in the environmentally sensitive Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre basin. The government had blocked report’s release after granting gas companies new exploration rights, infuriating conservation groups who called for the findings to be made public. Labor MPs quits, setting up Covid byelection Labor MP Mike Kelly, the member for Eden-Monaro, announced he would resign from parliament, citing health issues incurred while he was a serviceman. It sets up a federal byelection contest during the Covid-19 pandemic that could be expected to canvass the government’s response to both the pandemic and the recent bushfires which ravaged the area, as well as other local issues. Labor is expected to preselect the mayor of Bega Valley shire, while the NSW deputy premier, Nationals leader John Barilaro, is considering whether to throw his hat in the ring.
73	California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, promised “meaningful” adjustments to stay-at-home orders in the coming days as thousands of protesters gathered across the state in defiance of the lockdown. Demonstrations took place from the capital of Sacramento to San Francisco and San Diego, while large crowds turned out in Orange county’s Huntington Beach, a recent flashpoint after Newsom ordered beaches there to close. Newsom said that the state was “getting very close” to making changes that would affect how businesses, including restaurants, could operate, and urged residents to be patient. He said the announcement of the changes would come in “days, not weeks”. Nearly 3,000 people protested in Huntington Beach on Friday, the city’s police chief told the OC Register. The Huntington Beach protest followed the closure of beaches in Orange county after a weekend when tens of thousands of people hit the sands south of Los Angeles county, which had been closed for weeks. Newsom scolded local residents for defying the spirit of the stay-at-home order, and responded by ordering all beaches in the county to temporarily close. “I served in the army and fought tyrants and dictators overseas and this has gone too far,” one protester told the Los Angeles Times. “I didn’t do that to come back here and live under a tyrant in my own country.” Many of the Huntington Beach protesters brought their children along with them, the Los Angeles Times reported, with one protester saying he had come with his wife and three young children because it was important to show that the protesters are “normal people”. In Sacramento, the state’s capital, a packed crowd of protesters faced off with lines of riot cops in a tense and chaotic protest on Friday afternoon. “Traitors!” the protesters screamed at police, according to a livestream of the protest produced by reporters from the Sacramento Bee. Some protesters held signs promoting anti-vaccine conspiracies or questioning whether the coronavirus is real, while others protested the closure of businesses during the pandemic, arguing that all jobs are essential. Almost none of the protesters were wearing masks, according to reporters and photographers at the scene. The California Highway Patrol (CHP) had announced that it would be barring protests at the capitol because of a lack of social distancing by participants at a previous rally, but protesters gathered on the steps of the building regardless, chanting “Whose house? Our house!” The CHP repeatedly ordered the protesters to disperse, the Sacramento Bee reported, and by 3pm, a line of law enforcement in full riot gear had slowly pushed protesters back from the capitol steps towards the street. Other protests were smaller: only about 150 people rallied in San Francisco, and hundreds in San Diego, according to local news reports. The rallies across California against Newsom’s stay-at-home orders came as a rural county in northern California became the first to defy statewide orders by allowing nonessential businesses to reopen and diners to eat in restaurants. Modoc county, in the state’s far north-east, near Oregon, had no Covid-19 cases, a local official told the Associated Press. In his Friday news conference, Newsom said he empathized with the protesters’ “frustration and concern and deeply understandable anxiety about the economy and the fate and future of their families”, and said that the state was trying to work closely to respond to the concerns of more rural areas of the state. “We’re paying attention to you,” Newsom said, speaking to the state’s rural residents. “We recognize the economic pain.” But the availability of testing for coronavirus had also lagged in rural areas, Newsom said later, highlighting the dangers of reopening the economy too quickly. Asked about his response to protesters calling him a tyrant and a fascist, Newsom simply urged Californians to “take care of yourself”. “Wear a face covering,” he said. “Do justice to physical distancing. You don’t want to contract this disease.” People who showed no symptoms could still spread the virus, Newsom warned the protesters. “Protect yourself. Protect your family. Protect your kids, your parents.” The governor passed on responsibility to local law enforcement officials for dealing with the fraught question of whether protesters who were violating social distancing guidelines should be arrested. He said he could not possibly monitor and respond to every protest happening across the state. “I have confidence in local law enforcement, incredible confidence,” Newsom said. In Sacramento, where many protesters were flouting social distancing guidelines, at least one person had been arrested, according to the Sacramento Bee. Newsom defended his announcement that changes in shelter-in-place would come in “many days”, rather than weeks, and said that the move was motivated by the data, not just by the political resistance bubbling up across the state. More than 2,000 people have died of coronavirus in California so far, including 91 people in the previous day, but the number of patients in intensive care units stayed flat, and the total number of hospitalizations had fallen slightly, both signs of progress justifying a move towards some changes in the emergency order, Newsom said. But, “We can screw all that up and set all that back by making bad decisions,” Newsom said, adding that these positive signed are only possible “because people have done an incredible job in their physical distancing,” he said. “Thousands of people congregating together, not practicing social distancing or physical distancing,” could undermine the current progress in preventing the spread of the virus, the governor said. “If we can avoid that, we can get to the other side with modifications a lot quicker.” Agencies contributed reporting
74	US regulators have allowed the emergency use of the experimental drug remdesivir, which appears to help some coronavirus patients recover faster. It is the first drug shown to help fight Covid-19, which has killed more than 230,000 people worldwide. Donald Trump announced the news on Friday at the White House alongside Stephen Hahn, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner, who said the drug would be available for patients hospitalized with Covid-19. The president said the approval represented a “very promising situation” in the country’s fight against coronavirus, and Dr Deborah Birx added, “I think this really illustrates what can happen in such a short time.” The emergency approval comes days after Dr Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, expressed cautious optimism about the results of a remdesivir drug trial. “The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,” Fauci said earlier this week. “What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus.” The FDA acted after preliminary results from a government-sponsored study showed that Gilead Sciences’s remdesivir shortened the time to recovery by 31%, or about four days on average, for hospitalized Covid-19 patients. The study of 1,063 patients is the largest and most strict test of the drug and included a comparison group that received just usual care so remdesivir’s effects could be rigorously evaluated. Those given the drug were able to leave the hospital in 11 days on average versus 15 days for the comparison group. The drug also might be reducing deaths, although that’s not certain from the partial results revealed so far. Fauci said the drug would become a new standard of care for severely ill Covid-19 patients like those in this study. The drug has not been tested on people with milder illness, and currently is given through an IV in a hospital. The FDA authorized the drug under its emergency powers to quickly speed experimental drugs, tests and other medical products to patients during public health crises. In normal times the FDA requires “substantial evidence” of a drug’s safety and effectiveness, usually through one or more large, rigorously controlled patient studies. But during public health emergencies the agency can waive those standards, simply requiring that an experimental drug’s potential benefits outweigh its risks. No drugs are approved now for treating the coronavirus, and remdesivir will still need formal approval. The FDA can convert the drug’s status to full approval if Gilead or other researchers provide additional data of remdesivir’s safety and effectiveness. Use of the drug will be authorized for adults or children who are hospitalized with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 and whose condition is “severe”, meaning they have low blood oxygen levels, need oxygen therapy or are on a mechanical ventilator, the FDA said. “Based on evaluation of the emergency use authorization criteria and the scientific evidence available, it was determined that it is reasonable to believe that remdesivir may be effective in treating Covid-19, and that, given there are no adequate, approved or available alternative treatments, the known and potential benefits to treat this serious or life-threatening virus currently outweigh the known and potential risks of the drug’s use,” the FDA said in its statement. The emergency use authorization (EUA) also includes information about possible side effects, which include “increased levels of liver enzymes, which may be a sign of inflammation or damage to cells in the liver; and infusion-related reactions, which may include low blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, sweating and shivering”. It also notes that there may be other serious side effects that have not been discovered yet. The EUA requires hospitals to monitor patients’ liver enzymes through blood tests before the treatment is started and every day that treatment is ongoing. Patients who receive the drug will be provided with a fact sheet, which is available here. The drug is administered through an IV once a day for up to 10 days. Hahn said the drug’s approval for emergency use represented “an important clinical advance” in the fight against coronavirus. Daniel O’Day, the Gilead CEO, said Friday that his company has already ramped up production of the drug and hopes to make millions of treatment courses available by the end of the year. “I think it’s important to note that this is a medicine for the most severe patients,” O’Day told the Today show. “What we see here is really, of course, not a cure but a very, very significant and important treatment for patients.” Agencies contributed reporting
75	It is hard to imagine the body-blow of the “dining table revolution”, which the Chinese government is now encouraging as a means to hold down Covid-19 infection rates by reducing general physical contact. Designated serving spoons, no double-dipping, even individual portions rather than family-size sharing platters, have all been floated as part of a new need for safety. When you think of the banquet style of a classic Chinese meal, a table heaving with dishes so varied and communal that you need the table to spin if you want to get round it, the lonely portions of the solitary eater are going to seem like quite a comedown. European cuisine may also struggle to adjust. The convention of individual portions, known as the Russian service, came to prominence in the 1810s in mainland Europe (though much later in Britain) and was basically a way to prove how rich you were (because you could afford the servants – it is much more labour-intensive to bring dishes out one person at a time). The French service that came before it, tables laden with sharing plates, was effortlessly blown away by the emotional appeal of ostentation. This century, though, the huge platter has come back to prominence. Spanish tapas took off and spread its conventions (lots of tiny, shared plates) across many different cuisines. Italian cuisine has its bursting, shareable antipasto tradition. There was a period when it became incredibly déclassé to order anything just for yourself. And that’s before you even start to think about the all-inclusive buffet, beloved of cruises and weddings, where it is far cheaper and easier to feed large numbers of people with large sharing dishes than individually. Meanwhile, the rise of the gastropub over the past three decades has forced the realisation that formality – far from being the whole point of dinner – makes most of us feel awkward. Steadily, food tended towards a more family‑table style, large shared dishes where you served yourself. It’s not quite so much of a hygiene faux pas as tapas, so long as you use the designated spoon, but it doesn’t feel quite as safe as having your own plate and sticking to it. In short: we’ve all got quite a handbrake turn to perform, with the obvious rider that this is the least of our problems.
76	Early on Thursday morning Mark Fahey received a call that hit him “right between the eyes”. His mother, 76-year-old Ann Fahey, had been found collapsed on the floor of her room at the Newmarch House aged-care home in Penrith, in Sydney’s west, where she is a resident. Nurses feared she’d fallen out of bed, but when he spoke to her on the phone Ann told Fahey that after waking during the night she’d felt tired and dizzy and had laid down on the floor. “She had a 38.9 degree temperature so she was a bit off with the fairies, but all she kept saying was that she was tired,” he told the Guardian. “She just wanted to get off the phone and sleep.” By early afternoon staff confirmed what he’d feared: more than a month after the aged-care home went into lockdown and after two previous tests came back negative, his mother was one of three new confirmed cases of Covid-19 recorded at Newmarch. “I don’t understand. She was a model patient, did everything right, she’s shut herself in her room the entire time,” Fahey said. “There’s shitloads going through my mind. Why is it still happening? … How can they still be getting new cases after this long. I mean it’s not rocket science. It’s coming in from the outside because she’s been meticulous following all their guidelines.” The Covid-19 outbreak at Newmarch House, which has so far claimed the lives of 13 residents and threatens to overtake the Ruby Princess as Australia’s deadliest wave of the virus, began when a part-time carer worked six shifts while symptomatic and infectious. Newmarch had already been in a type of lockdown before then. On 18 March the national cabinet announced rules placing strict limitations on the number of visitors allowed inside aged-care homes. The rules meant visits were limited to two adult visitors at once a day inside a resident’s room. But when the staff member returned a positive diagnosis for Covid-19 on 11 April after being told she had come into contact with a confirmed case, a flood of cases within the home were quickly discovered. On 12 April the first resident returned a positive result for the virus. Six days later a 93-year-old man became the first to die. Despite efforts to isolate every resident and the federal government’s introduction of surge workers from a private company, Aspen Medical, to help contain the outbreak, infections have risen steadily. There are now 61 confirmed cases of Covid-19 related to Newmarch House, including 24 staff and 37 residents. On Wednesday a 74-year-old man became the 13th resident to die and on Saturday, two further staff members tested positive. New South Wales health officials have said the staff member who first became infected had experienced only extremely mild symptoms before testing positive, and the state’s chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, told media the woman was “mortified” when she discovered she had the virus. In any case, the spiralling death toll inside the aged care home has left the families of some residents furious with Newmarch’s operator, Anglicare. Families have been gathering outside the facility to hold a vigil every afternoon, with some lucky enough to catch a glimpse of their relative through a window. This week, a group of family members published an open letter to Anglicare’s chief executive, Grant Millard, saying communication from within the home had been “far from satisfactory”. “Phones went unanswered day after day. Calls were not returned. Details about our individual loved ones were not provided regularly,” the letter read. “The residents were reporting that the care was inadequate and they were becoming distressed. Many of them were sick and frightened and did not have regular access to their family on the outside which increased their levels of anxiety as well as ours.” Some family members say Anglicare has improved its communication. After the NSW opposition leader, Jodi McKay, held a press conference outside the home on Wednesday, Louise Payne, who has led much of the campaign to improve communication with families, said she’d received a phone call from Millard and been able to have a window visit with her mother. “It was wonderful. It sounds such a little thing but I was absolutely elated because it’s been two weeks of hell not knowing how she is,” she said. “There are no guarantees, but it’s looking like mum might be one of the ones to beat this. She’s nearly 90, so if she does it’s amazing.” Others, however, are losing patience. Elizabeth Lane, from Windsor, in Sydney’s west, takes comfort in knowing her mother, Rose Davies, 84, is still making life hard for the nurses in Newmarch. “Mum’s always been a very difficult individual, so when they say she’s being a bit of a handful I think: ‘Thank god, she’s still OK.’ If they told me she was being nice and cooperative I’d know something was wrong,” she said. Davies lives in the palliative wing of Newmarch, and suffers from dementia. She has not tested positive for Covid-19, but Lane’s voice cracks as she talks about the toll more than a month without seeing her family is taking on her mother. “It’s heartbreaking to think this is how she’s going to end her days,” she said. “I know this is horrible for everyone. People have already lost their family, but I can’t help thinking we may have lost our parents too. By the time we get to speak to them again, they’re not going to know who we are. For dementia patients having no contact, no stimulation, it all exacerbates their decline.” Lane said that when the outbreak occurred, she “naively” trusted that Anglicare would manage to “get on top of this”. But as the weeks have passed, her patience with the lack of communication from the home has worn out. When the aged-care home provided mobile phones for residents, Lane said she discovered her mother’s hadn’t been set up for her. A number she had been calling in the nurse’s station for updates was abruptly disconnected with no warning. “I’ve got six or seven numbers that I just call over and over until someone answers,” she said. She was finally able to see her mother through a window on Friday, but only after she contacted the federal minister for aged care, Richard Colbeck. “He called me and said he’d sort it out for me,” she said. “I don’t blame the staff, this has been an absolute shitstorm, there’s no better word for it. The whole world has had trouble dealing with it. But I just think there hasn’t been a real emergency plan in place and everything feels really reactive, even now.” Matthew Fowler, whose father Lionel has so far tested negative to Covid-19 twice, says he has been frustrated at Anglicare’s management of the situation. “It’s absolutely appalling that a worker who was sick was allowed to work six shifts there.” On Friday, he joined the daily vigil outside the home, and said he was glad to see Anglicare had placed a senior chaplain for gathering family for the first time. “It should have happened from the first day.” As federal and state governments coordinate local health districts and surge staffing assistance to Newmarch, health authorities are struggling to understand how the virus is still spreading inside the heavily controlled facility. In a statement, Anglicare said the new infections had occurred “despite us having strict procedures and enforced infection control practices in place”. “These new cases may reflect historical transmissions and reflect the rigorous and ongoing testing at Newmarch House. We will be investigating further how this has occurred,” the statement read. On Friday, when unveiling a national code for aged-care facility visitation, Colbeck said the government’s assistance to Newmarch meant it was “effectively running a mini-hospital within the facility”, but did not criticise Anglicare for its response to the situation. “There has been no limit on the resources made available to Newmarch in managing this,” he said. “This is not a finger-pointing or a blame exercise, it’s a very, very unfortunate circumstance where somebody who was asymptomatic, but obviously had a very high viral load, was in contact with people for six days, residents and staff, and this is the very, very tragic outcome of that.” On Saturday, Chant announced a further infection control review of Newmarch launched after a wave of infections this week had shown breaches of safety protocol “amongst particularly the staff”. “And that’s obviously a concern. There have been some elements where consistent application of infection control practice has not occurred,” Chant said. For the family of some residents, the situation is become increasingly desperate. “I sort of lost my temper with it all the other night a bit. I just think, can’t they bring the army in, get them all out of this toxic cesspit and take them somewhere else,” Mark Fahey said. “You only get one mum. As soon as I found out, my first instinct is just to go and get her, but you can’t get into the joint. It’s the worst place in Australia to be unfortunately, and I can’t get her out.”
77	A series of rearranged Classic trials and Pattern races have been scheduled for the last two weekends in May if racing is allowed to resume later this month, as the British Horseracing Authority seeks to rescue as much of the Flat season as possible once the current lockdown is eased. The schedule, drawn up by members of the Flat Pattern Committee, would see the Greenham Stakes and Craven Stakes, two major trials for the 2,000 Guineas, taking place on different days over the weekend of 23-24 May. The Nell Gwyn Stakes and Fred Darling Stakes, trials for the 1,000 Guineas, would be staged the same weekend, along with five more Group Three events including the Brigadier Gerard Stakes and the Sagaro Stakes, a trial for the Ascot Gold Cup. The weekend of 30-31 May, meanwhile, would include the Lockinge Stakes, the first Group One of the season, along with the Group Two Yorkshire Cup, and the Dante Stakes, the most significant domestic trial for the Derby. The 2,000 Guineas and 1,000 Guineas would then be run on the weekend of 6-7 June, along with the Group One Coronation Cup, which would normally be part of that weekend’s Derby Festival at Epsom. If the BHA is able to proceed with this “best-case” scenario, Royal Ascot would remain in its traditional position in mid-June, starting on 16 June, with the Derby and Oaks being staged in early July. Sunday’s tips by Chris Cook Those of us who are still learning about Hong Kong racing will be interested in the extent to which team tactics form a part of the action there, which should become clear in the running of Sunday morning’s Queen Mother Memorial Cup. Tony Cruz will saddle the likely favourite, Helene Leadingstar (6.30), whose four opponents are all from the John Moore stable. Helene Leadingstar (6.30) is the “now” horse, having finally got his first two wins in Hong Kong after a couple of years’ trying. This step up to a mile and a half must help a horse who won the South Australia Derby in 2018, when known as Leicester. Sunday morning’s card will be shown live on Sky Sports Racing. 5.30 This “Griffin” race, featuring horses that had not competed before arriving in Hong Kong, has almost exactly the same cast as one that took place three weeks ago. Smiling Face was fancied that day but reared up in the stalls. Runner-up to a useful-looking rival, the horse has hardly anything in hand over Chancheng Prince or Sea Monarch on that showing but that loss of composure may have cost him. If he behaves better on this second outing, he can justify the faith shown by punters that day. 6.00 Demons Rock seems likely to be a short price for a horse that hasn’t won since he was a two-year-old entire with Tom Dascombe in the summer of 2017. A compelling case is hard to make for any of these but Fairy Floss could be worth chancing, since his only previous start on dirt was also the closest he has come to success. 7.00 It has taken time but Fabulous Eight now looks like making good on the promise he showed in late 2018. His third place last month was easily his best effort since then and he can be marked up a bit, having twice met trouble in running. From an in-form stable and with João Moreira aboard, he is sure to be a warm order. 7.30 Others have more obvious claims but there was a lot to like about Mig Energy’s fifth place at Happy Valley just over a fortnight ago. He wasn’t beaten far that day after chasing too hot a pace, while the pair who forced it finished out the back. Hopefully a wide draw means he will avoid getting drawn into an early pace battle and, if so, he has the talent to get involved. 8.00 The tactically versatile Excel Delight is perhaps best suited by creeping into contention, which was how he scored here in February. He nearly pulled off the same trick a fortnight ago when beaten by inches by a classy young rival and will be unlucky to find something of similar talent in this field. 8.35 This drop in class is interesting for Monster Kaka, who has dropped 20lb since starting in Hong Kong a year ago and now looks well treated and ready to win. He was a major eye-catcher when storming into third place a fortnight ago and the extra furlong should help. The lightly raced Snow Airjet may also be worth a second look. 9.05 Rather like his days with James Fanshawe, Enzemble has taken time to put it all together in Hong Kong but he won with a degree of authority when last seen. This belated return to 10 furlongs must be a help to him and he can see off Defining Moment, who has been helped by the visor but now makes a step up in class. 9.35 Party Genius is an obvious chance, but he’ll be a short price and is drawn wide again. Spicy Grill should be available at much bigger odds but is also going the right way and was beaten less than four lengths three weeks ago, after traffic problems. That was easily the best of his four runs and his first attempt at this trip. He should have more to offer. 10.10 Some interest in Good For You seems likely but Elite Patch appeals most, having won a couple of times in this grade in early winter before a step up in class made life tougher. 10.45 The cheekpieces have helped Everyone’s Joy, who gradually worked his way into form before running down a hot favourite here last month. Chad Schofield keeps the ride and they set the standard, with a handy inside draw.

81	The new-wave pop singer Cristina has reportedly died at age 61 after being diagnosed with coronavirus. The singer, whose full name was Cristina Monet-Zilkha, is believed to have died of complications from Covid-19, according to reports from various music channels and those close to the musician. Fans flooded the singer’s Instagram account with comments, expressing their grief. Cristina is known for dance-pop tunes such as Things Fall Apart, Disco Clone and a cover of Peggy Lee’s Is That All There Is? that were emblematic of the 1980s underground New York scene. She enjoyed brief success through club hits co-written with her husband, Ze Records label owner Michael Zilkha, before the two retired from music and moved to Texas in 1985. After her divorce in 1990, she returned to New York and wrote a number of music essays. In a Facebook post, Steve Wasserman, a UC Berkeley professor and friend of the late singer, said Cristina posted to social media that she was experiencing a high fever, but “her lungs were clear” and she appeared to be recovering. “Then, with appalling swiftness, she was gone this morning,” Wasserman wrote. Singer Zola Jesus paid tribute on Twitter, calling her a “HUGE inspiration” and praising her for being “too weird for the pop world and too pop for the weird world”. Notable names in music who have died from the virus include singer Alan Merrill, the songwriter behind I Love Rock’n’Roll, and country musician Joe Diffie.
82	“Hey, if something happens to you, who pays the mortgage?” asks my eldest child, recently capable of making his own lunch. “We split it equally”, offers the conscientious middle child. “There will always be someone to help you,” I lightly reply before leaving for work, casually wondering whether this will be the day I meet the coronavirus. In ordinary times, being a doctor is a matter of privilege and pride. I’d like to think that I give generously, mindful that one day I will lean on others. But my risks have just multiplied. “Did they teach you this in medical school?” someone asks. No. I don’t think that anyone predicted that the entire world would be struck down by the same incurable infection at the same time. We go to sleep believing one thing and awake knowing another. The rolling redundancies are devastating. The ranks of the disenfranchised will swell. Mental illness is spiking. Worryingly, so is domestic violence. Each day, I walk in to the wards, still filling with patients. Of course, being negative for the newest disease doesn’t mean everything is fine – patients still have their “old” problems – organ failure, cancer, dementia and falls. In a situation where we don’t know when a patient can return for follow-up, every decision must be doubly deliberate. Later, I attend my oncology clinic. Urban doctors like me are new to telehealth. Many patients are elderly, not fluent in English and not internet-savvy. If I can manage to reassure them and not invoke more fear, it’s a godsend. Once clinic ends, we move to long-term planning, deciding how to treat all our patients safely and fairly. Cancer is onerous at the best of times; now, there are additional layers of complexity. As others stay home, doctors and nurses, cleaners, theatre techs and secretaries are coming to work. Our car parks are full. And yet, there’s not even a whisper of self-congratulation – we’re simply doing what we undertook. I am touched by the number of offers of help. Fortunately, I don’t need supplies, rent assistance or a job. But if I may, here is something you can do. Please stop constantly second-guessing and ridiculing the Australian government officials, health authorities, and public health experts at the forefront of managing this unprecedented crisis. Self-appointed experts have thrust themselves everywhere, declaring outrage at every step, criticising the advice of the chief medical officer, his deputies and anyone whose view they disagree with. From testing criteria to elective surgery, from protective gear to unproven therapies, a cacophony of voices is drowning out authoritative advice. “Authoritative” may be an exaggeration in swiftly changing times and a democratic society should welcome debate rather than a slavish adherence to rules but the truth is when we are all unsure, it is important to let people do what they are trained to do but hold them accountable. Global experience tells us that there is no single formula for diverse nations. I have clinical acumen but it’s no use pretending that I have any real public health expertise or insight into the levers of government. What works for my patient won’t help the population. From the comforts of Melbourne, I can’t posit what should happen in Darwin, much less Manhattan or Mumbai – and I suspect it’s the same for most of us. So, in the midst of so much noise, I need a clear space to listen to local experts who not only have access to the data but also the capacity to integrate rapidly multiple moving pieces. These people have training in infectious diseases, public health, epidemiology, statistics, economics and government and are working day and night for the common good. I decline to vilify them or lampoon their decisions and I hope you will too. In 2004, I was a disaster-relief physician in the tsunami-ravaged Maldives and witnessed the difficulties of coordinating a mass medical effort. The world poured in billions of dollars in aid. Unlike today, the threat had passed, only recovery mattered. On an island without a hospital, I needed oral antibiotics, asthma inhalers and pain relief. Instead, I got anaesthetic, a desalination plant and mouldy bread. The best intentions are useless in the absence of cool, considered minds. Another reason to trust the experts. For many of my colleagues, staying calm is becoming decidedly harder in the face of constant messages being generated by highly anxious individuals fuelling our worst fears. Let’s face it, we are all watching this pandemic with disbelief. But blaming and emotive commentaries shared on personal and professional groups, with an “intent to vent”, or “simply discuss” have very real consequences – they rattle even the most stoic and steady professionals. This week, I need to focus on the children in quarantine while their mother is dying. And the patient whose cancer is progressing. And the man who can’t give his beloved wife a funeral. I want to protect my interns who aren’t sleeping well through this baptism of fire. But I have limited bandwidth and the more time I spend distinguishing real concern from confected outrage, the less time there is for the things that really matter. Universal healthcare isn’t perfect but is again revealing its strengths. A central command structure is cutting through the noise and delivering the most up-to-date, evidence-based information. Our public hospitals are working non-stop to keep up with change. In swiftly changing times, we must excuse our leaders the occasional stumble but realise the gift of calm and consistent leadership. So no matter who you are, please take a minute to ask yourself how your next private or public post or media commentary will add value to the societal response to the pandemic. How will it encourage people to play their part? Will it tell us anything new? Could someone already be working on your concern? This is not a call to muzzle debate but a plea that outrage always travels faster than methodical thinking. Anxiety is absolutely reasonable but if we are honest, we must own our anxiety, not spread it. Opinion should not be disguised as expert advice. It isn’t merely irresponsible; it can do harm. The greater your audience, the greater your responsibility. From my vantage point, the future is unclear but the navigation is reliable. Speaking to doctors around the world, this in itself is no mean feat. There will be another time to reflect on whether the government and health experts got things right and use those learnings to inform the next response. Until then, letting them get on with their job is the most important thing you can do to help me do mine. • Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

83	Since Sunday evening, when Scott Morrison announced strict new social distancing measures and a limit to public gatherings to two people, state and territories around Australia have introduced their own rules, fines and even jail sentences to deal with people breaking the rules. Some of the rules are unclear and the different penalties for each state and territory makes some of the new infringements confusing. While police commissioners have said they will use discretion in issuing fines, there are reports of people being stopped by police for undertaking activities – such as buying takeaway coffee – that appear to be allowed. We’d like to hear from people about their experiences dealing with police on the new social distancing measures in all states and territories. Share your experiences Have you been stopped by officers or had any interaction with police while going about your day since the new rules were introduced?

84	The NSW government may use a military-style operation to test all cruise ship crew members currently off the coast of Sydney and Wollongong in an attempt to end a maritime standoff involving multiple ships which were ordered to leave Australian waters by police. “You could imagine, you know, dropping doctors, specialists across eight ships, 9,000 people, you know, it’s a big task in itself,” NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said. “Anyone who requires urgent medical attention, we bring off and put into our hospital system.” Fuller said he feared the NSW health system did not have the capacity to bring all 9,000 crew onto land, especially as many of the cruise ships have seen Covid-19 outbreaks. “My fear is, by bringing 9,000 people off the cruise ships into isolation, not knowing if they have the virus or they may develop symptoms, that would absolutely overload our hospital system and everything that we have done to this point would be for nothing.” Little is known about the state of health of the crew members on more than a dozen large cruise ships just off Australia’s coast. Most have a crew of more than 1,000 who often live in close quarters below decks. At least a dozen people have already been brought to shore off these ships requiring urgent medical attention. The NSW government hopes that after this medical work is done, these vessels will return to their ports of origin. “A ship left two nights ago, and there’s information that over the next couple of nights another couple of ships will refuel and restock and go back to their original port, or their port of origin. So, we are chipping away,” Fuller said. The International Transport Workers’ Federation wants the Australian government to allow the thousands of crew members on the ships to be disembarked and flown home to their countries of residence amid fears the vessels will become humanitarian disasters if coronavirus takes hold aboard. In the case of the Ruby Princess, which was sitting off Botany Bay, six crew had already had to be medically evacuated. The ship has been linked to more than 400 cases among passengers who disembarked on 19 March and 8 March in Sydney. The ship, registered in the Bahamas, had 1,100 crew members still on board. “We call on governments to repatriate crew members to their countries, leaving only crew for maritime operations, and the cruise lines should pay for it,” said Dean Summers, the national coordinator for the International Transport Workers’ Federation in Australia. “This is an emerging humanitarian catastrophe,” he said. “I feel sympathy for the passengers, but crew are living in much more dangerous conditions,” he said. At least 18 foreign-registered ships were docked or floating in Australian waters, with an approximate total of 15,000 crew on board. In New South Wales, the Voyager of the Seas and Celebrity Solstice, with approximately 1,200 crew each, were docked at Port Kembla near Wollongong, while the Radiance of the Seas (894 crew), Ovation of the Seas (1,500 crew), Spectrum of the Seas (1,551 crew) and Carnival Splendour (1,150 crew) were off the coast. As of Wednesday, six crew members from the Radiance of the Seas had been brought ashore to hospital, and there had been 79 confirmed cases of coronavirus linked to the Ovation of the Seas. In Sydney, the Pacific Explorer was docked at the White Bay cruise terminal, while the Ruby Princess was off the coast. In Queensland, the Sun Princess (924 crew), was heading to Gladstone, according to ship tracking site Marine Traffic. The Carnival Spirit (930 crew) was off the coast of Brisbane, while the Sea Princess (910 crew), Azamara Journey (408 crew) and Pacific Dawn were all floating off the Sunshine Coast. The Queen Elizabeth cruise ship, with 1,005 crew, was docked in Gladstone. In Western Australia, the Artania cruise ship and its 450 crew refused to leave on Wednesday, after 29 Australian passengers on board tested positive for Covid-19 and were taken to hospital. The state’s premier, Mark McGowan, said he believed “the federal government needs to step up here … I just urge [them] to resolve the situation as soon as possible”. The world’s largest private residential ship, The World, was off the coast of Fremantle with 280 crew. The Golden Princess (1,100 crew) and Viking Orion were docked in Melbourne, and the Pacific Aria (602 crew) was docked in Adelaide. Most of the ships were sailing under flags of convenience from Caribbean countries, but Summers said this was done to avail the cruise lines of tax havens and to avoid first world employment conditions and wages. He said if the cruise ships returned to the ports they were flagged to, they would not even have berths for them. In what is developing into a legal quagmire, the NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, ordered the six ships off the coast of NSW to return to their port of origin, but they remained offshore. The NSW Port Authority has been permitting cruise ships to refuel and take on food, and the Radiance of the Seas and Carnival Sprit departed Port Kembla this morning. The maritime law expert John Kavanagh from Pacific Maritime said Australia had an economic zone stretching 200 miles offshore; and a 12 mile zone that is considered to be part of the nation. In between was the contiguous zone between 12 and 24 miles which allowed coastal nations to police bad behaviour such as drug smuggling and pollution. But Kavanagh said there was also an exception of “innocent passage”, which allowed ships “as of right” to navigate through these zones. He said there were also obligations on Australia under international treaties, adopted by the Navigation Act, which imposed a duty to render assistance to ships in distress. Summers said a declaration of distress would trigger obligations for Australian governments, although he noted that when the MV Tampa, having picked up 433 asylum seekers from waters off the north-west coast of Australia sought the right to bring them to Australian waters, the Howard government refused. “We rescue millionaire yachtsmen at great cost, so we should honour our obligations,” he said. A number of the cruise ships currently offshore claim Australian ports as their ‘home ports’ and operate in the Pacific, but they pay no Australian tax and employ few Australians. “The concept of ‘home port’ is simply an arcane rule and doesn’t mean anything. It’s the flag which determines what law applies,” Kavanagh said. In a bid to avoid a repeat of the the Ruby Princess fiasco of two weeks ago, the federal and state governments set up a task force, with the department of foreign affairs and the NSW police commissioner as the decision makers. On 28 March, the NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, signed an order that means no one can leave these cruise ships, including Australian citizens, without the permission of the police commissioner. “Allowances will be made to allow ships to reprovision, and cargo ships can continue to dock but no one can leave them without the police commissioner’s express permission,” a spokesman for the NSW police said. Earlier in the week, the commissioner said: “They don’t pay taxes in Australia, they don’t park their boats in Australia, their primary flags are often in the Caribbean in different islands. [It’s] time to go home.” On Tuesday, a spokeswoman for Royal Caribbean – which operates the Radiance of the Seas, Voyager of the Seas, Ovation of the Seas and Spectrum of the Seas – said that the ships were “in the process of leaving Australia”. “All scheduled passenger disembarkations in Australia have been completed and cruising operations suspended,” she said, citing a statement from Cruise Lines International Association Australasia. “This leaves a number of out-of-service ships, either at berth or at anchor, or in the process of leaving Australia. “Cruise lines are now focused on the arrangements to repatriate crew to their homes and families, and preparing their ships to be laid up with skeleton crew for the duration they are out-of-service. “Cruise lines are working with the federal government on approvals for out-of-service ships that are home-ported in Australia to remain here, while it is planned that the rest of the ships will leave Australia as soon as practicably possible.”
85	Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: WHO director ‘deeply concerned’ as deaths double in a week Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was “deeply concerned about the rapid escalation and global spread of infection”, adding: “Over the past five weeks, we have witnessed a near-exponential growth in the number of new cases reaching almost every country, territory and area. “The number of deaths has more than doubled in the past week. In the next few days, we will reach one million confirmed cases and 50,000 deaths.” Known global cases surge past 900,000 mark According to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, at least 932,605 people have now been infected around the world, though suspected underreporting by various countries means the figure is likely to be significantly higher. The researchers have counted at least 46,809 deaths, while they say 193,177 people have recovered. UK government faces criticism over strategy British newspapers, including those normally supportive of the Conservatives, lambasted the Tory government over shortages of equipment as it emerged that just 2,000 of half a million frontline National Health Service staff had been tested. Ministers have been coming under increasing pressure to explain their plans and the Guardian detailed the unravelling of the government’s initial testing strategy – and the valuable time it wasted. Cop26 climate talks are suspended A key UN climate summit that was due to take place in Glasgow in November has been postponed until 2021. “The world is currently facing an unprecedented global challenge and countries are rightly focusing their efforts on saving lives and fighting Covid-19,” organisers said. Activists acknowledged that the move was necessary, but urged governments not to forget the climate crisis even as they deal with the pandemic. French death toll passes 4,000 France becomes the fourth country to pass the 4,000 threshold, following Italy, Spain and the US. The daily government tally accounts only for those dying in hospitals, but authorities say they will soon be able to compile data on deaths in retirement homes, which is likely to result in a big increase in registered fatalities. The current total is 4,032 people. UK to call up 3,000 army reservists The personnel will be assigned to help with the UK’s pandemic response, bringing the strength of the armed forces’ virus response to about 23,000. They will be needed to help with medical and logistical support for the NHS and to act as liaison officers, among other things. No one working for the National Health Service or delivering frontline services will be mobilised, officials say. US personal protective equipment stocks nearly exhausted – Trump The US president says the federal stockpile of personal protective equipment is nearly empty, “because we’re sending it directly to hospitals”. Earlier, CNN reported that the “Strategic National Stockpile is deploying the last round of shipments in its inventory, depleting the bulk of its protective gear”. US intelligence accuses China of playing down crisis American officials reportedly believe China has been underreporting the total number of cases and deaths. The conclusions of a classified report from the intelligence community to the White House were revealed to Bloomberg by three anonymous officials who declined to give details about its contents. They reportedly say the thrust was that China’s concealment was deliberate and that the report was received by the White House last week. Germany extends distancing measures Physical distancing measures have been extended in Germany until at least 19 April and will be re-evaluated on the Tuesday after Easter, Angela Merkel has said. The German chancellor spoke after a telephone conference with the premiers of Germany’s 16 states on Wednesday afternoon, in which they agreed a draft resolution urging people “to keep contact with people beyond their own household to an absolute minimum, even during the Easter holidays, in accordance with the applicable rules”, according to German media cited by the broadcaster Deutsche Welle. Growth in Italy’s death toll slows Another 727 people have died in Italy, taking the total to 13,155. That represents the smallest increase since 26 March. Nevertheless, figures from the Civil Protection Agency show that the number of new cases rose more sharply than a few days earlier, growing by 4,782 compared with 4,053. Lockdown measures in the country are to be extended to 13 April, the health minister, Roberto Speranza, has said. He told the Senate on Wednesday: “We must not confuse the first positive signals with an ‘all clear’ signal. Data shows that we are on the right path and that the drastic decisions are bearing fruit.”
86	Business leaders have warned that British companies are running out of time to stay afloat amid the coronavirus outbreak, after a survey showed a majority of firms had just three months of cash or less in reserve. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said companies across the country were suffering from a sharp and significant fall in domestic and overseas sales as lockdown measures brought many firms close to collapse, threatening widespread job losses. In a survey of about 600 BCC members, 62% warned they had no more than three months of cash left to cover running costs. Conducted in the final days of March when Britain entered lockdown, the BCC warned the findings of the survey were expected to worsen over coming weeks. Almost 1m small businesses across Britain are feared to be at risk of collapsing within the next month as they struggle to secure emergency cash, despite the government’s efforts to cushion the economic blow and the Bank of England lowering interest rates to provide cheap financing. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has pledged unprecedented aid, including tax holidays, loan guarantees and paying workers’ wages. However, businesses and MPs have raised concerns that there are gaps in the schemes. Mervyn King, speaking at a webinar organised by the Policy Exchange thinktank, said banks needed to stay open in order to help their customers cope with the economic impact of the Covid-19 crisis. “It is surprising that most bank branches are closed,” the former Bank of England governor said, adding that the reason the banks had been bailed out in 2008 was because of their important role in stabilising the economy. “Banks need to be there to talk to customers and to make sure the loans to businesses are there.” Lord King added: “Banks need to give clear instructions to their staff. They are part of the essential system that keeps the economy going. Supermarkets make their customers queue outside and allow only a limited number of people in at any one time. I can’t see why the banks should not be open if they abide by the same restrictions.” Adam Marshall, the director general of the BCC, said the pandemic had taken a heavy toll on business and economic activity across the UK. He urged the government to speed up its response to the crisis to avoid further unnecessary damage. “While businesses have welcomed the unprecedented size and scope of the government support packages, our findings highlight the urgent need for that support to reach businesses on the ground as soon as possible. The majority of firms cannot wait weeks or months for help to arrive,” he said. Following the government’s pledge to cover 80% of a worker’s pay packet up to £2,500 a month, the BCC said a third of survey respondents planned to furlough between 75% and100% of their workforce over the following week. Several companies have announced plans. The no-frills chain Poundland is to mothball about one in 10 stores and lay off 250 head office staff, while Whitbread, the owner of the Premier Inn hotel chain and restaurants including Beefeater and Brewers Fayre, has said it would put some employees on a furlough while its sites remained closed. Torsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said the scale of unemployment in Britain would be “unimaginable” if the government had not agreed to subsidise wages. “This survey shows just how swift the impact of this economic crisis is being felt by firms and workers,” he added. Baker’s dilemma April would usually herald the start of the year’s busiest trading period for Becca Luger’s cake company, Crumpet Cakes. In her decade running the business, she has moved into selling her home-baked cakes and biscuits at large shows, festivals and events in her hometown of Bristol and around the south-west. Restrictions on gatherings of people, in order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, has led to cancellation of about 25 events where Luger was due to sell her products between April and June, leaving her without any income. “I am very event-based, and if by August or September we are still in a state of lockdown that’s most of my trading year gone, so what have I got left? It is very bleak for a lot of businesses,” Luger said. Like many businesses surveyed by the BCC, the cake company owner believes she has a little more than a month’s cash available to keep her business running. Luger had hoped to apply for government help, but believes she falls between several support schemes. She runs her business from a unit in a shared workspace and contributes her share of the business rates for the building, which is classed as a warehouse and therefore not eligible for rent relief. As a one-person limited company, Luger believes she doesn’t qualify for the government’s self-employment package. She is considering whether she should furlough herself and claim 80% of the small salary she usually pays herself, but warned: “It will take several years to recover from this, if there is a business to go back to.”
87	Touching newly discovered letters written by Thomas Hardy’s second wife reveal her joy at their union and, later, her sadness at life without the great author after his death – but also highlight the media pressure the celebrity couple faced more than a century ago. In a letter written shortly after their wedding, Florence Dugdale portrayed Hardy as “one of the kindest, most humane men in the world” while acknowledging that his fame led to the constant attention of the press in the UK and US. A letter sent after Hardy’s death includes a vivid image of her sitting in the room where she first met her late husband, a French bulldog snoring by the fire as her only companion. Hardy’s first marriage – to Emma Gifford – has tended to garner more attention, partly because so much of his great work, including the elegiac “Poems of 1912-13”, was inspired by her. Academics believe the three recently found letters are significant because they offer fresh insight into his relationship with Florence, a teacher and author, in his later years. The first letter was sent by Florence from Max Gate, Hardy’s home on the outskirts of Dorchester in Dorset on 10 February 1914 to a former pupil of hers called Harold Barlow, who was away working in Africa. Florence wrote: “Perhaps you have read, if you have the English papers, that I am now the proud and very happy wife of the greatest living English writer – Thomas Hardy. “Although he is much older than myself, it is a genuine love match – on my part, at least, for I suppose I ought not to speak for him. At any rate I know I have for a husband one of the kindest, most humane men in the world.” Florence also wrote about how she was weary of celebrity culture and the media: “Accounts of me &amp; my portrait have been printed in every paper, I think, in England. I have been shown in the Cinematograph, written about all over America &amp; Europe. I am tired of this publicity.” The letters were kept by Barlow’s daughter, Josephine Barlow, and found after her death by his grandsons, Ian and Colin Nicol. The letters have been passed to Prof Angelique Richardson, of the University of Exeter, who is leading the Hardy’s Correspondents Project, as part of which letters connected to the author are being digitised. Richardson said: “It is rare to find such significant letters. They give an intimate glimpse into life at Max Gate and the loves and losses Florence shared with Hardy. It also shows us more about Florence, how self-deprecating she was and how devoted she was to her husband.” The second and third letters to Barlow were written 18 years later, in 1932, four years after Hardy’s death. She said: “I am writing this late in the evening alone, in the room where I first met my husband. A little French bull-dog is snoring by the fire – he is my faithful – &amp; generally my only – companion.” Florence added: “I thank you for your kind words of sympathy about my great loss. It was such a wonderful thing to live in close association with that great mind &amp; that noble personality. After having lived 14 years with such a companion it is little wonder that I feel intolerably lonely – &amp; find the world very empty.” Harold’s 16-year-old daughter, Josephine, wrote movingly to Florence, in 1947, full of admiration for Hardy. But the letter arrived 10 years after Florence’s death and was returned to the sender. The words: “house emty” [sic] can be seen on the envelope written by a postal worker. The letters will be placed with the rest of Dorset Museum’s Hardy Collection.
88	Millions of people across Britain risk falling through gaps in the coronavirus wage subsidy plan and benefits system, according to two of the country’s leading economics thinktanks. After ministers hurriedly pulled together plans to increase the level of financial aid available from the state as the Covid-19 outbreak intensifies, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said many self-employed workers would still get no support, while others would be left financially better off as a result of the crisis. The Resolution Foundation thinktank also called on the chancellor to expand the universal credit benefits system to support more households. Highlighting sizeable gaps in the government plan to pay 80% of employees’ salaries and self-employed workers’ profits as the crisis mounts, the IFS warns that 2 million people who work for themselves would not be protected because: they do not earn enough from self-employment to be eligible; earn more than the £50,000 threshold; or only started out working for themselves within the past year and therefore missing the threshold to prove their past income to receive wage subsidies. A further 2 million more people who run their own company will also slip through gaps in the safety net deployed last week by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, because they pay themselves much of their income in dividends, and less through a salary. A salary can be paid partially by the government, while dividends are excluded. Offering an early glimpse of the divergent impact the coronavirus crisis will have for various groups in society, the IFS says a quarter of self-employed people will be financially better off than they otherwise would have been, even if their business is forced to shut down completely. This can happen if benefits income outweighs the 20% of lost earnings that are not covered by the state. It says many of the self-employed whose incomes dry up will be able to receive universal credit now and 80% of their historical earnings for three months at the start of June. As these subsidies will also be based on past earnings, they could also be left financially better off. However, workers who lose their job completely will not be helped by the schemes as more companies across Britain consider slashing jobs in response to the crisis, the IFS warns, while those who have to take unpaid leave to cover caring responsibilities, or who face a cut in their earnings but continue to work, could also be left worse off. Although warning the measures are not as well targeted as would be expected in normal times, given the rapid onset of the crisis and the need to rush out support packages, the IFS says the average self-employed person and company employees would be better off than if the package had not been drawn up. If employees are furloughed they will lose about only 12% of net family income, compared with 53% before the rescue measures. An average self-employed individual will lose about 14% of family income, compared with 44% before the changes were announced. Stuart Adam, a senior research economist at the IFS, said: “Under pressure to come up with a workable scheme to support the self-employed at speed, the chancellor has erred on the side of generosity for most. “But some will fall through the gaps completely – including high earners and the newly self-employed – and others will see only part of their overall earnings covered.” In a separate report, the Resolution Foundation has warned that some people will miss the receipt of benefits they could be eligible for. It also urges the government to help medium-income households by scrapping rules that lower the level of support for those with savings over £6,000 and rule out people with savings over £16,000. Sunak said last month he would inject a further £7bn into the benefits system, raising the value of universal credit by £1,000 this year. However, Karl Handscomb, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said the government needed to bolster universal credit further to ensure the benefit system was “battle ready” for the economic fallout of coronavirus. “The rollout of universal credit in recent years has been beset by controversy. But its performance over the next few months is the real test of this new benefit system, as it provides a living standards lifeline to millions of households.” he said.
89	A shortage of moderators who combat sexual abuse online combined with children spending more time on the internet at home has created a “perfect storm” for abusers to take advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic, one of the UK’s biggest safeguarding charities has warned. The warning from the NSPCC comes after Europol, the law enforcement agency of the European Union, said it had seen “increased online activity by those seeking child abuse material”. The charity said tech firms had had to scale back on the number of moderators tackling sexual abuse, giving offenders an “unprecedented opportunity” to target children who are spending more time online and are increasingly lonely or anxious because of the lockdown. Last month, Facebook’s founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said third-party US content moderators would be working from home and the company would increase its use of artificial intelligence to moderate content during the coronavirus crisis. The NSPCC said it was concerned that such workers would not be able to moderate the most harmful content from home because of data protection, and that there were concerns around the impact on their mental health of working from home. AI is normally used to identify and triage harmful content, grooming and abuse, but there may be fewer human moderators available to ensure swift action is taken when content is identified, the charity said. Andy Burrows, head of child safety online policy at the NSPCC, said: “The impact of the coronavirus lockdown has increased online risks and brewed a perfect storm for offenders to abuse children. “The public health emergency is creating major challenges across society, and like all of us, tech firms must adapt. It’s vital they set out how they are prioritising protecting children by identifying and disrupting offenders with fewer moderation resources available. “Social media and gaming sites are proving to be a lifeline for parents and their children as they adapt to being at home, but we must also recognise there are heightened risks. “It is more important than ever for parents to have regular conversations with their children about what they’re doing online and to reassure them they can come to you with any worries.” The closure of schools and nurseries has led to children spending much of their day online, including time spent on educational activity, contact with friends and entertainment, but the NSPCC warned that it could increase the risk of sexual abuse. The NSPCC called on tech firms to share with governments the volumes of referrals they make during the crisis to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in order to track and identify child abuse risks. The charity also urged companies to share intelligence with one another about emerging and evolving risks. The Internet Watch Foundation, the UK charity responsible for finding and removing from the internet videos and images of children suffering sexual abuse, said it was braced for a rise in public reports of child sexual abuse on the internet during the pandemic. The IWF assesses footage and images reported to its hotline. The organisation said hotline staff would continue to go into the office and it was functioning as normal. Susie Hargreaves, chief executive of the IWF, said: “More people alone in their homes and more people spending longer online sadly means we are likely to see more people stumbling across criminal material involving child sexual abuse on the internet. We are also expecting criminals to be more active on the internet during the coming months.” Last week, Europol’s executive director, Catherine de Bolle, told Politico that the agency had detected an increase in paedophile activity. “We have huge figures of people abusing child material online,” she said. “We receive different information from the member states that there is an increased online activity by paedophiles seeking exploitation material.”

91	We are closing the blog now but coverage will continue over here. Reuters: Police in the Chilean capital Santiago detained more than 50 protesters on Friday, saying they had violated rules intended to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Protesters gathered on the Labor Day holiday in Santiago’s central square, many shouting and displaying signs that railed against abuse of workers and a sharp rise in layoffs in the South American nation. Calls to protest on social media warned those who attended the rally to “use gloves, masks and alcohol gel,” but police said demonstrators had failed to adhere to a nationwide rule against gatherings of more than 50 people. The Carabineros police force said on Twitter that one of the protesters detained had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and was meant to be in isolation for another week. Police officers clad in plastic-screened helmets and olive uniforms herded protesters into police vehicles, while water cannons mounted on trucks nearby dispersed others. Santiago is under partial quarantine, but scattered, small protests against the government of center-right President Sebastian Pinera have persisted in areas not under lockdown. Hello, this is Helen Davidson taking over the live blog for the next little bit. Thanks to Kevin Rawlinson for his coverage over the last few hours. Here is our latest catch-up on recent developments. The top US health official Dr Anthony Fauci will be prevented from testifying to a congressional committee examining the Trump administration’s response to the pandemic next week, the White House has said. The Trump administration claimed it would be “counterproductive” to have individuals involved in the response testify. The White House spokesman Judd Deere told Reuters: While the Trump administration continues its whole-of-government response to Covid-19, including safely opening up America again and expediting vaccine development, it is counter-productive to have the very individuals involved in those efforts appearing at congressional hearings. We are committed to working with Congress to offer testimony at the appropriate time. Trump said after the KCNA report that he will have something to say about Kim at the appropriate time. There has been speculation about Kim’s health after he missed the birth anniversary celebrations of state founder Kim Il Sung on 15 April. The day is a major holiday in North Korea and Kim as leader usually pays a visit to the mausoleum where his grandfather lies in state. A source familiar with US intelligence analyses and reporting told Reuters they could not immediately confirm the KCNA report. The White House and State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. According to Reuters, the news of Kim Jong-un’s appearance in public is now also being reported by North Korean sources. The state news agency KCNA says he attended the completion of a fertiliser plant in a region north of the capital, Pyongyang, on Friday. It is the first report of his public activity since 11 April. According to KCNA, Kim cut a ribbon at the ceremony and those in attendance “burst into thunderous cheers of ‘hurrah!’ for the Supreme Leader who is commanding the all-people general march for accomplishing the great cause of prosperity”. Kim was accompanied by several senior North Korean officials, including his younger sister Kim Yo Jong, KCNA said. Reuters said it could not independently verify the report. The US president Donald Trump has offered an increasingly bleak picture for the US, telling a White House event: Hopefully, we’re going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost, which is a horrible number, nevertheless. Trump, who initially dismissed the outbreak as a “hoax”, has oscillated between claiming that a death toll of between 100,000 and 200,000 people would represent a success and predicting it could be as light as 60,000 or 70,000. According to the latest figures from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 62,406 people have died in the US since the outbreak began. The North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has made his first public appearance in nearly three weeks, according to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency. His absence amid the pandemic had been the cause of speculation, though South Korean and US officials had stressed their belief he was not ill and could simply have been sheltering from the pandemic. More than 70% of virus patients admitted to critical care are men, according to data from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC). The research was based on a sample of 7,542 critically-ill patients confirmed as having Covid-19. It showed 5,389 of the patients were men compared to 2,149 women. The report also found that men were more likely to die in critical care, with 51% dying in care compared to around 43% of women. In total about 49% of the 5,139 patients admitted to critical care who had recorded care outcomes had died, it found. The FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn was careful to note that remdesivir has not received FDA approval as a coronavirus treatment and has only been approved for emergency use on severely ill patients who have been hospitalised. FDA approval requires a much more lengthy review process, while an emergency use authorisation is issued more quickly after the agency weighs the potential risks and potential benefits of a treatment option to help address an emergency situation. Today’s action is an important step in our efforts to collaborate with innovators and researchers to provide sick patients timely access to new therapies where appropriate, while at the same time supporting research to further evaluate whether they are safe and effective. There’s tremendous interest among all parties to identify and arm ourselves with medicines to combat COVID-19, and through our Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program, the FDA is working around-the-clock and using every tool at our disposal to speed these efforts. More people stayed home in Brazil, Japan and Singapore in April as their numbers of cases surged, while people in the United States and Australia returned to parks and jobs as infection rates flattened, data from Google suggest. The latest weekly update of aggregated travel patterns Google collected from its users’ phones points to increased disobedience with lockdown orders in place since March but rising compliance with those issued last month. The US president Donald Trump has told reporters the drug remedesivir has been approved for emergency use to treat coronavirus patients. The FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn clarified that the drug had specifically been cleared for emergency use on those in hospital. The president said the approval represented a “very promising situation” and the White House’s taskforce coordinator Dr Deborah Birx added: “I think this really illustrates what can happen in such a short time.” The emergency approval comes days after Dr Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, expressed cautious optimism about the results of a remdesivir drug trial. The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery. What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus. Albania is relaxing some of its restrictions from Monday, its prime minister Edi Rama has said. It will enlarge its area of green zones and let taxis travel between cities. Then, from 11 May, it will allow shopping centres to open and cars to travel without permits. While still enforcing an afternoon-to-dawn curfew, Albania has eased its restrictions this week, letting many retailers open except for bars and restaurants, though they may offer deliveries. Some people wore masks, others did not. On 12 March, two weeks after Australia declared the coronavirus would become a pandemic and 47 days after the first case in Australia was detected in Melbourne, the World Health Organisation made it official. That night, in Melbourne, organisers of the Australian Grand Prix were scrambling to keep the event open despite an 11th hour order from Victoria’s chief health officer that they could run the race but had to turn spectators away. It would be the first major event in Australia to be cancelled by the coronavirus. Within 24 hours, almost every other flagship event planned for the next month would follow suit. This is the first 50 days of the shutdown. Yemen has reported its first case in Taiz governorate, raising the number of diagnosed infections to seven with two deaths in the war-torn country that lacks medical care. The United Nations says it fears the virus could be spreading undetected among an acutely malnourished population with inadequate testing capabilities. The national emergency coronavirus committee tweeted: A new confirmed case of coronavirus was reported, the first in (southwestern) governorate of Taiz, in a man in his 40s. Yemen recorded its first case in southern Hadharamout province on 10 April. On Wednesday, it announced five infections in the southern port of Aden, with two deaths. Hundreds of people have gathered in a Berlin square to mark May Day in defiance of the ban on public gatherings of more than 20, exposing deep frustrations with physical distancing rules. Reuters reports that police blocked roads around a square in Kreuzberg, traditionally the centre of left-wing May Day protests to prevent more people from joining what a police spokeswoman called an illegal gathering. Leftist groups had called for the demonstration to denounce capitalism and urge solidarity, especially with refugees seeking to reach Europe. They had urged participants to wear masks and stay at least 1.5 metres apart. “Saving lives is not a crime,” read a giant red banner dangled from a window, in a reference to the rescue ships saving refugees trying to reach Europe. Most of those gathered appeared to be keeping a safe distance from one another. Riot police watched from a distance as a police helicopter circled overhead. “We have prevented the parade from growing bigger and are using loudspeakers to urge people to disperse,” the police spokeswoman said, adding that the situation remained largely peaceful. An overwhelming majority of Germans back the lockdown enforced by the country’s 16 states and backed by the chancellor Angela Merkel, despite its heavy toll on the economy, which is expected to contract by a record of more than 6% this year. The World Health Organization (WHO) has reiterated that the virus is of natural origin after the US president’s uncorroborated claims he had seen evidence it originated in a Chinese lab, AFP reports. Scientists believe it jumped from animals to humans, emerging in China late last year, possibly from a market in Wuhan selling exotic animals for meat. Trump has refused to offer any details of or evidence for his claim that he has proof that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was actually the source of the outbreak. Asked about Trump’s claim during a virtual press conference, WHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan stressed that the UN health agency had “listened again and again to numerous scientists who have looked at the sequences” of the virus. “We are assured that this virus is natural in origin,” he said, reiterating a stance the UN agency has expressed previously. Varadkar’s widely expected announcement was made in a solemn address that channelled the Vera Lynn song We’ll Meet Again. Varadkar announced two tweaks to restrictions that are due to expire on 5 May: the 2km limit on exercise will extend to 5km and people aged over 70 who are cocooning will be allowed to exercise outdoors. I know it’s been difficult. The uncertainty about when things will get back to normal and the fear of the virus itself. As a nation, our physical health has been attacked, our mental health eroded. Our economy battered and our society put to the ultimate test. Restrictions were working and had saved thousands of lives but progress could be “swept away” with premature relaxation, he said. It will take some time for our lives to get back to normal. To a new normal. But it will happen. The reopening will have five stages, three weeks apart, starting on 18 May. If Covid-19 surges, it may be necessary to reverse, said Varadkar. In the first phase outdoor workers, including builders and gardeners, will be able to return to work. Hardware shops, garden centres and other selected categories will be allowed to reopen and small outdoor gatherings will be permitted. “Not long from now, some summer night, we will see our friends again,” said Varadkar. US meat production has continued to decline as the coronavirus crisis forces the shutdown of more processing facilities, sparking fears of shortages at grocery stores nationwide, writes Guardian US reporter Kenya Evelyn. The US Department of Agriculture’s weekly report found that from 27 April, beef production was down nearly 25% compared to the same time last year. Pork production was down 15%. While Sonny Perdue, the agriculture secretary, has said the US has “plenty of food for all of [its] citizens”, fewer pigs are being slaughtered at processing plants, down by nearly 50% since mid-March. Meat processing companies have paused operations as some workers have tested positive for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Last month, Tyson Foods, one of America’s largest meat producers, warned “the food supply chain is breaking” in a full-page ad in newspapers including the New York Times. “There will be limited supply of products,” the Arkansas-based company said, until it can reopen closed facilities. Restriction on movement are to continue for several more weeks in Ireland, although over-70s may now leaves their homes to exercise, Leo Varadkar has said. In an address to the nation on Friday evening, the Taoiseach said most restrictions would remain in place until 18 May, “to weaken the virus further so it doesn’t make a comeback,” the Journal reported. Thirty-four more people have died from Covid-19 in Ireland, taking the country’s total death toll 1,265, reports the Irish Department of Health. There is now a total of 20,833 confirmed cases in the country after 221 more were detected since Thursday. Donald Trump threatening to reignite the US-China trade war in reaction to coronavirus has triggered a sell-off in global financial markets, as the economic costs of the pandemic continue to mount, Richard Partington, the Guardian’s economics correspondent, reports. Against a backdrop of rising tension between the world’s two biggest economic superpowers, share prices resumed a downward slide on Friday with the FTSE 100 falling by 144 points, or 2.5%, in London. Selling pressure resumed on Wall Street after recording gradual gains in recent weeks amid rising hopes a turning point had been reached for the coronavirus crisis. As fears over the economic costs from the disease mount and as the White House ramped up the threat of a renewed trade conflict with Beijing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 2% in afternoon trading in New York. Stock prices fell sharply in Japan, with the Nikkei index of leading Japanese company shares sliding by more than 500 points, or 2.8%. Markets in China, Hong Kong and South Korea were closed for public holidays. Despite world leaders starting to outline plans to lift lockdown measures more than a month on from the depths of the crisis, the economic fallout from tight controls on social and business activity during the Covid-19 outbreak are now becoming increasingly clear A US federal judge ordered authorities to release of people from three migrant detention centres in Florida to prevent a wider spread of the coronavirus and protect detainees with underlying conditions, the Associated Press reports. District court judge Marcia Cooke issued an order late on Thursday for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to begin the steps to bring down the number of detainees from 1,400 to about 350 within two weeks. Two others orders were also issued on Thursday by federal judges in California and Louisiana siding with groups seeking the release of immigrants at high risk. In Miami, seven detainees at the Krome detention centre have tested positive for Covid-19. According to court filings at least eight members of staff have also been infected there. The judge said she found violations of the Fifth and Eight Amendments that protect due process and against unusual punishment, as conditions are worsening each day at Krome and authorities have failed at practicing social distancing at one of the other facilities. These failures have placed petitioners at a heightened risk of not only contracting COVID-19, but also succumbing to the fatal effects of the virus as some of the petitioners have serious underlying medical illness, Cook wrote in the document. Such failures amount to cruel and unusual punishment because they are exemplary of deliberate indifference. ICE was ordered to submit a report on Sunday with the steps to release detainees. Here are the latest headlines in our global coronavirus news coverage: The global number of infections passed 3.2m, while at least 233,000 have died, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University’s tally of official figures. The UK death toll rose to at least 27,510 after officials reported 739 more deaths. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said 177,454 people have tested positive; an increase of 6,201 since Thursday’s update. Of those, 15,111 are in hospital. The US military has developed as potential breakthrough test that could identify carriers before they become infectious. Researchers hope the blood test will detect the virus about four days before current tests can. Israel is to partially reopen schools on Sunday, with a full return for all students by 1 June. First, second and third graders as well as 11th and 12th graders can return to school from Sunday, the first day of the week in Israel. US activists plan biggest rent strike in decades, calling for state leaders to cancel rent during the pandemic. Activists in New York, Pennsylvania and California are encouraging tenants to withhold rent, even if they can pay. India extended its lockdown – the world’s biggest by population – for two more weeks, but with some easing of restrictions in areas with few cases. South Africa began to ease its lockdown, with some industries allowed to reopen after five weeks. Africa’s most industrialised nation was already struggling with low growth and high debts when the lockdown began on 27 March. The US handed $50m Covid-19 aid to fossil fuel firms, money that they are unlikely to have to pay back, according to a review of coronavirus aid meant for small businesses by investigative research group Documented and the Guardian. Japan is preparing for a month-long extension to its state of emergency, its prime minister, Shinzo Abe, says. He imposed an initial month-long emergency for seven regions on 7 April, before expanding it across the whole country. Six more people have died from coronavirus in Serbia, while 196 new infections were recorded, according to a report on local news site Telegraf. The latest update brings the total death toll in the Balkan country to 185, with the overall number of confirmed cases now at 9,205. Serbia has so far counted 113 male victims of the virus, and 72 female. Sixty-five patients are currently on respirators in the country. Egypt has reported 14 more deaths from Covid-19, bringing the country’s total toll to 406. According to the health ministry’s daily report, published on Facebook, 358 more confirmed cases of coronavirus were detected. So far 5,895 infections have been confirmed in Egypt, making it Africa’s second-worst affected country. Deaths from the Covid-19 epidemic in Italy climbed by 269 on Friday, down from 285 the day before, the Civil Protection Agency said, while the daily tally of new infections stood at 1,965 against 1,872 on Thursday, Reuters reports. The total death toll since the outbreak came to light on 21 February now stands at 28,236, the agency said - giving it the second highest death toll from the virus in the world after that of the US. The number of officially confirmed cases, which includes those who have died or recovered, was 207,428, the third highest global tally behind those of the US and Spain. People registered as currently carrying the illness declined to 100,943 from 101,551 on Thursday. There were 1,578 people in intensive care on Friday against a previous 1,694, maintaining a long-running decline. Of those originally infected, 78,249 were declared recovered against 75,945 a day earlier. The agency said 1.399 million people had been tested for the virus against 1.355 million the day before, out of a population of around 60 million. Scientists in Germany have said children with the coronavirus may be as infectious as adults, and urged caution as schools and playgrounds across Europe start to reopen, Kate Connolly in Berlin and Kim Willsher in Paris report. Researchers who analysed data on infected people found that the viral loads in children differed little from those in adults. Opening schools on the assumption that children are less likely to spread the virus was therefore ill-advised, said Christian Drosten, a virologist and Germany’s leading coronavirus expert, who led the team. “In the current situation, we must warn against the unlimited reopening of schools and kindergartens,” he added. Drosten’s study, which was released this week, examined the viral loads in the throats of 3,721 people, including more than 100 children, who tested positive for coronavirus in Berlin between January and April He said he had been able to carry out his analysis once the number of tests carried out by Labor Berlin, the largest laboratory of its kind in Europe, had reached the critical mass of 60,000 earlier this week. That gave him and his team, including Terry Jones, a mathematician from the Centre for Pathogen Evolution at the University of Cambridge, enough data to be able to carry out an analysis of children who have had the virus. The number of people who have died from Covid-19 in Turkey has risen by 84 in the last 24 hours to 3,258, with 2,188 new cases of the virus, Health Ministry data showed on Friday, according to Reuters. The total number of cases rose to 122,392, the data showed, the highest total outside Western Europe or the US. A total of 53,808 people have so far recovered. The number of tests conducted in the past 24 hours stood at 41,431, raising the total number of tests during the outbreak to 1.075 million. The UK has reported 739 more deaths from Covid-19, bringing the total death toll in the country to 27,510. In a daily briefing on the outbreak, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said 177,454 people have so far tested positive for coronavirus, an increase of 6,201 since yesterday. Of those, 15,111 patients are currently in hospital, Hancock said. You can see more more updates from the daily briefing on our UK blog. South Africa began to ease its strict coronavirus lockdown on Friday, allowing some industries to reopen after five weeks of restrictions, AFP reports. Africa’s most industrialised nation was already teetering with low growth and high debts when the lockdown kicked in on 27 March. Its easing comes after the ratings agency S&amp;P on Wednesday downgraded the country’s credit rating further to junk. President Cyril Ramaphosa said in a televised May Day speech: The poor and the working class are having to bear the burden of a global pandemic that has caused severe economic and social disruption … As we begin the process of easing the lockdown and many people start returning to work, we must remain vigilant and careful … The road ahead will be long and hard, and we will make mistakes. With 5,647 confirmed cases and 103 fatalities, South Africa has the continent’s highest Covid-19 death toll. But a mid-April government survey published on Friday showed that respondents were more concerned about a potential economic collapse than contracting coronavirus. People living in the poorest parts of the UK are dying from Covid-19 at double the rate of people in the richest areas, a data analysis has found, writes Caelainn Barr, the Guardian’s data projects editor. The most deprived areas had 55.1 deaths per 100,000 people – more than double that of people in the least deprived areas, where the death rate was 25.3, according to figures from England and Wales published by the Office for National Statistics on Friday. The findings have lead to calls for the government to support the most vulnerable and prompted questions about why poorer people appear to be dying in greater numbers than the wealthy. Javed Khan, the chief executive of Barnardo’s, said the crisis highlighted “deep-rooted inequalities that have been papered over for decades”. He went on: Vulnerable children and families – and those already experiencing disadvantage – risk becoming the forgotten victims. Without intervention this crisis will be devastating for a whole generation – their mental health, safety, education and job prospects are on the line. The government must ensure that the emergency funding and resources already announced reaches those in need without delay. And in the months ahead funding decisions should reflect the scale of the challenge now facing vulnerable children and families. India is to extend its coronavirus lockdown - the world’s biggest by population - but with some easing of restrictions in areas with few cases, according to AFP. The home ministry said in a statement that in view of “significant gains in the COVID-19 situation”, areas with few or no cases would see “considerable relaxations”. The lockdown imposed near the end of March has caused misery for millions of workers in India’s vast informal sector and dealt a major blow to Asia’s third-biggest economy. Air travel and passenger trains ground to a halt because of the lockdown and only the transport of “essential goods” was allowed, causing major problems as well as considerable confusion for industry and agriculture. However the stringent restrictions have been credited with keeping confirmed cases of coronavirus to about 35,000 cases as of Friday, with 1,152 deaths. The government said Friday that many activities will remain prohibited nationwide including air and rail travel - except for “select purposes” - schools, restaurants and large gatherings such as places of worship. Restrictions are being lifted largely according to what colour an area has been assigned in a government rating system. India is split into red zones with “significant risk of spread of the infection”; green zones with zero cases or no confirmed cases in the past 21 days; and those in between as orange. An outbreak of Covid-19 among workers in a meat factory in Tipperary has raised fears that the virus is spreading through abattoirs and meat-processing plants in Ireland, writes Ella McSweeney, for the Guardian’s Animals Farmed project. Sinn Féin’s spokesperson on agriculture, Brian Stanley, told the Irish parliament last night that 120 workers at the Rosderra Meats plant in Roscrea had tested positive for the virus. He also said that of 350 workers at the plant, up to 140 were off sick last week. Rosderra is the largest pork-processing company in Ireland. Michael Creed, Ireland’s agriculture minister, told MPs that he was aware of six meat-processing plants with two or more confirmed cases of Covid-19 among workers, although he did not name them. A spokesperson for Rosderra Meats confirmed to the Guardian that a number of employees had tested positive for coronavirus. They said that the company had implemented stringent measures to ensure the safety of employees, and added that production will be scaled down until all staff return to work. The World Health Organization’s daily coronavirus briefing is starting now. Today, the UN health agency is expected to announce a joint effort with the European Investment bank to support countries in addressing the health impact of Covid-19. The partnership between WHO and the world’s largest international public bank is meant to boost cooperation to strengthen public health, supply of essential equipment, training and hygiene investment in countries most vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO said in a release on Friday. It will will benefit from the EIB’s planned €1.4bn response to address the health, social and economic impact of COVID-19 in Africa. Efforts will include: scaling up investment to tackle antimicrobial resistance; improving the effectiveness of malaria treatment; scaling up investment to tackle antimicrobial resistance Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director general, said: Combining the public health experience of the World Health Organization and the financial expertise of the European Investment Bank will contribute to a more effective response to COVID-19 and other pressing health challenges. WHO looks forward to strengthening cooperation with the EIB to improve access to essential supplies including medical equipment and training, and deliver better water, sanitation and hygiene where most needed. New initiatives to improve primary health care in Africa and support the EU Malaria Fund hint at the potential impact of our new partnership As of 30 April, Vietnam has a coronavirus death count of zero and only 270 cases. Trang Bui, a Vietnamese freelance journalist based in Ho Chi Minh City, has written for the Guardian’s Comment section about how the south east Asian nation achieved it. Out of the key factors that contributed to Vietnam’s successful coronavirus response, timeliness was the first. Vietnam acted early and did not hesitate to alert its citizens. On 28 January, when the country recorded only two cases, the government announced that it was planning for a scenario in which thousands of people could contract the virus. Rwanda is to ease its coronavirus lockdown from Monday, allowing limited movement of people and restricted re-openings of restaurants and hotels, according to Reuters. Movement between provinces in the central African country will still not be allowed, while schools will also remain shut until September, according to a government statement released late on Thursday. All resumed services must adhere to health guidelines ... mask wearing and social distancing. Rwanda alongside neighbouring Uganda implemented some of the strictest lockdown measures in Africa to help slow the spread of the coronavirus, including shuttering all but the most essential businesses. As of Thursday it had 243 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and no deaths. Scientists working for the US military have designed a new Covid-19 test that could potentially identify carriers before they become infectious and spread the disease, Giles Tremlett reports for the Guardian. In what could be a significant breakthrough, project coordinators hope the blood-based test will be able to detect the virus’s presence as early as 24 hours after infection – before people show symptoms and several days before a carrier is considered capable of spreading it to other people. That is also around four days before current tests can detect the virus. The test has emerged from a project set up by the US military’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) aimed at rapid diagnosis of germ or chemical warfare poisoning. It was hurriedly repurposed when the pandemic broke out and the new test is expected to be put forward for emergency use approval (EUA) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within a week. “The concept fills a diagnostic gap worldwide,” the head of Darpa’s biological technologies office, Dr Brad Ringeisen, told the Guardian, since it should also fill in testing gaps at later stages of the infection. If given FDA approval, he said, it had the potential to be “absolutely a gamechanger”. Comoros has reported its first case of coronavirus, the World Health Organization’s Africa office said. Its daily round up of Covid-19 figures from Africa showed that South Africa and Egypt still have the most confirmed cases, while Algeria has recorded the most deaths. Riot police fanned out across Hong Kong on Friday after democracy activists threatened to defy a ban on gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic - but the streets remained largely calm, AFP reports. Activists in the semi-autonomous financial hub, which had for months protested against a strengthening of control by China’s government, had issued calls to muster once more on May Day - despite emergency anti-virus laws banning more than four people gathering in public. The threat largely failed to materialise, although hundreds of protesters did however gather in small groups at a shopping mall in the town of Shatin, chanting slogans and holding protest flags. Riot police soon rushed into the mall and used pepper spray to disperse the crowd. One protester, a retired firefighter who gave his name as Lam, said: I feel that the movement has been watered down because of the pandemic, but I personally think we should keep fighting. If we shrink back and accept our fate, then we will be living under an authoritarian regime. A day after armed protesters against Michigan’s stay-at-home order entered the statehouse in Lansing, Donald Trump has once again expressed support for the rightwing movement, writes Joan E Greve, a Guardian US politics reporter. Michigan’s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, should, the president wrote in a tweet on Friday morning, “make a deal” with the demonstrators. Some of the demonstrators in Lansing on Thursday carried assault rifles, causing alarm among legislators. Some protesters, many without face coverings, entered the statehouse and demanded to be let on to the House floor, which is not allowed. The gallery was closed to the public to allow room for representatives and reporters to spread apart. Cities around the world are taking the lead in post-coronavirus planning, with a raft of environmental initiatives being rolled out in places from Bogotá to Barcelona to ensure public safety and bolster the fight against climate breakdown, Guardian environment correspondents Matthew Taylor and Sandra Laville report. Mayors from cities in Europe, the US and Africa held talks this week to coordinate their efforts to support a low-carbon, sustainable recovery from the crisis as national governments begin to roll out huge economic stimulus packages. Many cities have already announced measures, from hundreds of miles of new bike lanes in Milan and Mexico City to widening pavements and pedestrianising neighbourhoods in New York and Seattle. The initiatives are designed to allow people to move around urban spaces safely in a world where physical distancing will be the norm for the foreseeable future – and do so without sparking a drastic increase in air pollution. The mayors who took part in the newly formed economic taskforce this week believe these initial schemes point the way to more radical long-term measures that will help tackle inequality and the climate crisis. The mayor of Milan, who is heading the taskforce run by the C40 group of cities, said: Our immediate priority is to protect the health of our residents and overcome the Covid-19 pandemic. However, we must also look towards how we will keep our people safe in the future. How we structure our recovery efforts will define our cities for decades to come. Is expecting the worst the best way to handle the coronavirus crisis? During the pandemic, it’s useful to see the role your coping mechanisms play, if only to stop yourself spiralling into anxiety, writes Oliver Burkemann, a Guardian writer based in New York, in his regular column on mental wellbeing. Exactly how terrible are the next months and years going to be? As a generally apocalyptically minded sort of person, I’ve been feeling some pride in watching my favourite question become everyone else’s favourite question, too; it’s like being a 19th-century aristocrat and seeing your debutante daughter become the star of the London season. But in deciding who to listen to, and thus how alarmed to be, it’s easy to overlook a crucial factor: in a crisis as all-consuming as this one, nobody – not academic experts, not media commentators, not that one friend who keeps urging you to be less (or more) worried than you are – is a completely neutral observer. Because predictions about the future aren’t solely about the future. They’re also coping mechanisms for dealing with the present.

Boris Johnson is of course no newcomer to Greece, a country he visited regularly in pre-corona times to sojourn at his father’s villa in Pelion, the peninsula off the mainland overlooking the Aegean Sea. Greek diplomats and politicians voice admiration for his knowledge of the classics. But Britain’s handling of the disease – its soft-touch approach and consequential catastrophic death toll - has been met with disbelief in a nation that, despite the odds has kept Covid-19 under remarkable control. In contrast to the 26,771 people who have succumbed to the pandemic in the UK which has registered 165,221 coronavirus cases so far, Greece has recorded 2,591 infections and a death toll of 140 after enforcing tough measures to curb the spread of the disease early on. Addressing reporters at his daily briefing on Thursday, the Greek health ministry spokesman and infectious disease expert professor Sotiris Tsiodras spoke of “victory” saying incidents of the illness had clearly stabilised. The UK is home to a large Greek community many of whom fled to Greece before commercial air traffic was suspended in March. Indicative of the mood the popular Protothema newspaper reported the news of the birth of the prime minister’s latest child under the headline: “Johnson, father amid national sorrow over coronavirus.” “In the midst of the national sorrow that has weighed down on British society, the birth of Boris Johnson’s son has once again brought his personal life, one that is as unconventional as he is, back in the public eye,” the paper wrote. “[A life] with two marriages, an engagement, three extra marital affairs and at least six children.” Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, continued to fly in the face of science on Thursday when he called social isolation measures introduced by state governors and mayors “useless”. He said: We know that many people will die. I’m sorry. Seventy percent of the population will be infected and, from what it seems, from what we are seeing now, up until now all this effort to flatten the curve was practically useless. What’s the consequence, the collateral effect of this? Unemployment. The people want to go back to work. The president has consistently sought to downplay the impacts of the pandemic, arguing that Brazilians would be immune because they jump in sewage, and mixing with supporters. Brazil has 85,380 confirmed cases and 5,901 deaths with 435 reported in the last 24 hours as numbers accelerate. His new health minister, Nelson Teich, earlier contradicted this view. “You can’t start freeing things up when you have a curve that is frankly ascending,” he said. While there are no definitive studies about the impact of social isolation on the growth of Brazil’s cases, experts believe it has had a positive impact. The worst-hit state of São Paulo, for instance, was supposed to see a peak in April but this has now been moved to May, the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper reported. “Brazil had flattened the curve, yes, with isolation measures, but in the last two weeks we are seeing a loosening of isolation and what we are seeing is a new acceleration of the epidemic,” Fernando Bozza,a researcher in infectious diseases at the government research institute Fiocruz in Rio de Janeiro who is modelling the pandemic, told the Guardian. Malaysia on Friday detained hundreds of refugees and migrant workers for illegally living in the country, rights groups said, at a time of movement and travel restrictions imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19. Malaysia has around two million registered foreign workers but authorities estimate many more are living in the Southeast Asian country without proper documents. Malaysia does not formally recognise refugees, regarding them as illegal migrants. The arrests followed immigration raids in a neighbourhood in capital Kuala Lumpur where thousands of migrant workers and refugees live, according to human rights groups and photos shared on social media. Human Rights Watch and the Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network said over 700 migrants were taken into custody including young children. Malaysian police and the immigration department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Rachel Tan, programme officer at the Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network, said the arrests were a “criminalisation of a people who toil in difficult and dangerous work conditions”. The neighbourhood where the raids took place was close to an area with three buildings that had been placed under strict lockdowns last month after a surge in coronavirus cases there. Malaysia has reported a total of 6,071 coronavirus cases and 103 deaths, and its prime minister said on Friday that most businesses will reopen from Monday following six-week long curbs that have caused a damaging economic slowdown. Big Macs delivered on meal trolleys, hand washing stations at the entrance and designated waiting spots to separate customers could become a feature of McDonald’s restaurants in the Netherlands when they are allowed to reopen. In a trial at a restaurant in the city of Arnhem, McDonald’s has been looking for ways to maintain social distancing when the coronavirus lockdown is relaxed. McDonald’s Netherlands spokeswoman Eunice Koekkoek told Reuters: We have tried to figure out how to keep our customers and employees safe, while maintaining a restaurant atmosphere. These are drastic changes, but we hope to make them in a way that customers don’t notice them too much. Restaurants, bars and other public places in the Netherlands have been closed since 15 March. But new infections have been dropping, prompting calls to loosen the lockdown after its current deadline of 19 May. A decision on whether to reopen restaurants and bars is expected around 12 May, but the prime minister, Mark Rutte, has ruled out a return to normal. If they do reopen, they will have to keep customers and staff at least 1.5 meters (5 feet) apart to avoid a new wave of infections. McDonald’s says it could introduce table service, with burgers and fries wheeled to customers on trolleys from which they can pick up their orders. Other new features would include hand-washing stations at the entrance and a host behind a plastic screen showing customers their place in line. Many restaurant owners in the Netherlands fear social distancing will simply put them out of business. But McDonald’s expects its new set-up will work at 180 larger restaurants out of its 252 franchises in the country. Koekkoek said: On average this will allow us to serve around 66% of our normal number of customers. We don’t expect reopening to be allowed before June. But even then, we will move in steps. Readjusting 180 restaurants is a tall order. The Hungarian budget carrier, Wizz Air, flew into London’s Luton airport from Sofia on Friday, becoming one of the first European airlines to restart routes during the coronavirus pandemic. At least one person onboard seen through the window was wearing a face mask. There were also dozens of passengers within the airport, spaced out for social distancing, possibly for the return flight which took off shortly afterwards. European airlines have grounded the majority of their fleets over the last six weeks as governments imposed travel restrictions to combat the spread of the virus. But Wizz Air said last week it planned to put some of its planes back in the air for essential travel, restoring services to destinations in Romania, Budapest in Hungary, Lisbon in Portugal and Spain’s Tenerife plus a few more. The London Luton arrivals and departures board showed three Wizz Air flights were due to arrive and depart on Friday. The airline says it is important to get the infrastructure operating and that there are people across Europe who need to travel for work. Across Europe, air traffic is down by about 90% according to global body IATA, with the flights that are still operating facilitating the repatriation of citizens, travel by medical experts and cargo supplies. Given ongoing travel restrictions - UK government advice for example is for Britons to avoid all non-essential global travel and Wizz has said that it does not expect flights to be full, enabling it to maintain social distancing onboard. The airline, whose geographic focus is on central and eastern Europe, has said all passengers must wear masks on flights while its crew will wear masks and gloves. When travel restrictions do start to ease, it is likely that there will be tougher measures for flying, which could affect demand. Britain is considering a two-week quarantine requirement for arrivals into the country. India is extending its nationwide lockdown for another two weeks after 4 May, but will allow “considerable relaxations”. These will apply in lower-risk districts marked as green and orange zones, under the government’s plan to fight the Covid-19. Ural Airlines has begun delivering in-flight meals to travel-deprived Russians who miss the thrill of a catering cart rolling down the aisle because of coronavirus lockdown. The airline, which is delivering its in-flight meals to customers in Moscow, St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg, said the initiative was meant to provide people with “the taste of travel without leaving your home”. “Everything is just like on the airplane except for the view,” it wrote on its Instagram page on Thursday. Russia has closed its borders to foreigners and grounded international flights, except those repatriating Russians or returning foreign nationals to their country of origin. Ural Airlines’ service offers the staples of airline meals - chicken, meat and fish - as well as orange, apple and tomato juice. The meal is served on a traditional airline tray. US fossil fuel companies have taken at least $50m in taxpayer money they likely won’t have to pay back, according to a review of coronavirus aid meant for struggling small businesses by the investigative research group Documented and the Guardian, writes Guardian US environment reporter Emily Holden in Washington. A total of $28m is going to three coal mining companies, including two with ties to Trump officials, bolstering a dying American industry and a fuel that scientists insist world leaders must shift away from to avoid the worst of the climate crisis. The other $22m is being paid out to oil and gas services and equipment providers and other firms that work with drillers and coal miners. Melinda Pierce, the legislative director for the Sierra Club, said: The federal money Congress appropriated should be going to help small businesses and frontline workers struggling as a result of the pandemic, not the corporate polluters whose struggles are a result of failing business practices and existed long before Covid-19 entered the public lexicon. This fascinating thread is an account of how a remote fishing village in Iceland dealt with its coronavirus outbreak. It is worth clicking through to read in full. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the Netherlands has risen by 475 to 39,791 health authorities said on Friday, with 98 new deaths. The country’s death toll stands at 4,893, the Dutch institute for public health and the environment (RIVM) said in its daily update. The RIVM cautioned it only reports confirmed cases, and actual numbers are higher. But it said the latest figures are “in line with the impression that the measures [taken to deal with the outbreak] are working,” adding: The number of new hospital admissions reported per day is still decreasing. The same applies to the number of reported deaths. The country is on course to reopen primary schools on 11 May, with secondary schools planned to reopen the following month. The world’s largest public service union federation, Public Services International, has launched a 12-hour virtual May Day live stream to celebrate the public service workers who are keeping society going during the coronavirus pandemic. With more than 600 affiliated unions, PSI represents more than 20 million workers in 180 countries. They are calling on unions and workers across the world to take action from their homes rather than in the streets. In a blog posted to their website today, PSI general secretary, Rosa Pavanelli, said: This May Day, for the first time in a century, workers won’t be in the streets. They’re busy saving the world. They’re keeping our relatives on life support. They’re keeping food systems flowing. They are risking their lives to save lives - not as heroes, but as professionals. As Trade Unions, the only way we can do justice to these momentous efforts is by winning the deep, systemic change which workers, now more than ever, need and deserve. Anyone who wants to take part is encouraged to post a solidarity message to frontline workers to social media, using the hashtag #VirtualMayDay, or chat join the live chat on the stream on Vimeo or Facebook. By eschewing the kinds of lockdowns seen elsewhere in the world, Sweden has taken a different and controversial approach to tackling the coronavirus pandemic. That has led to international criticism and wounded national pride, writes Gina Gustavsson, an academic at Uppsala University. She asks: has Sweden’s coronavirus strategy played into the hands of nationalists? Sweden has persisted with the strategy of coronavirus mitigation that the UK government eventually abandoned in March. The policy is widely supported by the public, even though the Swedish Covid-19 mortality rate is among the 10 highest in the world, at 240 per million population and steadily rising, and many of the nursing homes in Stockholm are now affected. The typical explanation for this continued public support is that Swedes are trusting and unflappable. The country’s chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, the public face of the Swedish response to the pandemic, is after all a dry scientist-turned-bureaucrat, not some populist politician trying to whip up nationalist go-it-alone emotion. But beneath the surface, Sweden is anything but calm. The public debate is inflamed with a sense of wounded national pride. As a believer in the kind of liberal nationalism that encourages self-critical national attachment, this pains me. But as a scholar of nationalism, I recognise the pattern. This is what Isaiah Berlin called the nationalism of “the bent twig”, which lashes out against anyone who steps on it. Thousands of Indian students unable to leave the UK because of the coronavirus lockdown are relying on food donations from charities because they can no longer afford to eat, Anna Fazackerly reports for the Guardian. Student groups representing the students, from across Britain, have been coordinating emergency food drops with local community groups and charities. Many of the young people have lost their part-time jobs and can no longer afford even basic living costs. The Indian National Students’ Association, one of the largest student groups, says so far it has helped to distribute food to more than 3,000 struggling students across the country. A second UK-wide students’ group, the National Indian Students and Alumni Union, says it has also had calls from hundreds of students who cannot afford food. Charan Sekhon, the chair of an Anglo-Indian charity based in Bedford called the Seva Trust, which has delivered food parcels to more than 60 Indian students in its local area, says: “We have had lots of examples where students are actually starving. They haven’t got anything at all to eat.” India banned all international flights from 22 March, giving students only two days to arrange to get home. Flights that typically cost around £300 were selling for £2,000, and thousands of students found themselves stranded in Britain. Singapore has begun moving migrant workers who have recovered from coronavirus infections to two cruise ships in an effort to curb its spread in workers’ dormitories, AFP reports. After taking swift and aggressive measures that initially controlled its outbreak, Singapore has been hit by a bigger second wave among the work permit holders who carry out many of the basic services that keep the city running. On Friday, Singapore’s ministry of health reported 932 new infections, the majority of which were among migrant workers, who are housed in sprawling dormitory complexes. Just five cases were found among Singapore nationals or so-called permanent residents. So far it has reported 17,101 cases but just 15 deaths. A group of migrant workers boarded the SuperStar Gemini, a mid-sized cruise ship, on Wednesday, and another vessel, the SuperStar Aquarius, is ready to receive more after undergoing assessments by government agencies, the Singapore Tourism Board said on Friday. Together, the vessels can accommodate up to 2,000. Fifteen people have been arrested in Istanbul, Turkey, for trying to stage a May Day march in defiance of coronavirus lockdown measures, according to the Associated Press. The Confederation of Progressive Trade Unions of Turkey, or DISK, tweeted that its head Arzu Cerkezoglu and several other union leaders were detained near Taksim Square, where they wanted to lay wreaths of carnations. The Istanbul governor’s office said the demonstrators were later released. The statement added that various trade unions had left wreaths in Taksim Square, as permitted by the governor’s office, but that DISK had insisted on collectively marching to the square, which was in breach of lockdown and social distancing rules. Taksim Square holds a symbolic value for Turkeys labour movement. In 1977, 34 people were killed there during a May Day event when shots were fired into the crowd from a nearby building. Turkey has imposed partial lockdowns in 31 provinces every weekend and on national holidays. Exemptions apply, including for many labourers who continue to work amid the pandemic. The ban on May Day demonstrations in Taksim has been in effect for several years, due to security concerns. Police closed all roads leading to Taksim Square with barricades and increased security presence Friday. Turkey ranks seventh in the world for the number of confirmed infections with 120,204 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University, although experts believe the actual toll of the pandemic is higher than the tally. The country’s official death toll stands at 3,174. Here are the latest headlines in our international coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. China’s Hubei province will lower its coronavirus emergency response from the highest to the second-highest level. The announcement follows months of strict lockdown. The virus was first detected in the province’s capital, Wuhan, in late 2019. Deprived areas of England and Wales have double the death rates of affluent areas. Of the 20,283 Covid-19 registered deaths in England and Wales to 17 April, an overwhelming proportion of fatalities were of people from the poorest areas, figures from the Office for National Statistics revealed. Russia reported 7,933 new cases of Covid-19 in a record daily rise, bringing the nationwide tally to 114,431. The official nationwide death toll rose to 1,169 after 96 people with the virus died in the last 24 hours, Russia’s coronavirus crisis response centre said. Ryanair is to cut 3,000 jobs reduce staff pay by up to a fifth in response to the Covid-19 crisis, which has grounded flights. The no-frills airline said it did not expect passenger numbers or pricing to return to pre-coronavirus levels until summer 2022 at the earliest. Queensland, Australia, cleared way for the National Rugby League season to restart. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has opened the state border in preparation for restart of the National Rugby League (NRL) season on 28 May. One million people have recovered from coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Infections worldwide stand at 3,269,667. More than 233,700 people have died in the pandemic so far. Trump claimed he has seen evidence that Covid-19 originated in Wuhan lab. When the president was asked if he has seen anything that gives you a “high degree of confidence” that coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Donald Trump replied: “Yes, I have.” His own government experts say the virus was “not manmade or genetically modified”. Israel’s government just announced the country will partially reopen schools on Sunday, with a full return to for all students by 1 June, reports Oliver Holmes, the Guardian’s Jerusalem correspondent. First, second and third graders as well as 11th and 12th graders can return to school as of Sunday, the first day of the week in Israel. Childcare and kindergartens, ages zero to six, will remain closed for at least another week, the government said. Despite seeing a drop in the number of daily virus infections during the past few days, the reopening of schools has been a contentious issue in Israel, with fierce debate within the government around whether it was a premature step. Following Friday’s announcement, the mayor of Tel Aviv said he would not allow schools to open there. Ron Huldai was quoted by Haaretz newspaper as saying the plan “doesn’t ensure the wellbeing and health of the children”. A partial reopening has also been criticised by parents of children of different ages who will still not be able to work. The country has 15,946 total confirmed cases and 223 deaths. A report by Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) yesterday heighten concerns among US officials and lawmakers that the pandemic threatens to derail stalled US-led peace efforts, Akhtar Mohammad Makoii reports. The spread of COVID-19 already has significantly impacted Afghanistan, the report said, from complicating the peace initiative to forcing border crossing closures that have disrupted commercial and humanitarian deliveries. “Afghanistan’s numerous and, in some cases, unique vulnerabilities - a weak health-care system, widespread malnutrition, porous borders, massive internal displacement, contiguity with Iran, and ongoing conflict - make it likely the country will confront a health disaster in the coming months,” the report said. Meanwhile Save the Children announced yesterday that around seven million children are at risk of hunger due to the lockdowns following spread Coronavirus in Afghanistan. “At a time when Afghan children need adequate daily nutrition to help strengthen their immune systems to fight the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the price of basic foods is rising under the lockdown, making it harder for families to feed themselves,” the report said. The organization also warned that a third of the country will face food shortages. “A third of the population – including 7.3 million children – will face food shortages in April and May due to the current pandemic,” the organisation said. According to the organisation, even before the global COVID-19 crisis, the total number of children who needed some form of humanitarian support this year stood at 5.26 million, making war-torn Afghanistan one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a child. In case you needed it, here is a video explaining why the 5G coronavirus conspiracy theory is false. France’s education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, is today expected to announce strict rules for the reopening of crêches, nursery and primary schools later this month, writes Kim Willsher, the Guardian’s Paris correspondent. A provisional document seen by Le Monde and AFP suggests rules will be strict in applying accepted barrier and social distancing regulations, but it has already been declared unworkable by teachers, especially for classes of younger children. Teachers are expected to return on 11 May to prepare for the restarting of classes the following day. The draft health protocol says children must wash their hands on arrival at school, before and after visiting lavatories, before and after each meal, after playtime, after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing and touching shared objects and before going home. Taps and running water are to be preferred but sanitising gel must be provided if this is not possible. Ball games and contact games are banned and there is to be no exchange of personal objects. If more than one child touches an object it should be disinfected. There must be staggered recreation and play breaks, and limited changes of room – French children tend to take different subjects in different classes – as well a one-way system organised in school buildings so pupils can maintain a 1-metre minimum distance from each other. Classes to be regularly disinfected and aired and doors left open to avoid pupils touching handles. The wearing of masks is not obligatory for nursery school children, but is advised, and staff must wear masks. There will also be a limit to the number of children in each class –reportedly 10 children for those in crêches and nurseries, and 15 in primary schools. It must be stressed these are details in the provisional protocol, which needs to be confirmed by the education minister today. The two lowest years in secondary schools will start back the following week, on 18 May. A decision on other years will be made at the end of May for a possible return to class on 2 June. Another unknown factor is what say local mayors will have in deciding whether schools in their areas should reopen or if restarting classes poses too much of a risk, particularly in areas designated “red”, where the virus is circulating. Japan is preparing for a month-long extension to its coronavirus state of emergency, prime minister Shinzo Abe said on Friday. Abe imposed an initial month-long emergency for seven regions on 7 April, before subsequently expanding it across the whole country. With measures due to expire next week, Abe said he had told his minister responsible for handling the outbreak, Yasutoshi Nishimura, to plan for an extension, AFP reports. He was quoted as saying: After receiving [a] report from the panel of experts, I asked Minister Nishimura to use extending the current framework of the state of emergency by about one month as the base scenario for swiftly drafting plans that will fit the needs of the regions An extension of the state of emergency had been widely expected, despite the comparatively small scale of the outbreak in Japan, with nearly 14,300 infections recorded and 432 deaths so far. Thousands of people in the US plan to take part in a rent strike on Friday, calling for state leaders to cancel rent during the coronavirus crisis, writes Guardian US reporter Adam Gabbatt. Activists in New York, Pennsylvania and California are encouraging tenants to withhold rent, whether they are able to pay or not, to draw attention to the plight of those unable to pay. The protest is expected to represent the largest coordinated rent strike in America in decades, and comes as the labor department announced another 3.8 million people lost their jobs last week, with pressure growing on state leaders nationwide to increase their efforts on housing. More than 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits in the past six weeks, as the coronavirus has caused widespread business closures. The New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is among those voicing support for the strikes, which are being coordinated by an array of housing groups. “People aren’t striking because they don’t feel like paying rent, they’re striking because they can’t,” Ocasio-Cortez said. Sixty-three more people have died from Covid-19 in Iran, bringing the total death toll in the country to 6,091, health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said in a statement on state TV on Friday, according to Reuters. The total number of diagnosed cases of the coronavirus in the Islamic Republic, one of the Middle Eastern countries hardest hit by the outbreak, has reached 95,646, including 2,899 in critical condition, he added. Hello and happy International Workers Day to readers around the world. This is Damien Gayle taking control of the global live blog now for the next eight hours, bringing you the latest international news on the coronavirus outbreak. If you have any tips, comments or suggestions for coverage please drop me a line via email to damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or in a direct message on Twitter to @damiengayle. Spain has recorded 281 coronavirus deaths over the past 24 hours, compared with 268 yesterday, as it prepares for the first phase of the lockdown exit strategy. The total number of deaths stands at 24,824. On Saturday, people of all ages will be allowed out for exercise for the first time in seven weeks, a week after children were allowed out to play if accompanied by an adult. To avoid overcrowding, separate time slots have been allocated for the elderly, people with the children and everyone else. Barcelona has opened half of its parks and closed 44 streets to traffic in order to facilitate social distancing. The Madrid region will monitor 2m mobile phones to observe how the relaxed lockdown is progressing. Today, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, the Madrid regional president, formally closed the vast field hospital at the capital’s IFEMA exhibition centre, which opened 41 days ago. The temporary hospital, which came to symbolise the nation’s fight against the virus, had 5,500 beds. Of the thousands of coronavirus patients admitted, 98% survived. In a provisional assessment of the economic impact of the health crisis, the government estimates Spain’s GDP will fall by 9.2% this year. Ministers said today the virus has so far cost the nation €139bn, of which around €17bn has gone on paying furloughed employees. After ending 2019 with a public deficit of 2.8%, this year it is expected to be 10.7%. In Afghanistan, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases continued to surge on Friday in Kandahar as nationwide number of infections reached 2,335, amid increasing number of health workers testing positive. A health ministry spokesman said 164 new Covid-19 cases were recorded in last 24 hours, most of which were new infections recorded in southern province of Kandahar as total number of confirmed cases reached 339 with 45 confirmed today in the province. Four patients died in the same period, taking the death toll to 68 in the war-torn country. There have so far been 310 recoveries, 50 of which have been in last 24 hours. Wahidullah Mayar, the health ministry spokesman, said 228 health workers have so far tested positive for Covid-19, most of them are confirmed in Kandahar with 38 cases. In Kabul, the country’s worst affected area, the health ministry reported 44 new Coronavirus cases, bringing the total number to 617. Mayar said spread of the virus in Afghanistan is “fast” and asked people to stay at home as the country is yet to reach its peak in number of deaths and infections. Despite the lockdown, in most of cities streets were still crowded with vehicles and people walking freely around. Hundreds of workers at Amazon warehouses, Whole Foods grocery stores, Target retail stores, and shoppers at Instacart and Shipt called out sick on Friday as part of a coordinated one-day strike across the US in protest of working conditions and inadequate safety protections during the coronavirus pandemic. The 1 May walkout began after Amazon ended its unlimited unpaid time off policy for workers at the end of April. “The fact they took it away prior to the sick-out lets you know they’re aware of the sick-out and trying to stop people from participating in that,” said Derrick Palmer, an Amazon employee at the JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island, New York, who has worked at Amazon for more than four years. “Now they’re forcing people to go to work because if you run out of unpaid time off, that’s it, you’re fired.” Palmer was one of the workers who participated in protests outside of JFK8 warehouse a few weeks ago in demand of safety protections for Amazon workers. An assistant manager at JFK8, Chris Smalls, was fired shortly after he organised the protest. Palmer said that after the protests, Amazon began providing personal protective equipment to workers and enforcing social distancing rules and temperature checks, but he said cleaning procedures remain inadequate. The Office for National Statistics has published analysis on Covid-19 deaths by local areas and deprivation in England and Wales. The London mortality rate was significantly higher than any other region. The analysis found a strong link between how deprived an area is and the coronavirus mortality rate. In England, the mortality rate of deaths involving Covid-19 in the most deprived areas was more than double that in the least deprived areas: Most deprived: 55.1 deaths per 100,000 population Least deprived: 25.3 deaths per 100,000 population The Guardian will be digging into this data set throughout the day, but you can read it yourself here. Armed protesters enter Michigan’s state capitol demanding an end to coronavirus lockdown. Hundreds of protesters, some armed, attempted to enter the legislative chamber of Michigan’s state capitol, in response to moves to extend Covid-19 lockdown orders. The demonstrators gathered as the Democrat governor, Gretchen Whitmer, pushed for stay-at-home orders to continue to mid-May. The state has recorded 3,789 coronavirus deaths. China Xinhua News reports that Central China’s Hubei province, where the coronavirus outbreak started, will lower its emergency response from the highest to the second-highest level starting on 2 May, following months of strict lockdown. Here’s more information on Australia’s road to recovery by Guardian reporter Paul Karp and Daniel Hurst. Scott Morrison has offered Australians an “early mark” to ease Covid-19 restrictions next week while warning a return to normality will depend on uptake of the Covidsafe contact tracing app. The prime minister dangled the prospect of a potential loosening of the rules next Friday as he issued his strongest declaration yet that it was conditional on more downloads. Morrison also revealed that net overseas migration is down 30% and is expected to fall by 80% in 2020-21, both compared with 2018-19, in a sign the economic contraction from Covid-19 will last much longer than restrictions to social life. Treasury officials and the Reserve Bank both estimate that unemployment is set to top 10%. The first restrictions were eased this week with New South Wales allowing visits to friends and relatives, and a similar measure announced on Friday in the Australian Capital Territory, the first Australian jurisdiction with no active cases. In Greece, protesters have begun gathering in central Athens for traditional May Day marches, AP reports, despite authorities’ pleas to unions to move their demonstrations to next week after lockdown measures begin easing. More than 100 people from the Communist party-affiliated PAME union gathered in Athens’ main Syntagma Square, outside parliament. Holding banners and red flags, and most wearing masks and gloves, the protesters stood roughly 2 metres (6.5ft) apart from each other as they waited for the march to begin. The Philippines on Friday reported 284 new coronavirus infections and 11 more deaths, Reuters reports, bringing its total number of cases to 8,772 and fatalities to 579. It also said 41 more individuals had recovered, bringing total recoveries to 1,084. France’s state-owned SNCF railways company estimates it will lose at least €3bn (£2.6bn) in revenue as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, Les Echos daily newspaper reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources. Reuters reports the group has been running only 7% of its high-speed trains and 20% of regional services since mid-March and will be allowed to resume only about 30% of its network from 11 May as France seeks to manage the post-lockdown period. Les Echos newspaper said strikes over government pension reforms that started in early December in France has already cost the company €1bn in lost revenue. The newspaper said the company lost €700m in March, €1.4bn in April and expects losses to reach €3bn before a nationwide lockdown begins to ease from 11 May. EPA has this shot of a family wearing protective face masks while visiting Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China, on 1 May. China is loosening up nationwide restrictions after months of lockdown over the coronavirus crisis. Labour Day in the country kicked off with a long weekend and an extended holiday, from 1-5 May, after the tourism industry has been hit during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Rwanda will partially lift its virus lockdown from next week and allow people to move freely during the day more than six weeks after being confined, the prime minister’s office said Friday, AFP reports. Rwanda was one of the first to impose strict lockdown measures in Africa, on 22 March, when it had only 19 cases, and to date has officially recorded 225 cases and zero deaths. From Monday 4 May, people will be allowed to move freely from 5am to 8pm, but will need permission to do so later in the evening, the prime minister’s office said in a statement. Businesses, manufacturing and construction operations will be allowed to resume with essential workers, while markets will be allowed to open with no more than 50%t of traders operating. Hotels and restaurants will be allowed to operate but must close by 7pm. While people will be allowed to exercise in open spaces, sports facilities will remain closed. No more than 30 people will be allowed to attend funerals, and schools, churches, gyms and bars will remain closed. The speaker of Pakistan’s national assembly said late on Thursday that he had tested positive for Covid-19, after hosting an iftar dinner to celebrate Ramadan, Reuters reports, and meeting prime minister Imran Khan and other high officials earlier in the week. It remains unclear if Khan will be tested after Faisal Edhi tested positive. Khan tested negative in April, after meeting with the head of Pakistan’s biggest charity organisation, who was subsequently confirmed to have caught the disease. The assembly, the lower house of parliament, is in recess, though opposition parties have been calling for it to convene to discuss the government’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak in the country, where the number of cases has risen to 16,817, including 385 deaths. Russia reported its biggest daily rise of confirmed coronavirus cases on Friday , with 7,933 new cases. The record daily rise brings the nationwide tally to 114,431, Reuters reports. The official nationwide death toll rose to 1,169 after 96 people with the virus died in the last 24 hours, Russia’s coronavirus crisis response centre said. AFP have put together a brilliant photo gallery of May Day workers confronting coronavirus around the world. It is a celebration of the cleaners, transport workers, shop assistants, tradespeople, health workers and more who continue to serve despite the difficulties and risks of the pandemic. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Germany increased by 1,639 to 160,758 on Friday, according to data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases. The daily update showed the death toll rose by 193 to 6,481. Mikhail Mishustin, the Russian prime minister, who was tasked by Vladimir Putin with leading the response to the country’s coronavirus outbreak, has been diagnosed with Covid-19 and will self-isolate. Mishustin, Russia’s most-high profile Covid-19 patient so far, disclosed the diagnosis during a televised video call with President Putin on Thursday evening. It was not immediately clear how severe Mishustin’s symptoms are, though one news agency reported that he had an elevated temperature of 39 degrees. Putin indicated during the call that Mishustin would be taken to hospital. Confirmed coronavirus cases in Russia passed 100,000 on Thursday. The first deputy prime minister, Andrei Belousov, would take on Mishustin’s duties in his absence, Putin said. Ryanair is planning to cut 3,000 jobs and reduce staff pay by up to a fifth in response to the Covid-19 crisis, which has grounded flights. The no-frills airline said it did not expect passenger numbers or pricing to return to pre-coronavirus levels until summer 2022 at the earliest. As part of a programme of sweeping cost cuts, Ryanair said it could close a number of bases across Europe until air travel recovers. The company, which expects to report a net loss of more than €100m (£87m) for the first quarter and through the summer, said restructuring and job losses would start in July. The job cuts will affect mostly pilots and cabin crew, although the measures will also hit head office and back office teams. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has opened Queensland’s border in preparation for next month’s restart of the National Rugby League (NRL) season. Palaszczuk not only gave the green light for the state’s three NRL clubs to train at their base and travel interstate, but also host home games. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison had said earlier on Friday it would be a matter for state jurisdictions to clear any resumption of sporting activities, following a meeting of the national cabinet. Hungary needs to prepare for a potential second wave of the coronavirus outbreak in October-November, even though the spreading of the virus will likely slow in the summer, prime minister Viktor Orbán told state radio on Friday, according to a report by Reuters. Orban also said if authorities manage to reduce the death rate from the pandemic in Budapest, where 80% of deaths have been recorded, only then will current restrictions be eased in the capital city. Hungary will lift a large part of restrictions in the countryside from Monday. Migrant workers on Spanish farms that provide fruit and vegetables for UK supermarkets are trapped in dire conditions under lockdown, living in cardboard and plastic shelters without food or running water. Thousands of workers, many of them undocumented, live in settlements between huge greenhouses on farms in the southern Spanish provinces of Huelva and Almeria, key regions for European supply chains. Local union activists have been supporting the migrants, bringing them water, food and basic supplies since Spain declared a lockdown in mid March. Clare Carlile from Ethical Consumer, a UK charity supporting the local activists, says the situation is the result of years of neglect of workers. “They got visited by the Spanish army on 18 March and told to stay put, even though in some places running water is several kilometres away. Now, with Covid fears, a water truck comes twice a week. If you are at work and miss it you must walk several kilometres for water after a hard day. “Failure of employers provide basic rights has for years created dire circumstances for the inhabitants of the settlements. Now, the pandemic has pushed the situation to crisis point.” London’s Heathrow airport, traditionally the busiest in Europe, said passenger numbers were expected to be down by around 97% in April. Reuters reports that for the first quarter, revenue fell 12.7% to £593m ($745m) and adjusted EBITDA fell by 22.4% to £315m. Heathrow expects passenger numbers to remain weak until governments across the world fighting the coronavirus outbreak deem it safe to travel. The airport said it had £3.2bn in liquidity, sufficient to maintain the business at least over the next 12 months, even with no passengers. Morning, I’m Aamna Mohdin taking over the liveblog from my colleague Helen. Please do send tips and comments to aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com or you can tweet me at @aamnamohdin Carmela Fonbuena reports for the Guardian: Philippine provinces considered to have a low to moderate number of coronavirus cases began easing lockdowns on Friday 1 May, amid concerns from local officials and residents who are wary that the real scale of the outbreak cannot be known until the country conducts more testing. “Many provinces are still just seeing imported cases from other areas. When [strict lockdowns are] lifted they expect imported cases to come in,” said former health secretary Manuel Dayrit. The rules remain unclear. The government initially said religious gatherings will be allowed provided physical distancing is observed, but it’s now under review following concerns raised. The Philippines recorded 8,488 cases as of 30 April, including 568 deaths. The numbers are believed to be higher as the country of 110 million people has tested less than 100,000 individuals. It’s a testament to its poor healthcare system as many hospitals struggle to meet requirements for coronavirus testing. The decision made by a national government taskforce on coronavirus put several local officials in a difficult position. In the provinces of Ilocos Norte, La Union, and Albay, where residents oppose the government decision, local leaders cannot extend strict lockdowns without government approval. “Lifting will only return the virus into a second wave,” said Joey Salceda, a lawmaker from Albay province, which recorded three deaths among total 28 cases but he is afraid there are undetected cases. Metro Manila will remain in strict lockdown but certain restrictions will be lifted to allow some government infrastructure work to continue. Groups of overseas Filipino workers stranded in the capital due to provincial lockdowns have been allowed go home, too. Although this development is definitely worth mentioning again, too: With that, I’m ducking away. My colleague Aamna Mohdin will be with you for the next few hours. Here are the most important developments from the last few hours: 1 million people have recovered from coronavirus. According to Johns Hopkins University data, more than a million people have now recovered from coronavirus infection, with the total at 1,014,524. Infections worldwide stand at 3,256,570. More than 233,300 people have died in the pandemic so far. Boris Johnson says UK ‘past the peak’. The prime minister promised to set out next week how schools and workplaces could safely reopen once lockdown restrictions were eased, as he claimed the UK was past the peak of the coronavirus outbreak. Despite announcing an increase of 674 in the death toll of the virus, taking it to a total of 26,771, Johnson suggested the worst was over. US jobless toll amounts to 18.4% of working-age population. Thirty million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits since 21 March. The White House let its two-week-old economic reopening guidelines expire on Thursday as half of all US states forged ahead with their own strategies for easing restrictions on restaurants, retail and other businesses shuttered by the coronavirus crisis, Reuters reports. Trump claims he has seen evidence that Covid-19 originated in Wuhan lab. When the president was asked if he has seen anything that gives you a “high degree of confidence” that coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Donald Trump replied: “Yes, I have.” His own government experts say the virus was ‘not manmade or genetically modified’. US intelligence agencies have been under pressure to link coronavirus to Chinese labs. Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, later said of the lab theory: “What we have before us doesn’t suggest that is a likely source”. Protesters, some armed, gather inside Michigan state capitol. Hundreds of protesters, some armed, gathered inside Michigan’s state capitol on Thursday as state lawmakers debated the Democratic governor’s request to extend her emergency powers to combat coronavirus. Major US airlines will require passengers to cover their faces during flights.

British BAME Covid-19 death rate ‘more than twice that of whites’. The death rate among British black Africans and British Pakistanis from coronavirus in English hospitals is more than 2.5 times that of the white population, according to stark analysis by the Institute of Fiscal Studies. UK food banks face record demand. The first two weeks of the coronavirus lockdown triggered an unprecedented rise in food bank use as the economy was hit and household incomes plunged, data from hundreds of emergency food aid charities reveals. Jacinda Ardern’s popularity surges during lockdown. An opinion poll in New Zealand has found the prime minister’s approval rating jumped to 65% during the country’s nearly five-week strict lockdown. It puts her in a strong position ahead of this year’s general election. Her Labour party also did well, achieving a 55% approval rating. ‘Australia has earned an early mark’ Australia has brought forward its decision on easing restrictions to next Friday 8 May in a further sign that the country is successfully flattening the curve. Australia, which in late March recorded around 400 new cases of the virus a day, now consistently has fewer than 20 new cases daily. Restrictions on movement were put into place at the end of March, including the closure of schools in some states, as well as restaurants, pubs and some businesses, as well as restrictions on the number of people who can gather together. Prime Minister Scott Morrison was due to announce which of these restrictions would be lifted on 11 May after discussion with state premiers, but says the announcement has been brought forward three days, with a cheerful Morrison telling a press conference on Friday that “Australians have earned an early mark.” He added that “we didn’t expect to be in this position six weeks ago”. Australia’s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said Australia will begin testing cohorts of asymptomatic people in an attempt to ensure early detection of any new outbreaks and avoid a second wave. That cluster testing will be focused on groups that have a high risk of exposure or work with vulnerable people, like aged care workers or healthcare workers. Teachers are among those who might get tested. Says Murphy: We need to test more people. If we are going to get on top of those small outbreaks ... we cannot afford to have an outbreak that takes off so that we get a second wave when we reduce restrictions such as a number of other countries have seen. So our testing has to be very good. He says that the case data shows that most people who transmit the virus do still have symptoms, so anyone with any symptoms should get tested. The most important thing in testing is for anyone who has respiratory symptoms, a cough or a cold or a sore throat, to get tested ... get tested and don’t go to work. Cholera and coronavirus: why we must not repeat the same mistakes Coronavirus is not the only pandemic the world faces. There is another one raging right now. Since cholera first spread across the globe, two centuries ago, it has killed about 50 million people. In the time it takes you to read this article, another five people will have died from it. It is now mostly ignored in the west, but in other parts of the world, it has never gone away. While I will surely be able to offer my patients in England a coronavirus vaccine in a year or two, and while western health systems will be reinforced to be more ready for a potential future outbreak, I worry that we may repeat the mistakes of cholera: conquering coronavirus everywhere except for the poorest parts of the world. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is addressing the media now. He has been asked about US President Donald Trump’s comments late on Thursday. Trump said he had seen evidence that Covid-19 emerged from a laboratory in Wuhan, contradicting experts in his own administration who said it was not man made or genetically modified. Morrison said he has not seen any evidence to suggest that’s the case, but says Australia is still pushing for an independent investigation into the origin of the disease. What we have before us doesn’t suggest that that is the likely source. There’s nothing that we have that would suggest that that is the likely source but you can’t rule anything out in this scenario. He says the virus did originate in Wuhan, but “the most likely scenario that has been canvassed related to wildlife wet markets”. That is why Australia wants an “objective independent” investigation, he says. While that can’t be ruled out its not something we have seen any hard evidence of that that is the position. Morrison says an independent investigation would look at what happened and why it happened. So we can learn if something similar could happen in any part of the world so the world will be able to respond quicker. Because clearly in these cases time is everything. 1 million people have recovered. According to Johns Hopkins University data, more than a million people have now recovered from coronavirus infection, with the total currently at 1,014,524.Infections worldwide stand at 3,256,570.233,363 people have died in the pandemic so far. UK prime minister says the country now “past the peak”. Boris Johnson defended the decisions the UK government has taken. Speaking at the UK government’s daily press conference, Johnson said that the NHS has not been overwhelmed at any stage. US jobless toll amounts to 18.4% of working-age population.

Russian prime minister diagnosed with coronavirus. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has said he has been diagnosed with coronavirus and will self-isolate from the government in the country’s highest-profile case of the disease yet. Demand for coronavirus tests raises concerns over HIV and malaria Governments were caught out when Covid-19 hit, having overlooked the need to be able to test for new diseases because they were focused on drugs and vaccines for those they already knew about. Now there are fears that the rush to supply wealthier countries pressing for more tests may destabilise the fight against HIV, malaria and tuberculosis, illnesses that kill millions, mostly in low- and middle-income countries. “Some companies are planning to reduce or stop malaria, HIV and TB test production,” said Dr Catharina Boehme, the chief executive of the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (Find) and an adviser to the World Health Organization. “They are shifting their production to Covid-19 tests.” Boehme said companies could get about 18 cents for a rapid malaria test and $10 for a Covid-19 test. The Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria said it was concerned about “any action that might reduce the availability of tests or treatment for HIV, TB or malaria” The eels at a Japanese aquarium are lonely – and the aquarium staff are urging people to video call the creatures so that they do not grow too shy, AFP reports. The Sumida Aquarium, housed in the landmark Tokyo Skytree tower, has been closed since the start of March and its animals have become used to a largely human-free environment during the two-month calm. The “unprecedented situation” was having some unexpected downsides. “Creatures in the aquarium don’t see humans except keepers and they have started forgetting about humans,” it said on its Twitter account this week. “Garden eels in particular disappear into the sand and hide every time the keepers pass by.” That is causing difficulties for keepers trying to check on the health of the animals. In a bid to reacquaint the eels with humans, the aquarium is setting up five tablets facing the tank housing the delicate creatures, with eel enthusiasts asked to connect through iPhones or iPads via the FaceTime app. Once the video calls start, people are supposed to show their faces, wave and talk to the eels. But given the tender nature of the animals, callers are asked not to shout. Whistleblower complaint set to lift lid on Trump pressure to push untried drug Donald Trump’s musing over whether cleaning people’s lungs with disinfectant might treat the coronavirus caused a furore but it may be the US president’s pushing of anti-malarial drugs that does far more lasting damage to his administration. There is building anticipation over the content of an upcoming whistleblower complaint by Dr Rick Bright, who last week was abruptly removed as the head of the federal government office working on a vaccine for Covid-19. It is understood that Bright is still working on the details of the complaint before lodging it with the Department of Health and Human Services’ inspector general. Bright, a vaccines expert, has claimed he was removed as head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (Barda) because he resisted an effort to expand the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat Covid-19. The drugs, approved to treat malaria, have yet to be proven effective for this new use but have been repeatedly promoted by Trump, who has called them a “game-changer”. Tony Allen, legendary drummer and Afrobeat co-founder, dies aged 79 The Nigerian drummer Tony Allen, who is credited with creating Afrobeat along with his old bandmate Fela Kuti, died suddenly at the age of 79 in Paris on Thursday, his manager said. “We don’t know the exact cause of death,” Eric Trosset said, adding it was not linked to the coronavirus. “He was in great shape, it was quite sudden. I spoke to him at 1pm then two hours later he was sick and taken to Pompidou hospital, where he died.” Allen was the drummer and musical director of Fela Kuti’s band Africa ’70 in the 1960s and 70s, AFP reports. During that time the pair created Afrobeat, combining west African musical styles such as highlife and fuji music with US jazz and funk. Afrobeat went on to become one of the totemic genres of 20th century African music. Over Allen’s thrilling beat, Kuti laid out his revolutionary and pan-African message, which led him to become one of the abiding icons of the struggle for freedom across the continent. US President Donald Trump claims he has seen evidence of Covid-19 originating in a Wuhan lab. When asked at a press briefing if he has seen anything that gives you a “high degree of confidence” that coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, President Trump replied: “Yes, I have.” He added that he was “not allowed” to tell reporters what that evidence was: The White House let its 2-week-old economic reopening guidelines expire on Thursday as half of all US states forged ahead with their own strategies for easing restrictions on restaurants, retail and other businesses shuttered by the coronavirus crisis, Reuters reports. The enormous pressure on states to reopen, despite a lack of wide-scale virus testing and other safeguards urged by health experts, was highlighted in new Labor Department data showing some 30 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits since 21 March. The jobless toll amounts to more than 18.4% of the US working-age population, a level not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Physical separation of people - by closing schools, businesses and other places of social gatherings - remains the chief weapon against a highly contagious respiratory virus with no vaccine and no cure. But with economic pain reaching historic proportions, agitation to relax stay-at-home orders and mandatory workplace restrictions has mounted. For the second time in two weeks, hundreds of protesters - including armed militia group members - thronged Michigan’s state Capitol in Lansing demanding an end to Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s stay-at-home orders. The latest protest was sparked by the Democratic governor’s request, ignored by Republican lawmakers, to extend emergency powers she had invoked in a state hard hit by both the virus and closures to combat it. US President Donald Trump will leave the White House on Friday for the first time in a month when he travels to the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland. Trump will make the 70-mile (113 km) trip to Camp David on Friday evening, according to a schedule released by the White House on Thursday night. The schedule did not indicate how long Trump would stay at Camp David. Trump has been holding regular press events at the White House to highlight his administration’s efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Trump’s last trip away from the White House was on 28 March to Norfolk, Virginia, where he bid farewell to the Navy’s USNS Comfort hospital ship as it sailed to New York City to help take the pressure off civilian hospitals. Trump, who faces re-election in November, said on Wednesday he would visit Arizona next week for an “industry”-related event. Dan Collyns reports for the Guardian from Lima: Municipal authorities in Peru shut down a bustling street market in Lima on Thursday after a spot test for Covid-19 revealed one in five stallholders were infected with the virus. Out of 842 stallholders, 163 tested positive for the virus when a team of medics with military backup descended on the Caquéta food market in the working-class San Martín de Porres district in downtown Lima on Wednesday. Most Peruvians shop in open-air or covered food markets rather than supermarkets, where prices are more negotiable and markedly cheaper. But social distancing and sanitary guidelines are regularly flouted as punters haggle for bargains and stallholders make special offers to attract more customers. Markets were “hot spots” for Covid-19, Peru’s defence minister Walter Martos told journalists as he took part in the surprise inspection on Wednesday which revealed the virus’ increasing hold on the country’s population even as a stringent lockdown was nearing the end of its seventh week. “We know that this market is major convergence point and we have seen on our hotspots map that around this market there’s a large number of infected [people],” Martos said. Peru’s President Martín Vizcarra said it was a stern warning to maintain social distancing: “These 163 [stallholders] have to stay at home and keep their distance to avoid infecting others.” “When you go to buy potatoes or lettuce, you could be taking Covid-19 into your homes as an extra,” he said, using the Quechua word ‘Yapa’, which means a bonus portion offered to loyal customers. President Vizcarra has been praised by Peruvians for his swift and decisive response to Covid-19 enforcing one of the earliest lockdowns in Latin America. Nonetheless, the Andean country’s curve of infection has continued to rise and it had Latin America’s second-highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases after Brazil, with 36,976 confirmed cases and 1,051 deaths on Thursday. Poverty has been a major obstacle to the enforcement of the lockdown. Thousands have been trying to leave Lima in recent weeks, many saying they had to choose between hunger or homelessness in the city or the risk of exposure to Covid-19 as they attempt to return to their rural hometowns. Podcast: Who is Covid-19 killing? More than 26,000 people in the UK have officially been recorded as having died from the coronavirus. In this episode we look beyond the headline figure at who is dying – and hear from friends and family about the lives cut short: According to Johns Hopkins University data, more than a million people have now recovered from coronavirus infection, with the total currently at 1,014,524. Infections worldwide stand at 3,256,570. 233,363 people have died in the pandemic so far. Jacinda Ardern and her government soar in popularity during coronavirus crisis Charles Anderson reports for the Guardian: New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, reached an almost record-breaking approval rating while the country was in its strictest lockdown, according to a new leaked poll. The poll, which was conducted by UMR and leaked to the New Zealand Herald, shows that Ardern’s Labour party has reached 55% approval, while the opposition National party has dropped to 29% – its lowest rating in more than a decade. The Greens were on 5% and New Zealand First – Labour’s Coalition partners – on 6%. Ardern’s personal approval rating was 65% while the opposition leader, Simon Bridges, sat on 7%, according to the poll. It puts the PM close to her high of 70% approval in UMR polls during her term in office. The poll also shows that 78% of New Zealanders believe the country is heading in the right direction – the highest since 1991. Nature is healing: China reported 12 new coronavirus cases for 30 April, up from four a day earlier, data from the country’s health authority showed on Friday. Six of the cases were imported, the National Health Commission (NHC) said, up from four a day earlier. Of the domestic transmission cases, five were in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang and one in the northern region of Inner Mongolia. China reported no domestic transmission cases a day earlier. The NHC also reported 25 new asymptomatic cases for April 30, down from 33 a day earlier. The total number of confirmed cases in the country has reached 82,874. With no new deaths on Thursday, the toll remained at 4,633. Jair Bolsonaro says footballers in Brazil have ‘a small chance of dying’ from Covid-19 Brazil’s president Jair Bolsonaro wants to see football competitions restart soon despite the country’s high number of coronavirus cases, arguing that players are less likely to die from Covid-19 because of their physical fitness, Associated Press reports. Bolsonaro is one of the few world leaders that still downplays the risks brought by the coronavirus, which he has likened to “a little flu”. Most leagues in Brazil were suspended on 15 March. The Brazilian championship was scheduled to begin in May, but that looks unlikely as the country has become a coronavirus hot spot with more than 5,900 deaths. Doctors say the peak of the pandemic is expected to hit within two weeks. Brazil’s president said his new health minister will issue a suggestion that games return without any fans in the stadiums, but he acknowledged many players might be reluctant. “The decision to restart soccer is not mine, but we can help,” Bolsonaro said, adding he has spoken with Gremio coach Renato Portaluppi about the issue and was told that players are still worried about the virus. Neighbouring Argentina has already cancelled the rest of the 2019-2020 season because of the pandemic. France also decided to end the season, declaring Paris Saint-Germain as league champions on Thursday. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. India’s film industry, purveyor of song-and-dance spectacles to millions, will take at least two years to recover financially from the coronavirus pandemic, which is threatening big-ticket projects, putting at risk tens of thousands of jobs, Reuters reports. That was the sombre assessment of about a dozen top producers, distributors and actors from Bollywood, the movie industry in India’s commercial capital of Mumbai, during a video conference this week, one of the participants said. Such dim prospects, even after the lockdown is lifted, threaten the box-office takings that make up 60% of industry earnings, spurring producers to say big-budget films and extravagant shoots in foreign locations will be shelved. Bollywood has come to a grinding halt, with film production and theatres shut nationwide, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed a 40-day lockdown to curb the virus, which has infected 31,000 people and killed more than 1,000 in India. About 9,500 theatres are shut, and business at multiplexes and single-screen cinemas is unlikely to bounce back for weeks or even months, as infection fears linger and discretionary spending plunges. Shares in India’s two largest multiplex operators, PVR and INOX Leisure, have plunged more than 40% from all-time highs in late February. Brokerage Emkay also slashed its rating on both to “hold” from “buy”, saying they would suffer declines of more than 50% in visitor numbers, ticket sales, advertising revenue and food and beverage sales in fiscal 2020-21. Trump claims to have evidence coronavirus started in Chinese lab but offers no details Donald Trump claimed to have seen evidence to substantiate the unproven theory that the coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, despite US intelligence agencies’ conclusion that the virus was “not manmade or genetically modified”. “We’re going to see where it comes from,” Trump said at a White House event on Thursday. “We have people looking at it very, very strongly. Scientific people, intelligence people, and others. We’re going to put it all together. I think we will have a very good answer eventually. And China might even tell us.” Pressed to explain what evidence he had seen that the virus originated in a Chinese lab, Trump responded, “I can’t tell you that. I’m not allowed to tell you that.” Prior to the White House event, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the clearinghouse for the web of US spy agencies, issued a statement asserting that the intelligence community “concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified”. “The intelligence community will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan,” the statement added. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Ms Du, door sensors and me: life with a Beijing Covid-19 quarantine handler Every day for the last two weeks I have spoken with Ms Du, a mild-mannered, middle-aged woman who is my quarantine handler. She calls me in the morning to remind me to send her my temperature. She calls again if I forget to send the afternoon reading. She texts rose emojis, reminding me to “please cooperate” with the rules. If I open my door, equipped with a sensor, to put the rubbish in the hall or pick up a delivery, she immediately calls and reminds me to let her know beforehand. After returning from a reporting trip to Wuhan, I have been in strict self-isolation in my apartment in Beijing. Most days I get calls not just from Du but the local police station, perhaps checking the spelling of my name, someone from the health department asking about my travel history, or other representatives from the neighbourhood committee. They send messages reminding me to cover my mouth when coughing and not to “spit wherever you please”. The calls and questions, politely made, are constant and after a few days I already feel harried. A pink slip of paper with hearts taped to my door alerts my neighbours how long my quarantine should last: France will contribute €50 per person towards bicycle repairs after a nationwide coronavirus lockdown ends on 11 May, taking an innovative step to encourage cycling and reduce overcrowding in metros and buses, where it is hard to practice the social distancing required to prevent virus transmission. Environment Minister Elisabeth Borne announced on Thursday a €20 million ($22 million) plan for repairing bicycles, installing temporary bike parking spaces and financing cycling coaching sessions. Borne said the government will also accelerate a programme allowing employers to cover up to €400 of travel costs of staff who cycle to work. “We want this period to be a new stage towards a cycling culture and we want the bicycle to be the queen of deconfinement,” Borne said on her Twitter feed. Remdesivir: five Australian hospitals to receive experimental coronavirus drug The US pharmaceutical company Gilead is finalising the location of five hospitals in Australia to receive the highly sought-after experimental Covid-19 drug remdesivir. The only confirmed location is St Vincent’s hospital in Sydney, a major tertiary hospital and the centre of many of the New South Wales outbreak areas. A NSW Health spokeswoman confirmed the health department “has been engaging with Gilead on gaining access to the drug for Covid-19 patients”. The news comes as the doctor informing the Covid-19 response in the White House, the immunologist Dr Anthony Fauci, promoted preliminary findings from a joint Gilead and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases study that suggested remdesivir could improve recovery time of patients. His comments have revived global hope in the drug, with no treatments now available for the virus. The death rate among British black Africans and British Pakistanis from coronavirus in English hospitals is more than 2.5 times that of the white population, according to stark analysis by the Institute of Fiscal Studies. The highly respected thinktank also found that deaths of people from a black Caribbean background were 1.7 times higher than for white Britons. NHS England figures published last week showed that hospital deaths per 100,000 among British people of a black Caribbean background were three times the equivalent number among the majority white British population. However, unlike previous analysis, the IFS research, published on Friday, strips out the role of age, gender and geography and shows that they do not explain the disparities. The first two weeks of the coronavirus lockdown triggered an unprecedented rise in food bank use as the economy was hit and household incomes plunged, data from hundreds of emergency food aid charities reveals. The Trussell Trust, the UK’s biggest food bank network, said it experienced its busiest ever period after lockdown was announced on 23 March, when it issued 50,000 food parcels in the space of a week, almost double its usual volume. A similar picture emerged from the Independent Food Aid Network (Ifan), which said its food banks recorded a 59% increase in demand for emergency food support between February and March – 17 times higher than the same period a year ago. Just a donkey named Earl playing with a purple ball: Here’s the full story on the armed protestors in Michigan: American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines said Thursday they will soon require passengers to cover their faces during flights, following the lead of JetBlue Airways, Reuters reports. The move comes as airlines big and small contemplate how to comply with social-distancing recommendations in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. Most flights are nearly empty these days air travel is down 95% from a year ago, and the average domestic flight has 17 passengers, according to industry figures. This week, JetBlue became the first US airline to announce it will require passengers to wear face coverings during flights, starting next week. Wearing a face covering isn’t about protecting yourself, its about protecting those around you, said JetBlue President Joanna Geraghty. This is the new flying etiquette. Earlier Thursday, Frontier Airlines said that it would begin requiring masks 8 May. Delta and United announced they would make masks mandatory starting Monday. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Thursday that downstate New York’s entire public transport system (which includes New York City and Long Island) would be disinfected every 24 hours. He also said he would need an “army” of between 6,400 and 17,000 people to trace the contacts of people who have tested positive for the novel coronavirus as part of a strategy to limit outbreaks. Cuomo said that former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg would, in coordination with Johns Hopkins University, oversee the recruitment and training of these “contact tracers” and make the program available to governments worldwide. Hundreds of protesters, some armed, gathered inside Michigan’s state capitol on Thursday as state lawmakers debated the Democratic governor’s request to extend her emergency powers to combat coronavirus. A tightly packed crowd of protesters, some carrying rifles, attempted to enter the floor of the legislative chamber, and were held back by a line of state police and capitol staff, according to video footage posted by local journalists. “Let us in! Let us in!” the protesters chanted, as they stood shoulder-to-shoulder inside the statehouse. Few of them were wearing face masks. Some of the protesters shouted anti-government slogans, including comparing Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer to Hitler. One Democratic state lawmaker posted a photograph of men with rifles standing in a gallery yelling down at lawmakers below. “Some of my colleagues who own bullet proof vests are wearing them,” state senator Dayna Polehanki, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter. A spokeswoman for the Michigan senate minority leader that at least one lawmaker was wearing a bullet-proof vest. The footage from the protest sparked strong reactions from many Americans. One Black Lives Matter organizer commented on the striking difference between the reaction to unarmed black Americans protesting police violence and armed white Americans protesting against public health measures.

UK prime minister Boris Johnson has announced that the country is “past the peak”. Johnson – who has just returned to work after a bout of coronavirus, and the birth of his son – also said that the NHS has not been overwhelmed at any stage. US president Donald Trump meanwhile has claimed to have evidence that Covid-19 originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, despite his own government experts saying the virus was “not manmade or genetically modified”. US intelligence agencies have been under pressure to link coronavirus to Chinese labs, the Guardian’s Patrick Wintour reports: Here are the most important developments from the last few hours: UK prime minister says the country now “past the peak”. Boris Johnson defended the decisions the UK government has taken. Speaking at the UK government’s daily press conference, Johnson said that the NHS has not been overwhelmed at any stage. Trump claims he has seen evidence of Covid-19 originating in Wuhan lab. When asked if he has seen anything that gives you a “high degree of confidence” that coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, President Trump replied: “Yes, I have.” His own government experts say the virus was ‘not manmade or genetically modified’. US intelligence agencies have been under pressure to link coronavirus to Chinese labs. Germany eases lockdown measures.

Data from the labour office also showed the unemployment rate increased to 5.8%, up from 5% in March, as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.
92	As Australia’s coronavirus outbreak continues, a lot of important news has slipped under the radar. From Angus Taylor v Clover Moore, to a looming byelection, and back to the Taylor family’s Grasslands saga, here are the stories you may have missed over the past week. And here is last week’s list of stories – in case you missed those. New details emerge in Angus Taylor document saga After police told New South Wales parliament there was no evidence Angus Taylor’s office had a downloaded an altered City of Sydney document from the council’s website, the minister’s response was to make a distinction between “downloading” and “accessing”. Last year, Taylor used the false document, which contained incorrect figures on council travel, to attack the City of Sydney mayor, Clover Moore, and maintained he had accessed from the council’s website. It emerged this week that NSW police had told the state parliament there was no evidence the documents had been downloaded from the council website, leading to Taylor’s distinction between “download” and “accessing”. Moore, who was also concerned by reports Taylor was not interviewed by police, said it was “nearly beyond belief” Taylor had still not explained the origin of the altered document. Obama White House team watched Gillard’s misogyny speech – a lot In an interview with the podcast A Rational Fear, Obama White House adviser Ben Rhodes revealed the former president’s team would often watch Julia Gillard’s misogyny speech when they were “really annoyed” with Tony Abbott. Rhodes, Obama’s former deputy national security adviser, said the team was often frustrated with the former Coalition PM over his positions on climate change, particularly during the lead-up to the Paris agreement. He did not say whether the former president was among the viewers of Gillard’s speech. In the podcast, Rhodes also revealed how Obama “went way off the script” to blast the Abbott government during a visit to Brisbane for the G20 summit. Investigation finds Taylor-linked company poisoned endangered grasslands A much-anticipated report by the federal environment department concluded a company part-owned by Angus Taylor illegally poisoned critically endangered grasslands in the New South Wales Monaro region. Jam Land, which Taylor part-owns with his brother Richard, was ordered to restore 103 hectares of native grassland three and a half years after poisoning the land on a property in Corrowong. The company avoided a fine and criminal finding, and the company intends to have the decision reviewed. Angus Taylor said he has no direct or controlling interest in the company. Labor the Greens have called for Taylor to resign, citing meetings he sought with senior environment officials about the grasslands while the review was under way. He denies any wrongdoing. McKenzie’s sports grants submission fails to explain role PM’s office Bridget McKenzie, who quit as sports minister while engulfed in the sports grants scandal, lodged a bulky response to a Senate inquiry that still failed to explain the role of Scott Morrison’s office in rejigging sports funding on the day the last election was called. McKenzie insisted she was not aware of applications for funds being colour-coded according to the party representing the electorate. However, it is likely the former Nationals deputy leader will be directly questioned on matters by the committee next month. Leaked report shows government told to ban fracking in Lake Eyre basin The Guardian obtained a leaked report that revealed the Queensland government was urged by experts to ban fracking in the environmentally sensitive Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre basin. The government had blocked report’s release after granting gas companies new exploration rights, infuriating conservation groups who called for the findings to be made public. Labor MPs quits, setting up Covid byelection Labor MP Mike Kelly, the member for Eden-Monaro, announced he would resign from parliament, citing health issues incurred while he was a serviceman. It sets up a federal byelection contest during the Covid-19 pandemic that could be expected to canvass the government’s response to both the pandemic and the recent bushfires which ravaged the area, as well as other local issues. Labor is expected to preselect the mayor of Bega Valley shire, while the NSW deputy premier, Nationals leader John Barilaro, is considering whether to throw his hat in the ring.
93	California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, promised “meaningful” adjustments to stay-at-home orders in the coming days as thousands of protesters gathered across the state in defiance of the lockdown. Demonstrations took place from the capital of Sacramento to San Francisco and San Diego, while large crowds turned out in Orange county’s Huntington Beach, a recent flashpoint after Newsom ordered beaches there to close. Newsom said that the state was “getting very close” to making changes that would affect how businesses, including restaurants, could operate, and urged residents to be patient. He said the announcement of the changes would come in “days, not weeks”. Nearly 3,000 people protested in Huntington Beach on Friday, the city’s police chief told the OC Register. The Huntington Beach protest followed the closure of beaches in Orange county after a weekend when tens of thousands of people hit the sands south of Los Angeles county, which had been closed for weeks. Newsom scolded local residents for defying the spirit of the stay-at-home order, and responded by ordering all beaches in the county to temporarily close. “I served in the army and fought tyrants and dictators overseas and this has gone too far,” one protester told the Los Angeles Times. “I didn’t do that to come back here and live under a tyrant in my own country.” Many of the Huntington Beach protesters brought their children along with them, the Los Angeles Times reported, with one protester saying he had come with his wife and three young children because it was important to show that the protesters are “normal people”. In Sacramento, the state’s capital, a packed crowd of protesters faced off with lines of riot cops in a tense and chaotic protest on Friday afternoon. “Traitors!” the protesters screamed at police, according to a livestream of the protest produced by reporters from the Sacramento Bee. Some protesters held signs promoting anti-vaccine conspiracies or questioning whether the coronavirus is real, while others protested the closure of businesses during the pandemic, arguing that all jobs are essential. Almost none of the protesters were wearing masks, according to reporters and photographers at the scene. The California Highway Patrol (CHP) had announced that it would be barring protests at the capitol because of a lack of social distancing by participants at a previous rally, but protesters gathered on the steps of the building regardless, chanting “Whose house? Our house!” The CHP repeatedly ordered the protesters to disperse, the Sacramento Bee reported, and by 3pm, a line of law enforcement in full riot gear had slowly pushed protesters back from the capitol steps towards the street. Other protests were smaller: only about 150 people rallied in San Francisco, and hundreds in San Diego, according to local news reports. The rallies across California against Newsom’s stay-at-home orders came as a rural county in northern California became the first to defy statewide orders by allowing nonessential businesses to reopen and diners to eat in restaurants. Modoc county, in the state’s far north-east, near Oregon, had no Covid-19 cases, a local official told the Associated Press. In his Friday news conference, Newsom said he empathized with the protesters’ “frustration and concern and deeply understandable anxiety about the economy and the fate and future of their families”, and said that the state was trying to work closely to respond to the concerns of more rural areas of the state. “We’re paying attention to you,” Newsom said, speaking to the state’s rural residents. “We recognize the economic pain.” But the availability of testing for coronavirus had also lagged in rural areas, Newsom said later, highlighting the dangers of reopening the economy too quickly. Asked about his response to protesters calling him a tyrant and a fascist, Newsom simply urged Californians to “take care of yourself”. “Wear a face covering,” he said. “Do justice to physical distancing. You don’t want to contract this disease.” People who showed no symptoms could still spread the virus, Newsom warned the protesters. “Protect yourself. Protect your family. Protect your kids, your parents.” The governor passed on responsibility to local law enforcement officials for dealing with the fraught question of whether protesters who were violating social distancing guidelines should be arrested. He said he could not possibly monitor and respond to every protest happening across the state. “I have confidence in local law enforcement, incredible confidence,” Newsom said. In Sacramento, where many protesters were flouting social distancing guidelines, at least one person had been arrested, according to the Sacramento Bee. Newsom defended his announcement that changes in shelter-in-place would come in “many days”, rather than weeks, and said that the move was motivated by the data, not just by the political resistance bubbling up across the state. More than 2,000 people have died of coronavirus in California so far, including 91 people in the previous day, but the number of patients in intensive care units stayed flat, and the total number of hospitalizations had fallen slightly, both signs of progress justifying a move towards some changes in the emergency order, Newsom said. But, “We can screw all that up and set all that back by making bad decisions,” Newsom said, adding that these positive signed are only possible “because people have done an incredible job in their physical distancing,” he said. “Thousands of people congregating together, not practicing social distancing or physical distancing,” could undermine the current progress in preventing the spread of the virus, the governor said. “If we can avoid that, we can get to the other side with modifications a lot quicker.” Agencies contributed reporting
94	US regulators have allowed the emergency use of the experimental drug remdesivir, which appears to help some coronavirus patients recover faster. It is the first drug shown to help fight Covid-19, which has killed more than 230,000 people worldwide. Donald Trump announced the news on Friday at the White House alongside Stephen Hahn, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner, who said the drug would be available for patients hospitalized with Covid-19. The president said the approval represented a “very promising situation” in the country’s fight against coronavirus, and Dr Deborah Birx added, “I think this really illustrates what can happen in such a short time.” The emergency approval comes days after Dr Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, expressed cautious optimism about the results of a remdesivir drug trial. “The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,” Fauci said earlier this week. “What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus.” The FDA acted after preliminary results from a government-sponsored study showed that Gilead Sciences’s remdesivir shortened the time to recovery by 31%, or about four days on average, for hospitalized Covid-19 patients. The study of 1,063 patients is the largest and most strict test of the drug and included a comparison group that received just usual care so remdesivir’s effects could be rigorously evaluated. Those given the drug were able to leave the hospital in 11 days on average versus 15 days for the comparison group. The drug also might be reducing deaths, although that’s not certain from the partial results revealed so far. Fauci said the drug would become a new standard of care for severely ill Covid-19 patients like those in this study. The drug has not been tested on people with milder illness, and currently is given through an IV in a hospital. The FDA authorized the drug under its emergency powers to quickly speed experimental drugs, tests and other medical products to patients during public health crises. In normal times the FDA requires “substantial evidence” of a drug’s safety and effectiveness, usually through one or more large, rigorously controlled patient studies. But during public health emergencies the agency can waive those standards, simply requiring that an experimental drug’s potential benefits outweigh its risks. No drugs are approved now for treating the coronavirus, and remdesivir will still need formal approval. The FDA can convert the drug’s status to full approval if Gilead or other researchers provide additional data of remdesivir’s safety and effectiveness. Use of the drug will be authorized for adults or children who are hospitalized with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 and whose condition is “severe”, meaning they have low blood oxygen levels, need oxygen therapy or are on a mechanical ventilator, the FDA said. “Based on evaluation of the emergency use authorization criteria and the scientific evidence available, it was determined that it is reasonable to believe that remdesivir may be effective in treating Covid-19, and that, given there are no adequate, approved or available alternative treatments, the known and potential benefits to treat this serious or life-threatening virus currently outweigh the known and potential risks of the drug’s use,” the FDA said in its statement. The emergency use authorization (EUA) also includes information about possible side effects, which include “increased levels of liver enzymes, which may be a sign of inflammation or damage to cells in the liver; and infusion-related reactions, which may include low blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, sweating and shivering”. It also notes that there may be other serious side effects that have not been discovered yet. The EUA requires hospitals to monitor patients’ liver enzymes through blood tests before the treatment is started and every day that treatment is ongoing. Patients who receive the drug will be provided with a fact sheet, which is available here. The drug is administered through an IV once a day for up to 10 days. Hahn said the drug’s approval for emergency use represented “an important clinical advance” in the fight against coronavirus. Daniel O’Day, the Gilead CEO, said Friday that his company has already ramped up production of the drug and hopes to make millions of treatment courses available by the end of the year. “I think it’s important to note that this is a medicine for the most severe patients,” O’Day told the Today show. “What we see here is really, of course, not a cure but a very, very significant and important treatment for patients.” Agencies contributed reporting
95	It is hard to imagine the body-blow of the “dining table revolution”, which the Chinese government is now encouraging as a means to hold down Covid-19 infection rates by reducing general physical contact. Designated serving spoons, no double-dipping, even individual portions rather than family-size sharing platters, have all been floated as part of a new need for safety. When you think of the banquet style of a classic Chinese meal, a table heaving with dishes so varied and communal that you need the table to spin if you want to get round it, the lonely portions of the solitary eater are going to seem like quite a comedown. European cuisine may also struggle to adjust. The convention of individual portions, known as the Russian service, came to prominence in the 1810s in mainland Europe (though much later in Britain) and was basically a way to prove how rich you were (because you could afford the servants – it is much more labour-intensive to bring dishes out one person at a time). The French service that came before it, tables laden with sharing plates, was effortlessly blown away by the emotional appeal of ostentation. This century, though, the huge platter has come back to prominence. Spanish tapas took off and spread its conventions (lots of tiny, shared plates) across many different cuisines. Italian cuisine has its bursting, shareable antipasto tradition. There was a period when it became incredibly déclassé to order anything just for yourself. And that’s before you even start to think about the all-inclusive buffet, beloved of cruises and weddings, where it is far cheaper and easier to feed large numbers of people with large sharing dishes than individually. Meanwhile, the rise of the gastropub over the past three decades has forced the realisation that formality – far from being the whole point of dinner – makes most of us feel awkward. Steadily, food tended towards a more family‑table style, large shared dishes where you served yourself. It’s not quite so much of a hygiene faux pas as tapas, so long as you use the designated spoon, but it doesn’t feel quite as safe as having your own plate and sticking to it. In short: we’ve all got quite a handbrake turn to perform, with the obvious rider that this is the least of our problems.
96	Early on Thursday morning Mark Fahey received a call that hit him “right between the eyes”. His mother, 76-year-old Ann Fahey, had been found collapsed on the floor of her room at the Newmarch House aged-care home in Penrith, in Sydney’s west, where she is a resident. Nurses feared she’d fallen out of bed, but when he spoke to her on the phone Ann told Fahey that after waking during the night she’d felt tired and dizzy and had laid down on the floor. “She had a 38.9 degree temperature so she was a bit off with the fairies, but all she kept saying was that she was tired,” he told the Guardian. “She just wanted to get off the phone and sleep.” By early afternoon staff confirmed what he’d feared: more than a month after the aged-care home went into lockdown and after two previous tests came back negative, his mother was one of three new confirmed cases of Covid-19 recorded at Newmarch. “I don’t understand. She was a model patient, did everything right, she’s shut herself in her room the entire time,” Fahey said. “There’s shitloads going through my mind. Why is it still happening? … How can they still be getting new cases after this long. I mean it’s not rocket science. It’s coming in from the outside because she’s been meticulous following all their guidelines.” The Covid-19 outbreak at Newmarch House, which has so far claimed the lives of 13 residents and threatens to overtake the Ruby Princess as Australia’s deadliest wave of the virus, began when a part-time carer worked six shifts while symptomatic and infectious. Newmarch had already been in a type of lockdown before then. On 18 March the national cabinet announced rules placing strict limitations on the number of visitors allowed inside aged-care homes. The rules meant visits were limited to two adult visitors at once a day inside a resident’s room. But when the staff member returned a positive diagnosis for Covid-19 on 11 April after being told she had come into contact with a confirmed case, a flood of cases within the home were quickly discovered. On 12 April the first resident returned a positive result for the virus. Six days later a 93-year-old man became the first to die. Despite efforts to isolate every resident and the federal government’s introduction of surge workers from a private company, Aspen Medical, to help contain the outbreak, infections have risen steadily. There are now 61 confirmed cases of Covid-19 related to Newmarch House, including 24 staff and 37 residents. On Wednesday a 74-year-old man became the 13th resident to die and on Saturday, two further staff members tested positive. New South Wales health officials have said the staff member who first became infected had experienced only extremely mild symptoms before testing positive, and the state’s chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, told media the woman was “mortified” when she discovered she had the virus. In any case, the spiralling death toll inside the aged care home has left the families of some residents furious with Newmarch’s operator, Anglicare. Families have been gathering outside the facility to hold a vigil every afternoon, with some lucky enough to catch a glimpse of their relative through a window. This week, a group of family members published an open letter to Anglicare’s chief executive, Grant Millard, saying communication from within the home had been “far from satisfactory”. “Phones went unanswered day after day. Calls were not returned. Details about our individual loved ones were not provided regularly,” the letter read. “The residents were reporting that the care was inadequate and they were becoming distressed. Many of them were sick and frightened and did not have regular access to their family on the outside which increased their levels of anxiety as well as ours.” Some family members say Anglicare has improved its communication. After the NSW opposition leader, Jodi McKay, held a press conference outside the home on Wednesday, Louise Payne, who has led much of the campaign to improve communication with families, said she’d received a phone call from Millard and been able to have a window visit with her mother. “It was wonderful. It sounds such a little thing but I was absolutely elated because it’s been two weeks of hell not knowing how she is,” she said. “There are no guarantees, but it’s looking like mum might be one of the ones to beat this. She’s nearly 90, so if she does it’s amazing.” Others, however, are losing patience. Elizabeth Lane, from Windsor, in Sydney’s west, takes comfort in knowing her mother, Rose Davies, 84, is still making life hard for the nurses in Newmarch. “Mum’s always been a very difficult individual, so when they say she’s being a bit of a handful I think: ‘Thank god, she’s still OK.’ If they told me she was being nice and cooperative I’d know something was wrong,” she said. Davies lives in the palliative wing of Newmarch, and suffers from dementia. She has not tested positive for Covid-19, but Lane’s voice cracks as she talks about the toll more than a month without seeing her family is taking on her mother. “It’s heartbreaking to think this is how she’s going to end her days,” she said. “I know this is horrible for everyone. People have already lost their family, but I can’t help thinking we may have lost our parents too. By the time we get to speak to them again, they’re not going to know who we are. For dementia patients having no contact, no stimulation, it all exacerbates their decline.” Lane said that when the outbreak occurred, she “naively” trusted that Anglicare would manage to “get on top of this”. But as the weeks have passed, her patience with the lack of communication from the home has worn out. When the aged-care home provided mobile phones for residents, Lane said she discovered her mother’s hadn’t been set up for her. A number she had been calling in the nurse’s station for updates was abruptly disconnected with no warning. “I’ve got six or seven numbers that I just call over and over until someone answers,” she said. She was finally able to see her mother through a window on Friday, but only after she contacted the federal minister for aged care, Richard Colbeck. “He called me and said he’d sort it out for me,” she said. “I don’t blame the staff, this has been an absolute shitstorm, there’s no better word for it. The whole world has had trouble dealing with it. But I just think there hasn’t been a real emergency plan in place and everything feels really reactive, even now.” Matthew Fowler, whose father Lionel has so far tested negative to Covid-19 twice, says he has been frustrated at Anglicare’s management of the situation. “It’s absolutely appalling that a worker who was sick was allowed to work six shifts there.” On Friday, he joined the daily vigil outside the home, and said he was glad to see Anglicare had placed a senior chaplain for gathering family for the first time. “It should have happened from the first day.” As federal and state governments coordinate local health districts and surge staffing assistance to Newmarch, health authorities are struggling to understand how the virus is still spreading inside the heavily controlled facility. In a statement, Anglicare said the new infections had occurred “despite us having strict procedures and enforced infection control practices in place”. “These new cases may reflect historical transmissions and reflect the rigorous and ongoing testing at Newmarch House. We will be investigating further how this has occurred,” the statement read. On Friday, when unveiling a national code for aged-care facility visitation, Colbeck said the government’s assistance to Newmarch meant it was “effectively running a mini-hospital within the facility”, but did not criticise Anglicare for its response to the situation. “There has been no limit on the resources made available to Newmarch in managing this,” he said. “This is not a finger-pointing or a blame exercise, it’s a very, very unfortunate circumstance where somebody who was asymptomatic, but obviously had a very high viral load, was in contact with people for six days, residents and staff, and this is the very, very tragic outcome of that.” On Saturday, Chant announced a further infection control review of Newmarch launched after a wave of infections this week had shown breaches of safety protocol “amongst particularly the staff”. “And that’s obviously a concern. There have been some elements where consistent application of infection control practice has not occurred,” Chant said. For the family of some residents, the situation is become increasingly desperate. “I sort of lost my temper with it all the other night a bit. I just think, can’t they bring the army in, get them all out of this toxic cesspit and take them somewhere else,” Mark Fahey said. “You only get one mum. As soon as I found out, my first instinct is just to go and get her, but you can’t get into the joint. It’s the worst place in Australia to be unfortunately, and I can’t get her out.”
97	A series of rearranged Classic trials and Pattern races have been scheduled for the last two weekends in May if racing is allowed to resume later this month, as the British Horseracing Authority seeks to rescue as much of the Flat season as possible once the current lockdown is eased. The schedule, drawn up by members of the Flat Pattern Committee, would see the Greenham Stakes and Craven Stakes, two major trials for the 2,000 Guineas, taking place on different days over the weekend of 23-24 May. The Nell Gwyn Stakes and Fred Darling Stakes, trials for the 1,000 Guineas, would be staged the same weekend, along with five more Group Three events including the Brigadier Gerard Stakes and the Sagaro Stakes, a trial for the Ascot Gold Cup. The weekend of 30-31 May, meanwhile, would include the Lockinge Stakes, the first Group One of the season, along with the Group Two Yorkshire Cup, and the Dante Stakes, the most significant domestic trial for the Derby. The 2,000 Guineas and 1,000 Guineas would then be run on the weekend of 6-7 June, along with the Group One Coronation Cup, which would normally be part of that weekend’s Derby Festival at Epsom. If the BHA is able to proceed with this “best-case” scenario, Royal Ascot would remain in its traditional position in mid-June, starting on 16 June, with the Derby and Oaks being staged in early July. Sunday’s tips by Chris Cook Those of us who are still learning about Hong Kong racing will be interested in the extent to which team tactics form a part of the action there, which should become clear in the running of Sunday morning’s Queen Mother Memorial Cup. Tony Cruz will saddle the likely favourite, Helene Leadingstar (6.30), whose four opponents are all from the John Moore stable. Helene Leadingstar (6.30) is the “now” horse, having finally got his first two wins in Hong Kong after a couple of years’ trying. This step up to a mile and a half must help a horse who won the South Australia Derby in 2018, when known as Leicester. Sunday morning’s card will be shown live on Sky Sports Racing. 5.30 This “Griffin” race, featuring horses that had not competed before arriving in Hong Kong, has almost exactly the same cast as one that took place three weeks ago. Smiling Face was fancied that day but reared up in the stalls. Runner-up to a useful-looking rival, the horse has hardly anything in hand over Chancheng Prince or Sea Monarch on that showing but that loss of composure may have cost him. If he behaves better on this second outing, he can justify the faith shown by punters that day. 6.00 Demons Rock seems likely to be a short price for a horse that hasn’t won since he was a two-year-old entire with Tom Dascombe in the summer of 2017. A compelling case is hard to make for any of these but Fairy Floss could be worth chancing, since his only previous start on dirt was also the closest he has come to success. 7.00 It has taken time but Fabulous Eight now looks like making good on the promise he showed in late 2018. His third place last month was easily his best effort since then and he can be marked up a bit, having twice met trouble in running. From an in-form stable and with João Moreira aboard, he is sure to be a warm order. 7.30 Others have more obvious claims but there was a lot to like about Mig Energy’s fifth place at Happy Valley just over a fortnight ago. He wasn’t beaten far that day after chasing too hot a pace, while the pair who forced it finished out the back. Hopefully a wide draw means he will avoid getting drawn into an early pace battle and, if so, he has the talent to get involved. 8.00 The tactically versatile Excel Delight is perhaps best suited by creeping into contention, which was how he scored here in February. He nearly pulled off the same trick a fortnight ago when beaten by inches by a classy young rival and will be unlucky to find something of similar talent in this field. 8.35 This drop in class is interesting for Monster Kaka, who has dropped 20lb since starting in Hong Kong a year ago and now looks well treated and ready to win. He was a major eye-catcher when storming into third place a fortnight ago and the extra furlong should help. The lightly raced Snow Airjet may also be worth a second look. 9.05 Rather like his days with James Fanshawe, Enzemble has taken time to put it all together in Hong Kong but he won with a degree of authority when last seen. This belated return to 10 furlongs must be a help to him and he can see off Defining Moment, who has been helped by the visor but now makes a step up in class. 9.35 Party Genius is an obvious chance, but he’ll be a short price and is drawn wide again. Spicy Grill should be available at much bigger odds but is also going the right way and was beaten less than four lengths three weeks ago, after traffic problems. That was easily the best of his four runs and his first attempt at this trip. He should have more to offer. 10.10 Some interest in Good For You seems likely but Elite Patch appeals most, having won a couple of times in this grade in early winter before a step up in class made life tougher. 10.45 The cheekpieces have helped Everyone’s Joy, who gradually worked his way into form before running down a hot favourite here last month. Chad Schofield keeps the ride and they set the standard, with a handy inside draw.

99	With more than £45m in the bank, 1917 is the year’s highest-grossing film in UK cinemas by a country mile, and as things stand, nothing’s breaking that record for the foreseeable future. If Sam Mendes’s big, punchy first world war epic was still on your to-see list when cinemas succumbed to lockdown in March, its digital release on Monday will come as a welcome quarantine care package. You will have missed an opportunity, though. Justly rewarded at the Oscars for Roger Deakins’s propulsive, sleight-of-hand cinematography and its layered, pummelling sound design, 1917 remains involving and impressive in any format, but had more immediate sensory grandeur on the big screen. Setting aside the commotion over its smartly executed illusion of being shot in two long takes, Mendes’s film is a man-on-a-mission tale in a simple, even classical vein, thinly characterised in ways that somewhat curtail its emotional impact. The technical showmanship here isn’t mere window-dressing. It’s what makes the film distinguished and immersive in the canon of films about the first world war – which rarely gets such elaborate cinematic treatment, at least relative to the ongoing parade of pyrotechnically enhanced second world war spectaculars. Perhaps it’s the knowledge of all that deathly bravado to come, however, that gives an additional sense of piercing tragedy to the greatest first world war films – many of which are available to stream, if you feel like situating Mendes’s blockbuster in context. Lewis Milestone’s All Quiet on the Western Front (BFI Player) is, astonishingly, 90 years old this year, and hasn’t dated a whit, neither in its strikingly crisp, clean, unadorned film-making, nor in its tough, unsentimental perspective. It remains pretty much the master template for any anti-war film, its non-partisan depiction of daily life for German soldiers in the trenches as vividly harrowing in its way as Mendes’s missive from the opposite side. That it deservedly won the best picture Oscar in 1930 is all the more remarkable when you consider that the same award went the year before to Wings (Amazon), a sweeping, silent action romance that seems largely enamoured of its WWI airman derring-do until its slightly ungainly “war kills” coda. It’s smashing, old-school entertainment, but hasn’t aged nearly as gracefully. See also Howard Hughes’s ludicrously glamorous planes-and-dames spectacle Hell’s Angels (1930), available on the Internet Archive. It’s not much of a history lesson, but it’s a glistening romp. More stately decorum returned in A Farewell to Arms (Amazon Prime), a handsome, stirring 1932 adaptation of the Hemingway novel that accrues a genuine lump-in-throat gravity to its doomed romance between Gary Cooper’s dashing ambulance officer and Helen Hayes’s Red Cross nurse. Still, Hollywood depictions of the war veered ever more toward grandstanding and patriotism: see Howard Hawks’s flawed but fascinating Sergeant York (Chili), a war-hero biopic caught between its subject’s anti-war principles and conservative cheerleading that spoke very much to the moment in 1941. It would take the French to bring some cynicism to proceedings: Jean Renoir’s peerless La Grande Illusion (1937), currently streaming on Mubi, still cuts deep with its humane, complex comedy, astutely threading class solidarity through opposing factions in its prisoner-of-war escape saga. After that, it wasn’t until Stanley Kubrick’s still-breathtaking Paths of Glory (1957; iTunes) that the Great War got a cast-iron classic film, with a portrayal of trench warfare as unflinching as its thorny examination of the moral consequences. In 1981, Gallipoli, Peter Weir’s majestic, sun-scorched study (Amazon Prime) of Australian soldiers swallowed whole in the eponymous allied war campaign, brought a fresh national perspective to a genre dominated by American and European points of view. Recent decades have brought fewer essential first world war dramas, unless you count Steven Spielberg’s claggy, custardy War Horse adaptation (2011), or a serviceable but standard-issue 2017 remake of that old chestnut Journey’s End. Over both of those – indeed, over 1917 – it’s James Kent’s exquisite, underrated 2014 Vera Brittain biopic Testament of Youth (Amazon Prime) that I return to. A rare, bracing treasure for its foregrounding of female perspective in a tale of war, it has the soaring swirl and plunging sadness of the very best. More titles new to streaming this week The Beach Bum (Blue Finch, 18) Harmony Korine’s first all-out stoner comedy never found a Spring Breakers-level following, but it’s mellow and enveloping if you’re in the mood, so to speak. If you’re not, at least the ice-cream tones of Benoît Debie’s cinematography make it a beautiful indulgence. Richard Jewell (Warner Bros, 15) The businesslike nature of Clint Eastwood’s recent films works to the benefit of this gripping, dourly ambiguous biopic of the security guard caught up in the Atlanta Olympic Park bombing. The script wobbles, particularly on its gender politics, but Paul Walter Hauser and Kathy Bates are superb. Water Lilies (Mubi, 15) With Portrait of a Lady on Fire having woken up a wider audience to Céline Sciamma’s brilliance, the time is right for Mubi to stream her shimmering 2007 debut – long unavailable in any format – which demonstrated her sensual command of the female gaze early on. The Family Way (StudioCanal, 12) This re-release of the 1966 Britcom about newlyweds trapped under the same roof as the groom’s family certainly makes for timely quarantine viewing. The film itself is a charming time capsule, no longer edgy but gently wry, buoyed by Paul McCartney’s score.

102	Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Kim Jong-un reportedly appears in public The North Korean leader Kim Jong-un makes his first public appearance in nearly three weeks, according to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency. His absence amid the pandemic led to speculation, though South Korean and US officials have stressed their belief he was not ill and could simply have been sheltering from the outbreak. Global number of infections passes 3.3m At least 3,334,416 people have been infected and at least 237,943 have died around the world since the pandemic began, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins University. The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the outbreak due to suspected underreporting, as well as differing testing and statistical regimes. Trump now hopes for fewer than 100,000 US deaths The president offers an increasingly bleak picture, telling a White House event: “Hopefully, we’re going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost, which is a horrible number, nevertheless.” Trump, who initially dismissed the outbreak as a “hoax”, has oscillated between claiming that a death toll of between 100,000 and 200,000 people would represent a success and predicting it could be as low as 60,000 or 70,000. According to the latest figures from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 62,406 people have died in the US since the outbreak began. US to allow emergency use of drug for hospitalised patients The drug remdesivir is approved for emergency use to treat virus patients. The FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn clarifies that the drug has specifically been cleared for emergency use on those in hospital. Trump says the approval represents a “very promising situation” and the White House’s taskforce coordinator Dr Deborah Birx adds: “I think this really illustrates what can happen in such a short time.” Markets slide on US-China Covid-19 trade war threat Trump’s threats to reignite the US-China trade war in reaction to the pandemic trigger a sell-off in global financial markets, as the economic costs of the pandemic continue to mount. Against a backdrop of rising tension between the world’s two biggest economic superpowers, share prices resume a downward slide, with the FTSE 100 falling by 144 points, or 2.5%, in London. Strict measures to continue in Ireland Restrictions on movement are to continue for several more weeks in Ireland, although over-70s may now leave their homes to exercise. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, says most restrictions will remain until 18 May to “weaken the virus further so it doesn’t make a comeback”. UK death toll rises to at least 27,510 The UK reports 739 more deaths, bringing the total death toll in the country to 27,510. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, says 177,454 people have tested positive: an increase of 6,201 since Thursday’s update. Of those, 15,111 patients are in hospital, Hancock says. India extends lockdown The country extends its lockdown – the world’s broadest by population – for two more weeks, but with some easing of restrictions in areas with few cases. The home ministry says that in view of “significant gains in the Covid-19 situation”, there will be “considerable relaxations” in areas with few or no cases. South Africa begins to ease lockdown Some industries are allowed to reopen after five weeks of restrictions in Africa’s most industrialised nation, which was already struggling with low growth and high debts when the lockdown began on 27 March. Its easing comes after the ratings agency S&amp;P downgraded the country’s credit rating to junk on Wednesday.
103	On 19 March, three things happened at once. Australia made the unprecedented announcement that its borders would close. Our plans to elope fell to pieces, like a virus touching soap. And our reasons for wanting to get married in the first place, much like international borders, hardened from something porous into solid concrete. We wanted the protection of marriage, fast. My partner and I were born 16,400km apart, in Newton, Massachusetts and Canberra, Australia respectively. This brings a frisson to our relationship – we spend hours swapping notes on the similarities and differences in our social milieus; we always have something to share that the other hasn’t seen; a reason to travel and a reason to come home. As the daughter of an unwed couple who’ve been together close to 40 years, I’d always been sceptical about marriage. But being with someone from another country has a way of making it seem more like an administrative necessity. It’s not quite a guarantee, but marriage is a magic piece of paper that makes it that much more likely you’ll get to spend the rest of your life with the person you love, regardless of where you’re going, where you’re from, or how quickly you have to get there. With the possibility of tragedy edging closer, we needed that magic. Between us we’ve lived in three countries and eight cities – there are people we love all over the world. Without an enormous expenditure of capital and carbon, we could never exchange vows without leaving somebody important out. If we eloped, at least everyone could feel equally angry at us. Meanwhile, the world seemed to flatten – when all your communication takes place on the phone or through a computer screen, it doesn’t matter who lives up the road and who lives a 24-hour flight away. Early in the evening of 22 March I made a proposal. Micah looked at me as though I was crazy. Then we hit the same wavelength, he called me a genius and pecked me on the lips. Covid-19 had already robbed the world of thousands of lives, jobs and freedoms – but could it give us our dream wedding? No complex travel arrangements, no savings drained. When most people’s realities have been completely upended, getting married on the internet just didn’t seem that weird any more. We could skip the most painful gut churn of wedding planning – weighing up our love for our friends against the cost of feeding them – and invite anyone who wanted to come. We just had to act fast. On 25 March we met our celebrant in a park – a “blue-eyed ninja” she called herself, in a black mask and blue rubber – gloves, and within five minutes, standing metres apart, we signed our notice of intended marriage. In Australia you have to fill in this paperwork at least 30 days before your ceremony. We gave ourselves 31 – hoping for the best, but preparing to cancel at any moment. As soon as the ink dried, it began. With government regulations setting a maximum of five people at weddings we were allowed two more people to join us in person as witnesses to this mad act of hope – I called my event planner friend, a set designer and “human Swiss army knife” Joshua, who would be tasked with turning our kitchen into something resembling an altar. Then we approached Charles, another close friend and videographer, who’d been contemplating setting up a livestreaming business. We wanted to be his first clients. Although I’d never imagined having one myself, I’ve always loved weddings. I love the dressing up and sense of occasion. But most of all, I love the chance to reconnect with old friends and make new ones. I love their sense of social possibility. I love the embarrassing stories. I wanted, more than anything, for our guests to have that feeling and I was confident I could find the perfect digital “venue”. Turns out, I was overconfident. Anyone who’s ever heard a feedback-induced portal to hell open on Zoom is probably aware that, although it is 2020, video conferencing technology never works how it should. Every night for the next week, I experimented with platforms. There was the one that crashed constantly and looked like science fiction from the 70s. There was the one that could ruin the entire ceremony if a single guest failed to hit mute. The one that cost hundreds of dollars and could only be purchased with an annual subscription – that we would be using a grand total of once. The best option was brand new. It launched around the same time Covid-19 was declared a pandemic. Designed for conferences and expos, the platform is called HopIn. It would allow for a “centre stage” for the ceremony. It would allow for different groups to sit at different “tables”, it would let guests send each other private messages; set up their own video chats and even bump into each other, in a function similar to that late-2000s forest of flashing – Chat Roulette. It looked perfect. So, as Australia’s curve began to flatten; and America’s began its terrifying ascent, our plans snowballed. Wedding planning became our answer to iso-baking. Micah learned how to dye my hair, and retouched my roots using a YouTube tutorial. Emily, a makeup artist, spent two hours teaching me how to paint a heavy face over Houseparty. Emma, a stylist, found me shoes and a pearl headdress online with lightning speed. Alex arranged a Zoom bucks and hens night, complete with an embarrassing PowerPoint presentation and a hangover that was anything but virtual. Nadine, who’d been on Micah and my first date, agreed to do a reading. A generous handful of friends, despite the pressures of being parents in confinement, managed to film gorgeous videos of their kids holding foliage so we could have flower children at our ceremony. Micah’s cousin in Chicago, a rabbi, agreed to give us a blessing. My closest friend, locked down in Paris and recovering from coronavirus, sewed a tuxedo for her dog’s favourite toy and turned her puppy into our ring bearer. But the biggest help came from our families. My 90-year-old grandmother, obeying stay-at-home orders in Sydney, agreed to wrap her head around a new piece of technology in order to give a speech live. “It’s like you’re making an episode of Married at First Sight,” she said on the phone, dryly one day, as I ran her through our to-do list. My mother found me the perfect wedding dress – the nightgown her late mother had worn on the night of her own wedding ceremony in 1952. Using measurements I’d emailed her, she hand-tailored it to fit me. Since our aisle would be the hallway from our bedroom to our kitchen, getting married in pyjamas felt entirely appropriate. Before the ceremony had even started, more than 40 people from all over the world had helped us make it happen. Lying in bed at night, Micah and I quietly wondered again and again whether we’d made the right decision. The thought of doing something so intimate and optimistic, in front of so many people, when the world was in such turmoil, made us both feel anxious. But then our inbox would ping from an invitee telling us how excited they were to be included, and our nerves would settle. On the day of our wedding, I was running late. My friend had arranged a “bridal prep” breakfast, complete with pink champagne and some of the people closest to me. My hands were trembling as I did my makeup. I glued my eyelids together trying to insert false lashes. I screamed and swore, and ran through our final rehearsal with blurry vision. I left my phone on the floor and showed my bridal party my underpants as I stepped over it in a panic. But seeing their faces on screen together – from Sydney, Canberra, New York, London and Paris, but all right there with me – brought on a wave of calm. We sent the last invitation to our wedding – via Instagram DM – just seven minutes before the ceremony started. And somehow, despite all the technical hurdles and physical barriers, miraculously removed by two tech support angels who offered to help even though they didn’t know us, it all worked out. To be a bride is to be on display, but it was still confronting to see myself as our guests saw me, in a tiny screen, weeping. As our celebrant mentioned the horror of the world around us in this moment, I locked eyes with Joshua. Coronavirus had taken someone close to him but still he was prepared to be there for us on this day; making lemonade out of bitter fruit. After the ceremony and speeches, we socialised with guests. I cheered when two of our friends – whose own vows had been delayed by the virus – stood up wearing full tuxedos on top with underpants and socks on the bottom. As we answered questions, our guests were talking to each other. My boss met my parents. People ran into exes, they offended each other with off-colour jokes. They saw old friends for the first time in years and made new connections. When the event concluded, we wandered the neighbourhood for photographs. On the street, the few cars that passed honked. A friend down the road walked by for a moment to catch my bouquet. Our inbox filled with pictures of our 400 or so guests; with messages of love, and gossip from the event. I crackled with nerves from the magnitude of it all, and clung close to my new husband. We ate cake, delivered by yet another friend, and kissed on the floor of our ersatz chapel. We revelled in our ability to be with each other that night, in a way that would not have been possible if our guests had been there too. At one point, I lay on the bathroom floor in silence, encoding the magnitude of what we’d entered into. I could never have handled being a bride in real life. But we’d managed to skip past all the parts of a wedding that made us most stressed, and keep the parts that mattered to us. If only we could have hugged our guests afterwards. On our first day as husband and wife, we lay in bed watching movies. We read the chatlog from our event and laughed at the highlights. No one asked us when we would have “a real wedding”. Beaming into the homes of everyone we love, from the home we built together, it felt about as real as it gets.
104	Channeling George Washington, Donald Trump, who has reportedly made 18,000 false or misleading claims in 1,170 days, recently proclaimed: “I cannot tell a lie.” The president’s ministry of untruth has produced some whoppers over the years. Kellyanne Conway gained immortality with “alternative facts”. Sean Spicer used his first briefing as White House press secretary to inflate the size of Trump’s inauguration crowd. His successor, Sarah Sanders, admitted to lying to reporters about the firing of the FBI director James Comey. The press secretary Stephanie Grisham never lied from the White House podium – because she never held a press briefing. So when the latest incumbent, Kayleigh McEnany, on Friday held the first such briefing in 417 days, the Associated Press reporter Jill Colvin had a question: “Will you pledge to never lie to us from that podium?” Without missing a beat, McEnany replied: “I will never lie to you. You have my word on that.” Expect to hear replays of that line before this presidency is done. Even on what proved an assured debut, McEnany skated close to peddling dodgy information about Trump’s responses to the coronavirus pandemic (“This president has always sided on the side of data”) and to allegations of sexual misconduct (“He has always told the truth”). But the good news for the White House is that McEnany, 32, benefits by comparison with the desperately low standards of both her boss and her predecessors. Over the past month Trump has been a verbal cannon of insults, mendacity, miracle cures, self-aggrandisement and self-pity, culminating in a proposal about bleach injection to fight Covid-19 that caused him to be metaphorically led away by men in white coats. Spicer, who turned up at his first briefing in an oversized jacket and a foul mood, often resembled a rabbit caught in headlights, sealing his fate by claiming Adolf Hitler never used chemical weapons. Sanders was an aggressive propagandist on her boss’s behalf. Grisham was missing in action. But McEnany, a devout Christian dressed in black and wearing a cross around her neck, who set down a binder of notes on a lectern that last year literally gathered dust, has plenty of TV experience and is a more polished performer than any of them. Set against Trump’s word salads, she sounded like a model of concision. Set against his temperament, she was the calm after the storm. She described Trump as “the most accessible president in history” and insisted his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who recently called the administration’s response to a pandemic which has killed 63,000 Americans a success story, “has done a great job”. She echoed Trump’s accusation that the World Health Organization “praised China’s leadership on the 22nd and 23rd” of January, without mentioning that on 22 January Trump tweeted “Terrific working with President Xi” and on 24 January wrote: “China has been working very hard to contain the coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well.” Thankfully for McEnany, reporters were too polite to point out her own remark on 25 February: “We will not see diseases like the coronavirus come here.” On the contrast between sexual assault allegations against Joe Biden and Brett Kavanaugh, she called the latter “a grave miscarriage of justice” so forcefully one might have assumed Kavanaugh had been destroyed, rather than now sitting on the supreme court. McEnany also went on the offensive over the FBI’s handling of the case against the former national security adviser Michael Flynn, suggesting it should “should scare every American” and parroting Trump’s refrain of “Russia, Russia, Russia”. When Jon Karl of ABC News asked about it, she tried to turn the tables: “Does it trouble you that the FBI said, ‘We’ve gotta get Flynn to lie?’ Doesn’t that trouble you as a journalist and, not only that, as an American citizen?” Karl replied dryly: “Well, it’s certainly something worth reporting. It’s not my job to say whether or not it’s troubling.” McEnany arched her left eyebrow at that. She also proved adept on the most important aspects of any press secretary’s job: the art of saying nothing. There were plenty of “I don’t want to get ahead of the president” deflections. As for policy depth, which is what the briefings are meant be about, that remains to be seen. Kurt Bardella, a political commentator, tweeted: “Objectively @kayleighmcenany is doing the best job (so far) at the podium for @realDonaldTrump than anyone else who has served as @PressSec ... her experience on cable news makes her a far more seasoned spokesperson than her predecessors.” From the Trump team’s point of view, Bardella added, “she is poised, capable, on-message, in-command, prepares and a very effective communicator”. Mark Meadows, the new White House chief of staff who has shaken up the communications operation, will probably be pleased. But it was McEnany’s sign-off that was perhaps the most revealing insight into what she called her “mission to bring you the mindset of the president”. She declared: “Of course, everyone should watch the Fox News town hall with the president from 7pm to 9pm [on Sunday]. It’ll be can’t-miss television – much like the highly rated President Trump coronavirus task force briefings have been.” If Trump’s attention span stretched to the end of the half-hour briefing, he will have been happy with that.
105	Donald Trump’s fourth White House press secretary delivered a 30-minute briefing on Friday, ending a more than year-long hiatus for the once-daily occasions. It was effectively a public debut for Kayleigh McEnany, whose immediate predecessor, Stephanie Grisham, never delivered a briefing in nine months in the role. Recently, Trump has turned daily coronavirus task force briefings into multi-hour back-and-forths with the press. Taking the lectern for the first time, McEnany stressed that she would be speaking on behalf of the president and the highest-ranking officials in his administration. “I’m around the president almost the entire day,” she said. “I was just with him before I left to come out and speak with you guys. “I think my staff can attest to the fact that they have a very hard time finding me because I’m normally with the president in the Oval Office. So I’m consistently with him, absorbing his thinking, and it’s my mission to bring you the mindset of the president, deliver those facts so this president gets fair and accurate reporting and the American people get fair and accurate information.” McEnany was less outwardly combative than Trump. She did not accuse White House reporters of being or peddling “fake news”. Nor did she say any outlet had terrible ratings. Still, she repeated Trump’s main arguments. Regarding the World Health Organization and its role in battling the coronavirus outbreak, for example, she said: “The WHO appears to clearly have a China bias. “I mean, you look at this timeline and it’s really damning for the WHO when you consider the fact that on 31 December you had Taiwanese officials warning about human-to-human transmission, the WHO did not make that public. “On 9 January, the WHO repeated China’s claim that the virus does not transmit readily between people, that was quite apparently false. On 14 January, the WHO again repeated China’s talking points about no human-to-human transmission.” Under fire for his own administration’s response to Covid-19, which as of Friday afternoon had infected more than 1 million Americans and killed more than 63,000, Trump has accused the WHO of slow-walking moves that could have prevented global spread. Earlier in April, he announced that his administration would halt funding to the organization, pending a review. McEnany’s first briefing also landed on the day that Trump’s all-but-certain general election opponent, the former vice-president Joe Biden, publicly responded to an allegation of sexual assault by a former Senate staffer. McEnany was asked about comments made by the president in an interview with a conservative radio host, that the allegation against Biden by Tara Reade was more credible than those made against the supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh by Christine Blasey Ford or against Trump by numerous women. McEnany framed the accusations as old news that had been cleared up by Trump’s victory in the 2016 election. “He has always told the truth on these issues,” she claimed. “He’s denied them immediately and you’re bringing up issues … from four years ago that were asked and answered and the American people had their say in the matter when they elected President Trump as president of the United States. “Leave it to the media to really take an issue about the former vice-president [Biden] and turn it on the president and bring up accusations from four years ago that were asked and answered in the form of the vote of the American people.” McEnany also discussed Michael Flynn, the first of Trump’s four national security advisers who resigned after a brief spell in the role and pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The president has indicated a potential pardon for Flynn, who has not yet been sentenced. On the subject of recently unsealed investigative documents, McEnany was asked why she called the FBI investigation of Flynn a “miscarriage of justice”, given his guilty plea. Reporters, she answered, should more aggressively cover how the FBI handled the investigation. Again, the press secretary – who earlier promised “never” to lie to reporters – sounded some of the same notes, in a the same tone, as Trump. “Do you not consider it a miscarriage of justice when you have the FBI writing ‘We want to get someone to lie?’” McEnany said. “The answer’s ‘yes’ and I encourage the media to cover it, because I’ve watched a lot of your networks I’ve read a lot of your papers. “I’ve seen a whole lot of scant information about Michael Flynn, when there was a whole lot of speculation about Russia, Russia, Russia, culminating in $40m of taxpayer money being lost, and the complete and total exoneration of President Trump.” Most observers do not consider the special counsel Robert Mueller to have exonerated Trump in his investigation of Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow. Indeed, though he did not establish a criminal conspiracy or recommend charges of obstruction of justice, Mueller said he was not clearing the president. Trump and his allies have regularly claimed exoneration regardless. It is unclear how often McEnany will appear in the White House briefing room. Trump press secretaries had their appearances scaled back after the president decided they were doing an inadequate job. “As to the timing of the briefings, we do plan to do them,” McEnany said. “I will announce the timing of that forthcoming but we do plan to continue these.” Her first appearance had lasted about half an hour, well short of Trump’s marathon sessions.
130	A Financial Times reporter accused by the Independent of listening in on sensitive Zoom meetings held by senior managers telling staff about salary cuts and furloughs has resigned. Mark Di Stefano, who joined the FT from Buzzfeed in January, tweeted on Friday that he had resigned and was “going to take some time away and log off”. Di Stefano had been accused of listening to the audio feed of video conference calls held by the Independent and its sister title the Evening Standard about responding to the financial impact of coronavirus. The FT suspended Di Stefano, who broke the news of the meetings on Twitter at the same time as staff were being informed, after the Independent discovered the eavesdropping from an analysis of Zoom log files and alerted the newspaper’s managers. “Last week, the FT received a complaint from the Independent that a reporter had joined a staff conference call without authorisation,” an FT spokeswoman said. “Access details had been shared with him. The journalist in question has now resigned from the company. “The FT wishes to apologise to the Independent and the Evening Standard, which subsequently informed the FT that the same reporter had accessed a meeting it had held.” Di Stefano’s actions raised questions about whether or not he had broken the law, given the meetings were not password protected. Christopher Hutchings, a lawyer at Hamlins who has dealt with a number of phone hacking cases, says “Zoombombing” could be in breach of the Computer Misuse Act and data protection and privacy laws. Di Stefano’s actions were in breach of the FT’s code of conduct, which states: “The press must not seek to obtain or publish material acquired by … intercepting private or mobile telephone calls, messages or emails. Engaging in misrepresentation or subterfuge … can generally be justified only in the public interest and then only when the material cannot be obtained by other means.” Hutchings said there was no a public interest defence to invoke in the case. “I would be extremely doubtful that the journalist’s conduct and actions would enable him to rely on this argument,” he said.
131	More countries across Europe are preparing to reopen schools in the coming weeks despite conflicting advice from scientists, some of whom caution against underestimating children’s potential to spread the coronavirus. Some schools and nurseries in Denmark and Norway have already reopened, and grandparents in Switzerland are allowed to hug grandchildren under 10, following a ruling by the health ministry’s head of infectious diseases that it is safe to do so. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has gone against the advice of the government’s scientific committee by announcing that creches and primary and nursery schools will reopen progressively from 11 May. Playgrounds began reopening in Germany on Friday and pupils aged 11 and 12 are due to return to school in a staggered system starting next week. Classes will be split in two and the groups will alternate between lessons at school and at home. Hygiene measures being adopted across Europe include strict handwashing and disinfection regimes, physical distancing and the demarcation of playgrounds into zones to ensure pupils do not mix more than necessary. Children will have to file out of classrooms at different times to maintain physical distancing. Germany has temporarily removed sport and music lessons from the curriculum because they are considered too great a risk, but older pupils already returned to sit exams last month. Nurseries will remain closed for all children, except those of key workers, for the time being. French lower secondary schools may only return in areas where the virus is not widely circulating. All ball games and contact sports will be banned and objects touched by more than one pupil must be disinfected. Classes will be staggered and made up of a maximum of 15 pupils, and breaks will held in shifts to avoid overcrowding in corridors and playgrounds. Many teachers say the draft health protocol detailing the regulations is unworkable, especially for classes of younger children. Céline Prier-Cheron, a trade union representative and teacher at a primary school in the Eure-et-Loir, told French TV: “How do you explain to children in nursery schools that they have to raise their hand to take an object, get up, go talk to a friend while respecting the barrier and distancing rules? “This health protocol cannot be applied as it is, especially in nursery schools. Teaching is based on the handling of objects, especially in nursery. If we have to disinfect objects each time a child has handled them, it’ll be impossible.” The parents’ federation, the FCPE, tweeted that parents were reluctant to send children back to school. “That is what our members are telling us, but they are obviously also under constraints from their employers,” it wrote. “But there are still too many uncertainties.” The president of Germany’s main teachers’ union, Heinz-Peter Meidinger, said he supported the plan to teach children in alternating shifts, but that regulating hygiene measures was a “mammoth task”. Despite the phased reopenings, scientists in Germany have said children with the coronavirus may be as infectious as adults, and urged caution. Researchers who analysed data on infected people found that the viral loads in children differed little from those in adults. Opening schools on the assumption that children are less likely to spread the virus was therefore ill-advised, said Christian Drosten, a virologist and Germany’s leading coronavirus expert, who led the team. Drosten’s study, which was released this week, examined the viral loads in the throats of 3,721 people, including more than 100 children, who tested positive for coronavirus in Berlin between January and April. He said he had been able to carry out his analysis once the number of tests carried out by Labor Berlin, the largest laboratory of its kind in Europe, had reached the critical mass of 60,000 earlier this week. That gave him and his team enough data to be able to carry out an analysis of children who have had the virus. Data on children has been scant because of the lack of tests that have been carried out on them, often because they show few if any symptoms. “The end result is as clear as glass,” Drosten said on his podcast with the broadcaster NDR. “Children do not have significantly different concentrations of the virus in their respiratory passages compared to adults.” Drosten said children were as likely to spread the virus as adults, particularly given their social behaviour, including an inability to practice physical distancing, their increased mobility and a tendency to sing and cry – activities proven to give the virus droplets as much force as a cough or a sneeze. Lothar Wieler, the head of Germany’s leading disease control body, the Robert Koch Institute, said on Thursday that children play just as important a role in spreading the disease as adults. “They can be infected, they can excrete the virus and they can infect others,” he said.
132	My great friend Peter Walsh, who has died suddenly aged 66 from undetected heart disease, was a criminal defence barrister committed to protecting civil and legal rights and a dedicated football mentor who founded, funded and coached youth teams. Peter was born in Clydebank, Glasgow, one of three children of Tommy Walsh, a docker, and his wife, Sadie (nee Dolan). Home life in Glasgow was unhappy and when Peter was eight, his mother took the children away to Hull, where she qualified as a teacher. There Peter grew up in a socialist community and his mother succeeded in becoming a primary headteacher. His stepfather, Walt Cunningham, was a dockers’ shop steward and later city councillor. After attending the local Buckingham Street primary school, in 1964 Peter went to the new David Lister high school, Hull’s first comprehensive. There, he thrived, representing the school at football, cricket, rugby, badminton, volleyball, hockey and cross-country running. But his time at David Lister came to a premature end when he was expelled aged 17 for persistent lateness and alleged insolence. He felt unjustly treated and it was a formative experience. With the help of a maths teacher, Harry Gurevitch, with whom Peter formed a lasting bond, he took his A-levels at another Hull comprehensive, the Leo Schultz high school. Peter then went to City of London Polytechnic (now London Metropolitan University) and took a degree in politics and government, maintaining his sporting activities. He captained the football team to national success, winning the British Polytechnics Cup in 1976, and the following year became president of the student union. He then studied law – also at City Polytechnic – and was called to the bar in 1982 at Gray’s Inn. After his pupillage in Middlesbrough, he practised in Newcastle, at 46 Grainger Street and finally Trinity Chambers, where his commitment to justice blossomed and he became well known for supporting junior staff. He was a successful criminal defence barrister, driven by the principle that a person charged with a crime is entitled to representation by an independent advocate whose skills as a lawyer should be of the highest order. Peter started youth football teams wherever he lived and funded them himself: Clara Vale Celtic, Wylam Celtic and in 2003 he revived football in Corbridge, where he lived, welcoming players of all abilities and giving life to the now thriving Tynedale Football club. He played cricket for Stocksfield and Corbridge, was a qualified football coach and referee and was still playing football and cricket right up to his death. Peter remained a staunch Celtic fan. He also had a lifelong love of Hull Kingston Rovers, passed on by his stepdad, and visited from Corbridge as often as possible to watch them. Peter loved being outdoors, walking Murphy, his beloved dog, growing his own vegetables on his allotment and cooking for his family. He walked Hadrian’s wall and climbed the “three peaks”, and had been planning to do the coast-to-coast walk this year. Peter is survived by his wife, Debbie (nee Lynch), whom he married in 1986, their children, Adam, Rose Erin, Caitlin and Patrick, and his siblings, Rosemary and Thomas.
133	The president of one of Britain’s biggest unions has vowed to protect the safety of its female workers, after an independent investigation was launched into the personal conduct of its former general secretary. Barbara Plant, president of the GMB union, said the safety of “our people, particularly women” was paramount to her, following allegations made against Tim Roache. Roache, 57, unexpectedly stepped down from the top role in Britain’s third-largest trade union on Tuesday, after being re-elected just five months ago. Initially the GMB, which represents 600,000 workers including ambulance drivers and manufacturing staff, said Roache had taken the “difficult decision” to resign because of ill health. A day later it updated its statement, giving more details about Roache’s health and confirming that an inquiry into claims made against him was under way. It confirmed it had received an anonymous letter a week earlier. Plant and the GMB’s acting general secretary, John Phillips, wrote to all its staff on Friday afternoon thanking them for their resilience and saying it had “been an incredibly difficult few days for everyone”. The letter said “a full, transparent and independent investigation into the number of very serious allegations made by way of an anonymous letter” had been agreed. It added: “In the meantime, the safety and security of all staff is of paramount importance. We are acting with urgency to create a safe space for staff to anonymously raise … [any issues].” They encouraged people to come forward to report any concerns, and promised their full support. On Thursday Plant had tweeted: “The safety of our people, particularly women, and the integrity of our union is paramount to me as GMB national president. I support a fully independent investigation into the serious allegations raised around the departure of our previous GS [general secretary]. “I support a safe space for our people to come forward with any concerns. We stand for dignity or we stand for nothing.” The Guardian has seen an anonymous letter, which purports to be from “concerned GMB staff”, which urged the union “to suspend Tim Roache with immediate effect, pending a full investigation”. On Wednesday, following questions regarding Roache’s conduct, the GMB issued a statement, which said: “GMB received an anonymous letter, last Wednesday, in which a number of allegations have been made about Tim’s conduct whilst he held the office of general secretary.” The statement said Roache – who led the union from 2015 – had been diagnosed some years ago with ME, or chronic fatigue syndrome, and had been advised to refrain from work. Roache, who was often seen as a critic of Jeremy Corbyn, has been a key figure within the union movement. The GMB – which backed Lisa Nandy in the Labour leadership contest – has donated more than £12m to the party over the past five years, according to Electoral Commission records. Earlier on Wednesday, a spokesman for Keir Starmer declined an offer to back Roache following his resignation. Roache has been approached for comment.
134	Donald Trump’s threats to reignite the US-China trade war over coronavirus has triggered another sell-off in global financial markets, as the economic costs of the pandemic continue to mount. Against a backdrop of rising tension between the world’s two economic superpowers, share prices resumed a downward slide on Friday with the FTSE 100 falling by 144 points, or 2.5%, in London. Selling pressure resumed on Wall Street after recording gradual gains in recent weeks amid rising hopes a turning point had been reached for the coronavirus crisis. As fears over the economic costs from the disease mount and as the White House ramped up the threat of a renewed trade conflict with Beijing, the Dow Jones industrial average fell by more than 2% in afternoon trading in New York. Stock prices fell sharply in Japan, with the Nikkei index of leading Japanese company shares sliding by more than 500 points, or 2.8%. Markets in China, Hong Kong and South Korea were closed for public holidays. Despite world leaders starting to outline plans to lift lockdown measures more than a month on from the depths of the crisis, the economic fallout from tight controls on social and business activity during the Covid-19 outbreak are now becoming increasingly clear. Faced with a deep recession in an election year, Trump escalated his attack on Beijing by claiming he had seen evidence showing the virus originated in a Chinese laboratory. The US president is increasingly making China’s handling of the pandemic a major issue as his ratings sag ahead of his November re-election campaign. Reports suggested the White House is crafting renewed import tariffs that would be applied to Chinese imports in retaliation, in a major escalation of the trade standoff. The US and China had signed the first phase of a trade deal earlier this year to de-escalate trade tensions between Washington and Beijing that had damaged global growth last year and sapped business investment around the world. However, progress has been derailed at the onset of a blame game over Covid-19 as the number of infections around the world climbs, with the US recording the highest official death toll of any country so far. Analysts warned a renewed US-China trade conflict, as the world heads for the worst recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s, could inflict additional damage for jobs and growth. Brad Bechtel, of the US bank Jefferies, said: “It seems that as we start to unwind lockdown measures and head back into election season the Trump administration will amp up the blame-game rhetoric, further alienating China.” Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at the financial trading platform IG, said a trade war was the “last thing markets want right now”. As the economic costs from the coronavirus mount, unemployment in the US has surged by more than 30 million in the past six weeks. US growth figures this week showed that the American economy contracted by 4.8% in the first three months of the year, the sharpest decline since 2008. Major companies issued a barrage of negative updates on Friday as businesses around the world count the financial costs of lockdown. Against a backdrop of plunging oil prices as demand for crude evaporates with economic activity in developed countries close to a standstill, the US oil company ExxonMobil reported a loss after $3bn was wiped off the value of its oil reserves. In the UK, Royal Bank of Scotland took an £800m profit hit because of the pandemic’s economic effects, while Ryanair said it was planning to cut 3,000 jobs and reduce staff pay by up to a fifth in response to the crisis. Chris Iggo, of the investment management firm Axa, said recovery momentum in financial markets over recent weeks was fading amid the growing realisation that exiting lockdown measures would be difficult. “There is lots to ponder about how we emerge from lockdown … Social distancing and a high level of focus on health will remain features of our lives for some time to come.”
106	The owners of Virgin Media and O2 are in talks to create a new TV and mobile power player to challenge BT and Sky in the UK. Billionaire John Malone’s Liberty Global, which owns Virgin Media and a 10% stake in ITV, is understood to be in talks with Spanish telecoms giant Telefonica to combine their UK assets in a joint venture. The talks will raise speculation about whether Liberty may be open to including ITV in the deal, as the share price of the broadcaster of shows including Coronation Street and Love Island has hit a 10-year low amid the fall in ad revenues due to the coronavirus. In 2006, Virgin Media’s then owner Sir Richard Branson saw the benefits of a takeover of ITV, but Sky took a stake in the free-to-air broadcaster to thwart the move. Malone’s Liberty Global is ITV’s largest shareholder, making him the kingmaker in any potential deal for the broadcaster. A deal between Virgin Media and O2 would bring together the mobile operator’s 34m customers, the largest network in the UK, with the cable operator’s 5.3m broadband, pay-TV and mobile users. O2 has been a target for a potential takeover since 2015 when a £10.25bn bid by rival Three UK, which is owned by Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, was blocked by the European Commission on competition grounds. Telefonica subsequently explored a potential £10bn spin-off of the business on the London stock market to reduce debt. The initial public offering was subsequently put on hold as the impact of Brexit raised fears over the state of the UK economy. A combination of Virgin Media, which runs virtual mobile network Virgin Mobile using BT’s network, and O2 has previously been seen in the city as a smart consolidation move in the UK telecommunications industry. In November, Telefonica, which is due to announce first-quarter earnings on 7 May, announced a major global restructuring plan to focus on four main markets including the UK, while selling off a number of assets in Latin America. Last year, Liberty Global sold its German and Eastern European cable assets to Vodafone for €18bn. As a result the company has about £5.6bn in cash to deploy for potential investments. Liberty Global and Vodafone have previously held talks about a tie-up in the UK, similar to the current talks between Virgin Media and O2, but they did not progress to a deal. However, the two companies struck a joint venture deal in the Netherlands in 2016, combining cable and mobile networks, and a revival of talks in the UK cannot be ruled out now a potential deal with O2 has been made public. Last year, Vodafone and Virgin Media signed a deal in the UK to use each other’s networks, which was viewed as a renewing of closer ties that could kick on to potential talks of a wider deal. Liberty Global, Virgin Media, O2 and Telefonica declined to comment.
107	In the pagan calendar, 1 May is Beltane, midway between the spring equinox and the longest day. It marks the point when weather is supposed to improve, and is also called Cétshamhain, or first of summer. Beltane was a traditional Celtic festival celebrated in Scotland, Ireland and Wales, with similar events in Germany and Sweden. The name Beltane probably means “blazing fire”, and the night was marked by the lighting of bonfires to symbolically invoke the growing power of the sun. Dancers would caper around or jump over fires, and cattle were driven around or between fires before being herded to their summer pastures. All the hearths in the community would be extinguished and relit with brands from the Beltane fire. The flames were supposed to have a cleansing effect, the renewed solar light driving out the accumulated bad spirits and pestilence of the long winter. Beltane traditions continued well into the 19th century, despite opposition from the church which attempted to rebrand the event as Walpurgis Night, or Saint Walpurga’s Eve, after the saint responsible for protection against plagues. Beltane has been revived in the modern era as a cultural festival. The celebrations may be low-key this year, but the disinfecting power of the returning sun has rarely been more welcome.
108	The Milan and Paris catwalks may be closed but on Friday 40 of the world’s top models recreated the runway experience in their kitchens and living rooms for an event billed as the world’s “first self-filmed fashion show”. Karen Elson walked down a red rug in her hallway; Lara Stone modelled a tomato red jumpsuit in front of a sofa. Eva Herzigová stalked down a corridor wearing a black lace gown and top hat. Halima Aden filmed herself “catwalking” on her balcony. Joan Smalls posed in her sun-drenched back yard in Puerto Rico. Karlie Kloss, Ashley Graham and Alessandra Ambrósio also took part. The 30-minute ‘Fashion Unites’ event was organised by CR Runway, the organisation run by the former French Vogue editor-in-chief Carine Roitfeld, and Aids charity Amfar, to raise money for its newly launched Covid-19 fund. Despite its lo-fi feel – and with the inevitable lockdown cameos from dogs and babies, and glimpses of bookshelves and soft furnishings – the event took a month, and a team of 60, to organise, Roitfeld said. “Casting was a long process,” she said, with models’ bookers working from home in several different countries. And with everyone in lockdown, videos were required to help the models prep. The make-up artist Tom Pecheux created a video explaining “that the make-up was to be more of a smoky black eye,” said Roitfeld. Another by the hairdresser Sam McKnight talked them through the required “do”. “Nail direction” came from Mei Kawajiri, who instructed them to “do a nice transparent colour and write ‘Carine’ in eyeliner on one of your nails”. The choreographer Stephen Galloway instructed them remotely on their walks. The music was important. “We sent them music beforehand to give good energy to walk – the energy is amazing,” said Roitfeld. The results, she added, “were quite beautiful. These models know how to do their make-up and hair better than you or I.” Models wore clothes from their own wardrobes. “I couldn’t send anything to them,” Roitfeld explained. “Which was a challenge for me, ‘a control freak’. But we just said: ‘Wear something that makes you feel good. If you want to be evening, be evening, or you can be in your joggings.’” The fashion industry has been upended by the Covid-19 crisis, with the crew of photo shoots and catwalk shoots particularly impacted, often unable to work remotely. Fashion shows, with their huge backstage teams and audiences of hundreds sitting shoulder to shoulder, look unlikely to return for many months. The event was conceived to replace a real-life CR Runway fashion show. “Unfortunately so many cannot work, and it’s going to be a big problem,” Roitfeld said. “But the show must go on and even if it’s tough we have to do something. “Everyone is going to have to become creative. We are going to have better times but it will never be like before. It will be a totally different world, not just for fashion but in general.” Other big names appeared during the show to give what Roitfeld described as “messages of love and support”. Kim Kardashian West was among those popping up, as well as designers including Off-White’s Virgil Abloh, Diane von Fürstenberg and Alexander Wang. Not only is the fashion industry struggling logistically and economically, but it is also recalibrating tonally as recession looms. This event, said Roitfeld, “might make fashion more approachable, because not all of the girls are living in some huge villa in Beverley Hills, some of them don’t have big apartments. It makes them more approachable. It’s more human in a way.”
109	Listeners could be forgiven for a sense of deja vu: “It’s going to go. It’s going to leave. It’s going to be gone,” Donald Trump pronounced of coronavirus on Wednesday. The words were eerily similar to the president’s prediction in late February that “It’s going to disappear” – a theme he harped on repeatedly as the caseload and fatalities rose. Since that forecast, a million Americans have fallen ill with coronavirus – almost a third of the global total – and more than 60,000 have died, in just a few weeks surpassing the US death toll in all the years of the Vietnam war. This week, it was reported that almost 70 people had died at a single veterans’ nursing home in Massachusetts. New York is struggling to bury its dead. This is what the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, describes as “a great success story”. This is the context in which the administration is letting its physical distancing guidelines lapse, instead advising much less stringent measures. Mr Kushner suggests that by July the country could be “really rocking again”. But Americans will suffer from Mr Trump’s keenness to get back to business, as if the pre-coronavirus state of affairs were still possible. Medical experts have already warned about the risks of another surge in cases. The question is whether states, cities, institutions and individuals can again mitigate the harm he is wreaking upon his country. Some may; others are leading his charge: in Georgia, such essential services as tattoo parlours and bowling alleys are once again plying their trade. Texas is allowing shops, cinemas, shopping malls and restaurants to reopen, albeit with restrictions on capacity. Without significant testing and tracing, it is evident where such decisions will lead. The best that can be said for Mr Trump’s election-driven wishful thinking is that it is less immediately dangerous than his recent public musings that people might have injections of disinfectant as a cure. Each week of the pandemic has brought new shame upon the president: he failed to equip his country and its health workers, to advocate physical distancing when it was desperately needed, or even to look like he was seriously concerned about the outbreak and its victims, preferring instead to boast about the ratings for his briefings. While leaders around the world enjoyed a surge in support as the pandemic took hold – the rally-around-the-flag effect – Mr Trump’s appalling performance has finally taken a toll on his popularity. He had counted on a strong economy to see him back into office in November. But with more than 30 million US workers filing unemployment claims in the last six weeks – and economists suggesting that the real level of job losses could be far worse – his confidence has been shaken. This week it was reported that he had lashed out at his own campaign after polls showed him trailing Joe Biden in crucial states and with older voters. With the Democrat facing a sexual assault claim and running a virtual campaign while Mr Trump commands daily airtime, it is clear that the president is doing the damage himself. He is seeking to shift the blame for the pandemic to the World Health Organization (having ignored its repeated warnings) and to China. On Thursday he contradicted his own director of national intelligence by claiming that he had seen evidence that the virus originated in a Wuhan laboratory; Trump officials have reportedly leaned on the agencies to find evidence to back the theory. This conduct too is unpleasantly familiar. His contempt for the truth; his determination to evade responsibility while holding the most powerful job in the world; his ignorance, his narcissism and the threat he poses to his country – all have become still more painfully evident through this crisis, but were clear before. Yet he has so far defied the laws of political gravity. Americans have paid dearly for Mr Trump’s complacency, recklessness, irrationality and incompetence. But are they at last ready to make him pay?
110	The makers of the new 12-part adaptation of Sally Rooney’s 2018 novel Normal People have pulled off a remarkable feat. Avoiding all that is perfunctory about too many stage and screen versions of literary hits, they have crafted a work, available on iPlayer, that is set to become a television drama classic. Writing, casting, acting, direction: all are pin sharp. The risks of filming such sexually explicit material are triumphantly grasped. The novel and its author (who co-wrote the script) are Irish. In a British media landscape increasingly dominated by the US – with organisations from local papers to the BBC under threat while Netflix, Disney and Amazon reap the lockdown’s rewards – Normal People’s locations in Sligo, Dublin, Italy and Sweden are not the least of its pleasures. But the more extraordinary journey, particularly to viewers whose teenage years are long past, is through the actors to the unforgettable intensity of first love and lust. The intimate bond between Marianne (Daisy Edgar-Jones) and Connell (Paul Mescal) is the story’s subject and the depiction of their struggles to define themselves and each other, against familial and social backdrops that are shown to have penetrated their characters at the deepest levels, is sexy, romantic – and not soppy at all. It’s widely if not universally acknowledged that young people are having a tough time. In the UK, the combination of tuition fees, the gig economy and housing costs meant many were struggling even before the coronavirus hit. But while Rooney’s characters are insulated from these pressures (Marianne by wealth, Connell by intelligence), her sympathetic portrayal of the dilemmas of youth feels particularly apt in our divided times. Like the main character in Rooney’s first book, Connell is a writer. He and Marianne vie to praise each other’s brains. But (as with Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag) they show that cleverness can be a partner to confusion. Both on paper and screen, Rooney makes a case for fiction as a route to deeper understanding. The male gaze remains the default setting for visual culture, with women’s bodies routinely objectified decades after feminists began protesting about this. Normal People can now be added to a too-short list of film and TV dramas that have a woman’s sexuality, complete with a troubling masochistic streak in Marianne’s case, at the fore. But it is far from a didactic piece. Like Noah Baumbach’s 2019 film Marriage Story, it is committed to seeing the heterosexual relationship it describes from both male and female points of view. With episodes that are mostly less than 30 minutes, the series can either be rationed or binged on in a single six-hour stretch. It is not only superlative television, but a reminder of the symbiotic connections between the different arts. Without Sally Rooney’s novel, there would be no series. Has there ever been a time when we were in greater need of such works and the insights they offer?
111	Joe Biden has categorically denied allegations from a former Senate aide that he sexually assaulted her in 1993. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee’s first public comment on the allegation came at a delicate moment for his campaign. “I recognize my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate, and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished,” Biden wrote in a Medium post on Friday morning. “So I want to address allegations by a former staffer that I engaged in misconduct 27 years ago. They aren’t true. This never happened.” Biden said he would ask the National Archives to make public any record of a complaint his accuser, Tara Reade, says she filed at the time. Biden said any such document would not be kept at the University of Delaware, among his Senate papers. “I’m saying unequivocally, it never, never happened,” he told MSNBC’s Morning Joe. Reade came forward last month to accuse Biden of sexually assaulting her at a Capitol Hill office complex in spring 1993. His campaign had said the account is false, but Biden had not addressed it. Asked if he remembered Reade, Biden said he did not remember “any type of complaint she may have made”. Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski repeatedly asked if he would authorize a search of his Senate papers. He declined, insisting they “do not contain personnel files”. “They’re not there,” he said. In a statement, however, the National Archives said “any records of Senate personnel complaints from 1993 would have remained under the control of the Senate”. Asked if he was confident no such complaint existed, Biden offered a qualified response: “I know of no one who was aware any complaint was made.” He also said there were no non-disclosure agreements that would prevent women from speaking out. In a statement, Rainn, an anti-sexual violence organization, called for the release of “any and all records that may be relevant, including those housed at the University of Delaware”. “We urge him, his campaign and former staff to cooperate fully and provide complete transparency,” said Heather Drevna, a spokeswoman. The race between Biden and Donald Trump, who himself faces – and denies – accusations of sexual assault and misconduct from more than a dozen women, will be the first of the #MeToo era. Republicans have begun to weaponize Reade’s story while Democrats stand behind Biden. Brzezinski pressed Biden on his support for Dr Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault during his supreme court confirmation hearings. Then, Biden said “it takes enormous courage for a woman to come forward under bright lights, with millions of people watching, and relive something that happened to her”. Ford, he said, “should be given the benefit of the doubt and not be, you know, abused again by the system”. Biden said his position was consistent. Women who come forward deserve “to start off with the presumption that they are telling the truth”, he said. “Then you have to look at the circumstances and the facts and the facts in this case do not exist. They never happened.” Democrats are aware of the importance of female voters. Women are among Trump’s fiercest critics and have organized, voted and run for office in record numbers since his election. Biden has vowed to pick a woman as his running mate. On Friday, Biden pointed to his record as the author of the Violence Against Women Act, and his work as vice-president on combatting sexual assault on college campuses. Yet he has faced renewed scrutiny over his handling of Anita Hill’s testimony during the supreme court nomination of Clarence Thomas, who she accused of sexual harassment, in the 1990s. Before Biden launched his campaign, eight women accused him of touching them or displaying affection in ways that made them uncomfortable. Reade was among them. She did not make her accusation of sexual assault until this year, when she told podcast host Katie Halper Biden allegedly pinned her against a wall and penetrated her with his fingers. Those alleged events were presented to Biden on Morning Joe. He denied them. “I’m not going to go in and question her motive,” Biden said. “I’m not going to attack her. She has a right to say whatever she wants to say but I have a right to say, ‘Look at the facts, check it out.’” In his statement, Biden said women “should be heard, not silenced” but said scrutiny of the “full and growing record of inconsistencies in [Reade’s] story, which has changed repeatedly in both small and big ways” warranted further examination. Tina Tchen, president of advocacy group Time’s Up Now, said: “Today, Vice-President Joe Biden sat down and directly addressed the allegation against him with the seriousness it deserves, something that the current president has never done.” In an interview with conservative radio host Dan Bongino, Trump offered Biden advice: “I would just say to Joe Biden, ‘Just go out and fight it.’ “All of a sudden you become a wealthy guy, you’re a famous guy, then you become president, and people just – people that you’ve never seen, that you’ve never heard of, make charges,” Trump said, before turning back to Biden: “So I guess in a way you could say I’m sticking up for him.” During a White House briefing, the press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, asserted that the American people have already rendered a verdict on the accusations against Trump, by electing him. But last year the advice columnist E Jean Carroll alleged Trump raped her in the mid-1990s, which the president denied. A defamation lawsuit from another accuser is currently on hold in New York. Biden sought to draw a sharp contrast. “We have lived long enough with a president who doesn’t think he is accountable to anyone, and takes responsibility for nothing,” he said. “That’s not me. I believe being accountable means having the difficult conversations, even when they are uncomfortable. People need to hear the truth.”
112	At the beginning of the week, I chatted to Lea, my darling mother-in-law in Wellington, New Zealand. A first-time online grocery buyer, she had ordered three carrots – but then 3kg of them arrived at her door. We were throwing up ideas about what to do with them. Our solutions: quick vinegar brine pickle, carrot kraut, roasted carrots confit, carrot juice – it’s safe to say she’ll be good for beta-carotene for a while. Lea is not alone. Once you have stepped off the baking train – because really how many more cakes, loaves of sourdough and crumpets can you eat before your blood sugar levels decide to stay permanently spiked – you might find yourself ordering mystery produce boxes for the fun of it. Full disclosure: I am also a purveyor of one such mystery box. Our Boon Luck Farm in Byron has been growing organic heirloom produce for some of Australia’s well known restaurants. Those restaurants have temporarily closed, so they’re no longer ordering what we specifically grow for them. I’m in the same boat as every primary producer whose main business is restaurants. Now the world over, home cooks have direct access to previously hard to procure lobsters, prime cuts of reserved Wagyu, or tiger striped jungle peanuts. Things that are usually snapped up by chefs for their tasting menus. Never before has it been more fun to cook at home. The creative uses for some of the produce that I am seeing is refreshing, but some produce can be harder to use or use up, and leaves people completely stumped. Lots of online stores will allow you select the contents – but I urge you to support your local small-scale farmers and buy a grab-bag direct from them, as you will get the freshest seasonal produce with the proceeds going straight to the source. Besides, it’s more fun that way. When your box arrives … First, lay everything on your kitchen table or bench. Group the produce like for like: brassicas, lettuces, fruits, herbs, roots etc. Then do as chefs do: wrap them up appropriately for storage, don’t wash anything unless you are ready to use it (as it will likely bruise or accelerate the decomposition of the vegetable), and do not pre-cut anything you won’t use that day, as the more surface area something has, the faster it dries out. Wrap your herbs in a moist paper towel, and put anything with leaves into your crisper. Apples, grapes, squashes, cucumbers, leeks, fennel and anything you want crisp goes into the fridge. Pears and avocados depend on the stage of ripeness – if they’re soft, put them into the fridge, otherwise leave them on the bench to ripen more. Citrus, bananas, pumpkins, onions, garlic and potatoes are best left out. If you want to speed up the ripening of bananas and avocados, pop them together in a paper bag – the natural ethanol released will work very well. Pull out pencil and paper and get planning your week’s menu and larder staples. You may just find this becomes a highlight of your week, and perhaps the habit will even stick around when the restaurants start opening up again. What to do when you have a whole lot of one thing? Fermenting: If you received a whole cabbage, unless you are a large family you won’t finish it off in a week – so portion out what you can eat. With the rest, wash it, weigh it up, add 3% of the total weight in salt and get massaging. Let it sit for an hour and then drain excess liquid, put it in a sterilised glass jar and let it ferment on the kitchen bench until sour. Then refrigerate it – et voilà sauerkraut. Date it so you know when it was made. The things that can be lacto fermented include but are not limited to: all manner of brassicas (bok choy, cabbage, rapini), carrots, parsnips, swedes, fennel bulbs, beetroot, celery, and even fruit like melon rinds and apples. Get inspired to include aromats like dried or fresh herbs, garlic, chillies, ginger, galangal, makrut lime leaves and even citrus peel. Freezing: With pumpkins and sweet potatoes, once the season starts it seems to never end. There’s a reason that grocers sell things by halves, like celery, watermelons and pumpkins. If you are going to cook with a pumpkin or sweet potato, don’t just cut the wedge you plan on eating tonight. Cook and process the whole lot. By processing I mean steaming or roasting. Then portion it out into 250g servings and freeze it. Having these on hand means you can defrost to instantly make a soup, curry, warm salad, frittata or even make custard to fill a pie. Don’t be afraid to freeze things; most defrost well enough, and need only a little warming in the oven before you can use them. Once it’s been reheated, use it straight away as refreezing isn’t a good idea. Things that can steamed or roasted, then frozen, include peppers, beetroot, carrots, potatoes, swedes, parsnips, onions (best roasted) and most root vegetables. I almost always roast veg with olive oil, grey salt and whole bulbs of garlic de-cloved. The rule is always low and slow. When you come to portion everything out, separate the excess oil and garlic cloves and put them into a jar. This will create a flavoured oil to use in salad dressing, or even for finishing off meats, soups and casseroles. Mashing the roasted garlic on toast is a particular delight. I have mysterious leafy greens … Some greens need long slow cooking times, some need just a quick blanch or stir fry and some are just best left alone to eat raw in a salad. Slow braising Woodier greens like cavolo nero, silver beet, radish tops, the tops of any root veg, chicory, cardoons and artichokes (I know they’re not leafy greens but still need to be mentioned) benefit from longer braising. This requires homemade stock or water and olive oil in a 3:1 ratio, plus salt and garlic. At the end of the long simmer, finish off with something acidic like vinegar or citrus. The time depends on the toughness of the leaves, but I find that anything needing a braise longer than 20-30 minutes isn’t worth eating. This is a deliciously universal way of cooking vegetables that are a little woodier and benefit from being eaten on the softer side – do not be concerned if the greens turn olive or even brown. Brown food is delicious. Keep adjusting the liquid as you go, not allowing the greens to be swamped, and likewise not drying them out. I really like to finish off a longer braise like this with a contrast of something fresh in at the end, like freshly shelled or frozen peas and a generous fistful of chopped fresh herbs – like flat-leafed parsley. I love eating these greens as a side to some protein, or even a main meal with a fried egg. It also keeps very well refrigerated to snack on later, or to put on toast that you’ve rubbed with the garlic confit I mentioned earlier. Quick cooking These techniques are for softer greens that are just too horrid to eat raw – water spinach, in fact all spinach, Asian brassicas like Chinese broccoli, choy sum, and even lettuces. By cooking them you will actually unlock more of their nutrients, especially if you add a citric element to it at the end. Either a quick stir fry with some rendered pork fat or a healthy oil like olive or macadamia and chopped garlic and a simple seasoning, or blanching and steaming, work well. For stir frying, let your wok or pan heat up first, add your fat and wait a minute, or use this time to chop up your garlic. If steaming or blanching, leave the water on high until it is full-on boiling then add the vegetables to cook – very minimally. Even once you’ve turned off the heat, the vegetables will still be cooking, so bear that in mind. I tend to turn the heat off just before I think the vegetables are at point I like to eat them, because the transition time from cooking to plating will make those veggies exactly right. Greens to keep raw Lettuces, salad mixes, radicchio, endive, softer hearts of certain chicories, celery hearts and leaves, sorrel, edible weeds like pennywort, purslane and cranberry hibiscus are all best left cold. Don’t forget that even in the raw state, when you add oils, acid and salt, you are essentially cooking it minimally. I could eat salads till the cows come home, and there are a million ways to make it. All you need for inspiration is to taste what is in season and remember the tenets of flavour profiles – salty, sour, sweet, bitter and fat – when you are composing a salad. Add a little of each, tasting as you go. Don’t forget that you can always add larder staples like nuts, fresh or dried fruits, cooked grains or cheeses. Layer your sour notes by using different vinegars, citrus juice and zest. Don’t forget there are many ways to salt your food that don’t even include salt, like fish sauce, anchovies, shrimp paste, Vegemite, seaweed and other sea vegetables, miso, soy sauce or even nutritional yeast. Pull out your frozen roasted vegetables and add those too. And the rest of it … Use up odds and ends such as off-cuts and peels of carrots, daikon, parsnip, onions, garlic peel, celery and mushrooms in bone stocks (my tip is to roast the bones first for a deeper flavour). These can be portioned out and kept frozen (250mls is my preferred size). If I don’t have quite enough to make a large pot, I save everything up in the freezer first until I do. Making stock can feel like a commitment – it is – but once you’ve finished washing that big pot and your freezer is well stocked up with the future potential of soups, curries, ragu and the like, you will feel an immense satiety. Water kefir is another great way to use up bits and bobs from fruit. Feeding the grains and drinking the byproduct is a source of continual entertainment and probiotics. Water kefir grains can be bought online; I like the Fermentary. Figuring out what to feed my water kefir grains, and the trial and error of flavour combinations, is a source of real joy for me at the moment – lemongrass is a winner, for instance. Cooking from a mystery box is an adventure – the best thing to do is to take a deep breath and dive right in.
113	We’ve published a bunch of articles about how the coronavirus crisis has impacted the Australian arts industry. But there are small things you can do. It’s an imperfect solution, as highlighted last week, but streaming Australian music can help. Each week, in partnership with Sounds Australia, Guardian Australia will add some 15 new songs to a playlist for you to put on repeat. “Australian music needs all the help it can get right now,” says Dom Alessio from Sounds Australia, who chose the songs for this playlist from artists who’ve played Sound Australia’s events. “Streaming an Australian song might seem like a really small and insignificant thing to do, but artists get paid when you listen to them, and cumulatively it can have a big impact.”
114	On 12 March, two weeks after Australia declared the coronavirus would become a pandemic and 47 days after the first case in Australia was detected in Melbourne, the World Health Organisation made it official. That night, in Melbourne, organisers of the Australian Grand Prix were scrambling to keep the event open despite an 11th hour order from Victoria’s chief health officer that they could run the race but had to turn spectators away. It would be the first major event in Australia to be cancelled by the coronavirus. Within 24 hours, almost every other flagship event planned for the next month would follow suit. This is the first 50 days of the shutdown. Day 1 – Friday 13 March Spectators queue outside Albert Park in Melbourne for two hours, before the organisers confirm the Australian Grand Prix has been cancelled. Six hours later, Scott Morrison and Australia’s premiers and chief ministers announce that mass gatherings – events with more than 500 participants – should not take place from Monday onward. They also announce the establishment of a national cabinet to respond to the coronavirus crisis. A level three travel warning is placed against the whole world, with Australians told to avoid unnecessary international travel. Spectators queue to gain entry ahead of the Formula 1 Australian Grand Prix 2020 at the Albert Park Circuit in Melbourne. The announcement is made in the Council of Australian Governments meeting (Coag), held in person in Sydney. It is the last time they are all in one room. The prime minister goes in for a handshake with the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, but is rebuffed. Saturday is the round-one NRL match between Morrison’s team, the Cronulla Sharks, and the South Sydney Rabbitohs. He tells reporters at the Coag press call at 4pm that he still intends to go. By 8pm, Morrison has reneged on his football attendance, saying it might be misinterpreted. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, has tested positive to coronavirus, but his cabinet colleagues are not tested. And the Melbourne Comedy festival, Melbourne Fashion festival and Sydney Royal Easter Show have been cancelled. Australia has 156 cases of coronavirus. Round-one NRL match between South Sydney Rabbitohs and Cronulla Sutherland Sharks at ANZ Stadium in Sydney, Saturday, 14 March, 2020. Day 3 – Sunday 15 March National cabinet holds its first meeting on the anniversary of the Christchurch massacre. Australia now has 250 cases. Quarantine rules are broadened. From midnight, all international arrivals are required to self-isolate for 14 days, unless they are airline or maritime crew, or transitioning through Australia to the Pacific Islands. The order extends to cruise ship passengers. States and territories will enforce these rules under public health orders. Morrison says there is unanimous agreement from states and territories that schools should remain open following the advice of national cabinet’s health advisory body, the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee. He says that once a shutdown measure is introduced it is likely to remain in place for six months. The next morning, Morrison does five media interviews. In four, he is asked why schools remain open. School attendance in NSW has dropped 25%. Day 6 – Wednesday 18 March Victorian school attendance has fallen by up to 50%. A fake text message is circulating warning the country would go into an immediate lockdown, and the prime minister bristles when asked about it. “Twitter is not real life … so don’t believe it,” he says. The national chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, says a two to four week shutdown called for by many commentators “does not achieve anything”. Prime minister Scott Morrison (right) and chief medical officer Brendan Murphy speak to media at Parliament House in Canberra, Wednesday, 18 March, 2020. National cabinet meets. Travel advice to the whole world is upgraded to level four: do not travel. Domestic travel is still allowed. Indoor gatherings of more than 100 people are now banned. Schools can remain open, but assemblies are cancelled. Singapore is held up as an example – it has managed the virus effectively while keeping schools open. Anzac Day ceremonies are cancelled. Restrictions are placed on visiting aged care facilities. Visits are capped at a maximum of two people per day, with visits to be kept to a short duration. Recently returned travellers, anyone with a respiratory infection, and children under 16 are told to stay away. In the evening, the Ruby Princess cruise ship arrives in Sydney harbour. Day 7 – Thursday 19 March At 6am health officials give the all-clear for the 2,700 passengers aboard the cruise ship Ruby Princess to disembark. About 110 have influenza-like symptoms. Three are swabbed, but the rest are not made to wait for the results. They go home, many boarding domestic flights to other states, carrying the virus with them. Within five weeks at least 662 passengers on the Ruby Princess will have tested positive to Covid-19 and 21 will have died. Cruise ship passengers disembark from the Ruby Princess at Circular Quay in Sydney, Thursday, 19 March, 2020. Later, Scott Morrison announces that Australia’s borders are now closed to non-citizens and residents. Australians are urged to return home as soon as possible. The Reserve Bank announces a $105bn boost to the economy and cuts the cash rate to 0.25%. The next day, after a national cabinet meeting, the ban on indoor gatherings is refined to include a requirement of 4sqm space per person. Restaurants will have to change their tables accordingly. Schools remain open, but Tasmania does not: the island state announces that anyone who enters will face a 14-day quarantine. Day 10 – Sunday 22 March The jobseeker payment is effectively doubled to a minimum base rate of $1,115.70, with an announcement of a fortnightly coronavirus support payment of $550. The payment will remain in place for six months. People queue outside a Centrelink office in Preston, Melbourne, 23 March 2020. It’s part of the $66bn second economic stimulus package, which includes a provision to allow sole traders and those eligible for welfare to draw down their superannuation by up to $10,000 a year for the next two years. Loans for small and medium sized businesses are announced. National cabinet meets and decides on the first major round of closures: all pubs, clubs, cafes and restaurants, excluding takeaway, will be closed from 12pm Monday. Gyms, indoor sporting venues, cinemas, casinos, nightclubs and entertainment venues are also closed. Schools remain open, but are encouraged to provide access to online education. Crowds at Bondi beach on Saturday are blamed for the “draconian measures to enforce social distancing” that will be introduced and policed by the states in coming weeks. Beachgoers at Sydney’s Bondi beach despite the threat of coronavirus, Friday, 20 March, 2020. The national cabinet meeting is preceded by matching announcements from the NSW and Victorian premiers, saying they are considering a ban on all non-essential services. Victoria and the ACT will close schools from Tuesday, starting the Easter school holidays early. Morrison says he is not annoyed. At the press conference following the national cabinet meeting, ABC political editor Andrew Probyn inadvertently becomes a TikTok meme. Australia passes 1,000 cases on Saturday. By Sunday it’s 1,316 cases – an increase of 213 in 24 hours. Twenty-six of those cases are from the Ruby Princess. On Monday, thousands of people queue for Centrelink. The queues start forming at 4am and stretch around the block. The pattern is repeated all week. Day 12 – Tuesday 24 March National cabinet decides on further restrictions. Auction houses, real estate auctions, eating in shopping centre food courts, amusement parks, play centres, beauty parlours, tattoo parlours, and haircuts that take longer than 30 minutes are banned. The haircut time limit is lifted two days later. Gatherings are restricted to groups of 10 when outdoors. That includes funerals. Weddings are limited to five people – the couple, the celebrant and two witnesses. Australians must stay home unless they’re going out for an essential purpose, and the definition of essential is broadened. “Now, if you ask me who is an essential worker?” Morrison says. “Someone who has a job.” Domestic travel restrictions on entering Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory come into force. Those who arrive after today will have to self-isolate for 14-days. Queensland is to follow on Wednesday. The international travel warning is upgraded to a travel ban. The next day, all non-urgent elective surgery is suspended. Shock jock Alan Jones, who usually shows little sympathy to those on welfare, says it should be easier to get the dole. In New Zealand, a four week lockdown is announced. It will begin on Thursday. Day 15 – Friday 27 March. Prince Charles and Boris Johnson have coronavirus. The United States passes China as the country with the most number of cases. Globally, the number of cases has topped half a million with 22,993 deaths. Australia’s total case tally has topped 3,000, doubling in just three days. The daily incidence peak is hit on 28 March. National cabinet announces that from midnight Saturday, all returning international travellers will have to complete their mandatory 14-day quarantine in a hotel. A ban on non-essential travel into remote Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory comes into effect. Day 17 – Sunday 29 March Gatherings are now limited to two people, excluding people who live together. Some states will take this further to ban people from interacting unless they are exercising together or acting as a carer. People over the age of 70 are advised to effectively self-isolate, as are people with chronic disease or comorbidities who are over the age of 60, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples over the age of 50. The national cabinet announces a moratorium on evictions from commercial or residential tenancies for six months, but enforcement is slow and varies between jurisdictions. The curve is beginning to flatten, with the rate of growth dropping from 35% to 15%. To date, 208,000 tests have been conducted, and 3,898 cases have been confirmed. About 98% of tests are negative. Australia is testing more than four times the number of people per head of population than the UK, and more people per head of population than South Korea. Day 18 – Monday 30 March The Australian government announces a $130bn wage subsidy package called jobkeeper. Eligible businesses will receive $1,500 per employee per fortnight, to be paid in full directly to the employee, if they can show a significant loss in revenue. It brings the total value of economic stimulus packages announced to $320bn, or 16.4% of GDP. Victoria and Queensland both issue their first fine on a business for breaching social distancing laws. States and territories release new public health orders, detailing the strict enforcement of the stay at home rules, with on-the-spot fines of $1,000 or more. Journalists spend the next few days seeking clarity on whether the laws restrict visits from romantic partners. Three days later, the federal government announces that childcare will be free for six months. Day 24 – Sunday 5 April Police in New South Wales announce a criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess cruise ship debacle, which is now the single largest source of coronavirus infections in Australia. Some 662 of the 5,687 coronavirus cases reported in Australia are from that ship, as are 11 of the 34 deaths. The global coronavirus tally passed 1 million cases two days ago. At 11.59pm the hard border in WA comes into effect. Only residents or those who meet a set criteria for entry are now allowed through. Queensland will strengthen it border restrictions from 11 April. NSW, Queensland and Victoria are stricter in their enforcement of social distancing rules than other states. Two days ago, the WA premier, Mark McGowan, was overcome with laughter at a description of a man in NSW being fined for stopping to buy a kebab on the way home from a run. Soon, police would be accused of being too heavy handed and discriminatory in their use of the unfettered powers to stop people and judge the reason for being outside. On 7 April, Scott Morrison says the Easter long weekend could cause another spike in cases. “Stay at home,” he says. “Failure to do so this weekend would completely undo everything we have achieved so far together, and potentially worse.” April brings a change in the type of questions asked at press conferences. Where in March reporters asked for tougher restrictions – (Why not an immediate four week lockdown? Why are schools still open?) – April sees calls for the lockdown measures to be lifted. Rightwing pundits reach for utilitarianism and argue the prime minister is letting his Christianity get in the way of economic pragmatism. Day 31 – Sunday 12 April Easter Sunday. There is an outbreak in Tasmania. The premier, Peter Gutwein, announces the immediate closure of two hospitals in the state’s north-west and orders 1,000 healthcare workers – and the 4,000 people they live with – to quarantine for 14 days. The area is now under the strictest lockdown provisions in the country. All non-essential business is banned. The North West Regional hospital is seen closed in Burnie, Tasmania, Tuesday, 14 April, 2020. The outbreak is traced back to two passengers of the Ruby Princess cruise ship, who were the first two people to die in Tasmania after testing positive to Covid-19. Murphy repeats rumours to a New Zealand parliamentary committee that the virus spread because healthcare workers held an illegal dinner party, but a police investigation would later find there was no evidence to suggest such a party occurred. The health services union says the spread was due to doctors and nurses working across infected wards. Five days later, the prime minister will also be slapped down by Tasmanian authorities for incorrectly suggesting a healthcare worker had deliberately withheld information from contact tracers. Day 35 – Thursday 16 April The first hearing of the royal commission into the summer bushfires, a crisis that was for one month the defining issue of the year, is held via videolink. The national cabinet agrees to lift social distancing restrictions if three conditions are met. They are: boosting the testing regime to include extensive surveillance or sentinel testing of asymptomatic people; stronger contact tracing, including the use of a tracing app; and improved local response capability to quickly shut down any new outbreaks. If that happens and the basic reproduction number remains below one – meaning that each infection leads to less than one new infection – then, in four weeks, restrictions may be lifted. Every state except Tasmania currently has a reproduction rate of less than one. Restrictions will loosen gradually, Morrison says. Singapore is now a warning: lift restrictions too quickly and you could face a second wave. Day 39 – Monday 20 April Western Australia and Queensland join South Australia and the Northern Territory in reporting no new cases of coronavirus. It’s the first day without a new case in WA since 21 February. South Australia has just made three days in a row, despite expanding its testing regime. Nationally, it’s the lowest daily new case count since early March, with just 26 new cases. For the past nine days, the average daily growth rate has been less than 1%. The curve is bent. More than two-thirds of the country’s 6,613 cases have now recovered, and 434,000 tests have been completed. The next day, the national cabinet announces it will lift the ban on many types of non-urgent elective surgery from 27 April. Virgin Australia, Australia’s second biggest airline, goes into administration. Virgin Australia Boeing 737-800 aircraft parked on one of the three runways at Sydney’s Kingsford Smith airport. Day 42 – Thursday 23 April The Ruby Princess departs Australia for the Philippines with 500 crew members onboard. A NSW inquiry investigating the debacle holds its second day of hearings. The tax office has approved 456,000 applications from people seeking early access to their superannuation, with an average withdrawal of $8,000. Centrelink has processed 587,686 jobseeker applications, more than they usually would in a year. More than 900,000 businesses have expressed interest in the jobkeeper payment, and 275,000 have made formal applications. Brendan Murphy tells a parliamentary select committee that to ease restrictions Australia would have to be able to “test like we’ve never tested before”. WA premier Mark McGowan, asked at a Perth press conference when he would ease restrictions, says: “It’s a funny thing. A few weeks ago I was literally being screamed at to lock down, lock down everything. Now the calls are that we need to open up.” He said that schools were expected to return to onsite learning from Monday and parents should demand a refund from private schools that don’t comply. The next day, Morrison rebukes the aged care sector for going above the recommended restrictions and denying visitors even when no outbreak has been detected. Murphy announces that all states have expanded their testing regimes, the first step in establishing sentinel testing. Responding to comments made by US president Donald Trump, Murphy says he would “caution against the injection of disinfectants” as a potential treatment for Covid-19. Another outbreak is unfolding at an aged care home in western Sydney. Day 44 – Saturday 25 April The prime minister’s Anzac Day address from the Australian War Memorial is broadcast live into homes because ceremonies and marches are cancelled. Instead, lit candles are placed in driveways. Vietnam veteran David Milligan takes a minute’s silence outside his home at dawn in Mallacoota, Far East Gippsland, Saturday, 25 April, 2020. The next day, the government releases the Covidsafe app, designed to assist contact tracing by making a record of everyone a user has been in contact with for more than 15 minutes. The information can only be accessed by state health authorities and is automatically deleted after 21 days. The use of the app is not compulsory, but it is linked to an easing of restrictions. “If we want to get back to sport then we need to download the app,” Morrison says. By Wednesday evening, the app has three million downloads and the federal government has a new catchphrase: “for a covid-safe Australia, download the Covidsafe app. Day 47 – Tuesday 28 April Gladys Berejiklian follows Mark McGowan and Annastacia Palaszczuk in announcing a relaxation of social distancing laws. Berejiklian says the change – which allows people to visit family and friends without being penalised – is a mental health measure. “I’ll still be standing outside the house when I visit my parents,” she says. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, says he does not intend to loosen his state’s lockdown provisions, which expire on 11 May. That’s also the target date for the AHPPC reviewing stay-at-home measures. In Western Australia, people are now allowed to gather in groups of 10 either indoors or outdoors. Hiking, boating, fishing, camping, and holding a picnic or a barbecue are all now permitted, but regional travel restrictions and the hard border remain in place. Four people die at western Sydney aged care home Newmarch House in a 24-hour period, bringing the number of deaths at that facility linked to the coronavirus to 11. Managers at the centre say they expect more deaths to follow. A makeshift memorial honouring residents who died from the coronavirus at Newmarch House, an aged care home in western Sydney, 30 April, 2020. The Logies are cancelled, followed by the Royal Melbourne Show. The number of cases in the United States passes one million, with a death toll of 58,220 – more than the number of US lives lost in the Vietnam War. Day 50 – Friday, 1 May The Australian Capital Territory enters the day with no active cases of Covid-19, with 103 people recovered and three dead. Loosened restrictions in New South Wales and Queensland take effect. North of the border, family groups are allowed to go for picnics or to a national park; to eat a takeaway meal outside instead of scurrying back into their homes; to take a leisure drive within a 50km radius of their home address; and to shop for frivolities. In New South Wales, people are allowed to have up to two visitors in their home, or visit other people. In the Northern Territory, which has not had a new case of Covid-19 in weeks, the parks are reopened. Fishing, camping, outdoor weddings and funerals and attending the local swimming pool are back on the cards. In two weeks’ time residents will be allowed to go to the pub, provided they only stay for two hours and also order food. By 18 June, according to a plan outlined by chief minister Michael Gunner, everything will be back to normal. The national cabinet moves forward its decision on easing restrictions to next Friday, 8 May. “We need to restart our economy, we need to restart our society. We can’t keep Australia under the doona, we need to move ahead,” Morrison says.
115	We are all in danger. But some of us are in more danger than others: physically, mentally, socially, economically. Not only from the virus itself but from some of the social and political responses to it. From First Nations people experiencing homelessness being issued with move-on notices to asylum seekers in detention, from frontline health workers to frontline retail workers, from casuals and contractors to visa holders, Covid-19, while imposing a common danger upon all of us, heightens the pre-existing contrasts in society, forcing us to focus on the glaring structural inequalities upon which our economy is built. The danger we are all in, and the unequal distribution of this danger, means that the ideological fixation on “going it alone” has been blown out of the water. The common danger, and the hyper-danger for some of us within it, poses a singular social question, a social question so all-encompassing that it resonates with the plethora of personal questions each of us has. How do we protect ourselves as a society? We cannot depend on a fractured society or a fragmented economy to deliver collective healing and health. Or jobs. Or sustainability. Or social morale. We also know that the bushfire crisis, since it is a symptom of the climate emergency, has not gone away. It is, to use the prime minister’s favoured concept, in hibernation. The Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz has recently written: ... the first priority is to restore our balance: provide more funding for the public sector, especially for those parts of it that are designed to protect against the multitude of risks that a complex society faces, and to fund the advances in science and higher-quality education, on which our future prosperity depends … Even as we emerge from this crisis, we should be aware that some other crisis surely lurks around the corner. We can’t predict what the next one will look like – other than it will look different from the last. Alongside strengthening the social security system and expanding the wage subsidy to include casuals and visa holders the commonwealth government needs to expand the public sector. Not only to create jobs but to protect the community. We need, as a massive structural augmentation, a significantly enhanced and expanded public sector. I’m not just talking about an expansion of infrastructure and staffing levels; we need to re-imagine the public sphere, expanding our view of its role in building a common future based on the common good, a view that has been displaced by the false construct of austerity coupled with the ideology of “the market knows (and does everything) best”. I write this at a time when the government has shamefully allowed the austerity impulse to kick in vis a vis the public sector, imposing an economically irrational and socially harmful wage freeze on public sector workers. It is not my intention to provide a comprehensive list of infrastructure projects. Because we need a robust, participatory and transparent process by which this is determined (as opposed to the sports rorts model!), rationally mapped out on the basis of current and projected social and economic need. This is work that must begin now. The first priority should be the provision of a significant social and economic infrastructure investment to First Nations communities, the shape of which, and this cannot be emphasised too strongly, should be determined by those communities. As Lorena Allam points out: “Crowding in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities occurs at around three times the rate of the non-Indigenous population, with over 115,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander households living in overcrowded homes nationwide.” We need a massive injection of public resources into the construction of public housing. The Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute has estimated that, facing a shortfall of 433,000 social housing dwellings, we need to triple our stock of social housing by 2036. If we fail to meet this housing need we are looking down the barrel of a worsening homelessness and housing stress crisis. Bad for the economy. Disastrous for people’s lives. Other obvious and urgent areas of expansion include Services Australia (building on the government’s recently announced boost to Centrelink staff, whilst cognisant of the staffing cuts since 2013 and the ridiculous capping of the APS to 2006-07 staffing levels or below) and the public health system (physical infrastructure and staffing levels, including community health and aged and community care). Also, the progressive replacement of the jobactive network with a fit-for-purpose commonwealth employment service, a good opportunity to scrape such barnacles as the hyper-exploitative PaTH, the dead-end work-for-the-dole, the inherently racist Community Development Program and the punitive ParentsNext. The centrepiece of reconstruction should be a social guarantee, with full employment at its heart. The Curtin government’s 1945 white paper on full employment saw an expanded public sector as a means not only of creating jobs but of building social and economic infrastructure. The times demand a 21st century vision akin to this. A vision that recognises and properly remunerates the heavily gendered work of caring, that values the role of arts workers in the public sphere, that treats broadband as essential infrastructure (and, given that it is right now the only highway we get anywhere on, removes the bloody tolls and ditches the digital divide!). We should address the obscene levels of casualisation and precarity, invest in community infrastructure, social services, disability services. We should have a vision with an actual industry policy that embraces the opportunities of a post-carbon economy, a vision that enables and encourages equitable access to higher education and that values and boosts research and innovation instead of lazily leaving it to a private sector that cannot be expected to fill the strategic role that government has so spectacularly abrogated. Although, as the economist Mariana Mazzucato points out, this abrogation is exactly what has been expected of governments according to the neoliberal framework conjured up by narrow interests: “Since the 1980s, governments have been told to take a back seat and let business steer and create wealth, intervening only for the purpose of fixing problems when they arise.” We have a right to expect more from government. We have a right to expect government to do what markets cannot, namely, achieve collectively what we cannot achieve alone: social and economic protection for all of us. A social guarantee encompasses all that makes people feel human and valued as members of a society. It means no one missing out on the essentials of life: a place to live, a place to work (and decent income support for those who cannot), a place to learn, a place to heal. It means, for example, an overhaul of education funding so that public schools and the education workforce are properly invested in, rather than being allowed to languish in fulfilment of the ideological fantasy that giving more to already well-resourced private schools is somehow equitable. As for Tafe, successive governments have allowed this national treasure to be denuded in the false interests of competition. It is time to right this wrong. The days of outsourcing the work of the public sector to labour hire companies and big consultancy firms must end. The days of using our social security system to harm and harass people through vicious policies such as robodebt, instead of helping them, must end. The days of running down the CSIRO and such research centres as the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre must end. The French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu defines neoliberalism as “a program for destroying collective structures which may impede the pure market logic”. It is this ideology that has been responsible for the piecemeal dismantling of the public sphere. It is reality itself that now calls for an historic shift. • Dr John Falzon is senior fellow, inequality and social justice at Per Capita.

116	How will you become a good ancestor? Kunggalu and Birri Gubba poet, actress, storyteller and great-great-grandmother, the late Maureen Watson, used to say we must all ask ourselves this question. In uncertain times, as Aboriginal people are bunkering down in their communities to protect the vulnerable from coronavirus, especially elders who are the keepers of important cultural knowledge, some are finding solace in being out on country that is closed to tourists. In South Australia, the Ngarrindjerri elder Major “Moogy” Sumner is spending time with his extended family, and learning how to deliver cultural lessons on “the Zoom”. “This virus has interrupted ceremony, everything that we do, our right to travel across the country,” Sumner says. “But you can learn things from this.” Sumner is 72, a Ngarrindjerri cultural ambassador whose country is along the Murray river in the Coorong. He’s an actor, on the London stage last year in Andrew Bovell’s adaptation of Kate Grenville’s The Secret River, and he has travelled Europe repatriating the remains of his ancestors, most recently from Leipzig, Edinburgh and London in 2019. Sumner’s wings are clipped for now, though, as we talk about survival and resilience on the phone from his home in Adelaide, while he holds his sleepy two-year-old grandson on his lap. “We’ve lived in this country for thousands and thousands of years and we’ve come up against all sorts of things within our existence in this land. Even though this is a bad virus, we’ll get through it because Aboriginal people don’t realise how strong we are,” Sumner says. “A lot of people don’t realise, just because we’re not up to number one on the western society’s measuring stick. But we know how to survive in this land, we’ve been here for a long time and the laws have been there with us, how we respected each other, how we did all sorts of ceremonies. We should really get back to that, because at the moment we’re living in a way that is really alien to us.” Sumner points out that Europeans may have been in Australia for 250 years on the east coast, but contact history is very recent elsewhere. Songlines are unbroken. “It’s only a 100 years here, and further north it may be only 90 years. It’s not that long. Even here in South Australia, we are still practising our ceremonies, we’re still practising men and women ceremonies. “We are dancing about the land, about healing the land and healing the rivers. But most of all, we are dancing about healing ourselves, because we’ve been damaged, our culture has been damaged. We have, as nations of people across this country been damaged, but by using ceremony, we can bring ourselves back to the land,” he says. Sumner was among hundreds who gathered at a healing ceremony along the Baaka (Darling river) late last year, worried for the health of the Murray-Darling system, from Queensland to the Coorong. “Some of the Murray cod [who died] were over a hundred years old. They died in their own environment. And I thought, when is it our turn? Because Ngarrindjerri, we consider some of the fish as ngarritji, which means ‘my best friend’. They are ngarritji and people would translate that to mean “totems”. When our totems die, when is it our turn? Is it happening now, when we’re dying in our own environment? “We need to take notice about the world, about the environment, about diseases. “When did the first really bad disease come to this country? With Captain Cook.” “Ngarrindjerri have a word for spirit that lives inside of us. And that spirit lives in our stomach area. And we call that spirit the miwi. It’s the spirit that tells us right from wrong. Everyone’s got it. You know when you feel there’s something wrong, you don’t feel it in your mind or in your heart. You feel it in your stomach. And in some of us, that spirit is gone. That fire has gone out. We need to rekindle and relight that fire in a way that people will have that feeling back. “As elders around the world, we need to teach, so that later on down the track all these children, they’ll be respected elders. “When we look to the future, we have to take our culture with us. We don’t leave it back there, we bring it with us so that every day we practise it. It’s not a religion, it’s not a church or anything. It’s just things we do. Lockdown is an opportunity to think differently about ways to transmit culture, Sumner says, including embracing technology. “I’ve got a lot of the schools where I do storytelling, now they ask me the other day if I’d like to do it by using that Zoom. “I’m going to take a small – what’s it called? – laptop outside and set it up there and I’m going to sit down, line the camera up on me doing carving. “I’m doing a thing with the education department now looking at the science around the returning boomerang. We’re gonna put little led lights on the top of the boomerang and throw them at nighttime so you can watch the angles as it goes, and we’re gonna have drones and we’re going to videotape it for the kids to learn the science of the boomerang. “So there’s a lot of stuff we can do with our culture. You know, we can take it everywhere.” Sumner pauses, thinking aloud about all the millions of people trying to deal with the virus and the fear and anxiety it generates. “What I’d say is learn your culture, learn who you are. Because what we’re doing today, everyone forgets where we come from. “We all had a traditional way that we lived. We all had songs. We all had dance. We all had our own laws designed for that country. They were designed so that we would live and respect the country, but also respect ourselves. “While we’re in isolation, learn and practise. Start practising stuff that you never practised before or didn’t know about your own culture, your own ceremonies. Start practising them with your family that you live with. “Keep learning, keep teaching,” he says.
117	Oxfam Australia is preparing to cut close to half of its workforce, citing financial difficulties stemming from years of reduced fundraising income and a “persistent decline in overseas aid budget” well before the coronavirus pandemic hit. Oxfam sends aid around the world, including funding work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in Australia and fair trade producers in 18 countries. Guardian Australia has confirmed that discussions began with staff earlier this week, and Oxfam had decided to redesign the organisation. The charity is planning to reduce the number of full-time staff from 185 to 94 between now and October. Oxfam Australia chief executive Lyn Morgain said it was an “exceptionally challenging financial environment”, with the charity having a reduction in donations during the summer bushfires in Australia, leading into the coronavirus pandemic. “Oxfam Australia entered the coronavirus crisis in a weakened financial position because of multiple factors that are impacting on the sector, including the fallout from the Australian bushfires, several years of reduced fundraising income and a persistent decline in the overseas aid budget,” she said in a statement. “Oxfam’s life-saving work is needed now more than ever to respond to the coronavirus and multiple other crises that threaten to increase the number of people living in poverty and exacerbate inequality. “But at the same time, the economic downturn caused by the pandemic has underscored the urgent need for changes that were already under way at Oxfam.” Final decisions about the roles are yet to be made, with staff consultations under way, but Morgain said in order to be financially stable, Oxfam needed to reduce costs. “Incredibly tough decisions are being made and there will be job losses. We know this is an extremely difficult time for our dedicated and passionate staff – and these decisions in no way reflect their performance.” The charity closed its Australian retail outlets mid last year. In 2018-19, the charity reported $86.9m in revenue, the majority from public donations, followed by grant income. In its annual report Oxfam said it had experienced a deteriorating working capital position, and was disheartened by federal government reduction in the aid program. A spokeswoman for Oxfam said the charity was still working out whether it was eligible for the federal government’s jobkeeper program. “Like other organisations across the sector, Oxfam is assessing its eligibility for the jobkeeper program. We welcomed clarification offered to international aid organisations last Friday and the extension of dates for applications to next Friday.”
118	Fair play to the Premier League, EFL and everybody trying to plot a cautious way back to normal life, but amid their expert advice‑taking and scenario‑modelling it feels increasingly that they should also be stress-testing the alternative – calling the season off. The more savvy professionals involved are exercising caution about the government’s position, after another oddly judged intervention this week by Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, who said that – health guidance permitting – he wanted to “get football up and running – as soon as possible”. Bill Shankly’s classic quip about the importance of football when manager of the club who could still be crowned 2020 champions whatever happens, was cast in terribly serious perspective after the horrors of Heysel and Hillsborough in the 1980s. Now, considering whether to play professional football in the middle of a pandemic is literally a matter of life and death. One of football’s perennial failings is to inflate its obsession into a bubble in which the great game’s dramas, outcomes, personalities and controversies seal it off into an alternative world which can feel somehow as significant as everything else. Hearing Boris Johnson mention “our current success” in dealing with coronavirus, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, deny that allowing the virus to run through the population and achieve “herd immunity” was ever “part of their plan” and the refusal by the government to admit to a single failure, they often appear to be creating a bubble of their own. For people not in the front line of the NHS or caring professions, and not stricken personally by the virus, lockdown can make the horror of this situation feel unreal. But 27,000 people in the UK have died, each one a tragedy and grievous blow to a family. Into the second week in March, Dowden and his government were still encouraging people to go to matches and the Cheltenham Festival, based on scientists’ advice that “mass gatherings” pose a low risk of virus transmission. Prof Neil Ferguson of Imperial College explained that with reference to the Liverpool v Atlético Madrid match played on 11 March. “Some people will have got infected,” he said of the transmission potential of mass gatherings, “and if it hadn’t happened they wouldn’t have been.” But he went on to explain that “at a population level, stopping them has a marginal impact”. But in normal circumstances we do not think of a risk to some lives as “marginal” because they are not many as a proportion of the whole population; normally everything is aimed at saving and preserving life. Most of the talk in football now is about how players and staff could be tested, somehow housed in a sterile environment, how they might ingeniously be tiptoed into empty stadiums while the rest of the population are still largely housebound. The mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, was criticised by the club itself for raising public health concerns about games restarting, but however in-depth the planning may be to avoid people massing outside the stadium or gathering instinctively to celebrate, he was sounding a genuine alarm about risks. To be balanced against those lethal hazards are the benefits of trying so hard to stage matches again. As seven weeks have gone by since football suspended itself on 13 March, against the advice of Dowden and his government that it was fine to carry on into that weekend, the significance of promotion, relegation and Champions League qualification has been put into perspective by the pandemic’s elemental threat. Now the urge to play is articulated more as a grim job of having to get the season done to avoid difficult conversations with broadcasters, and be able to keep their money. After Dowden spoke up in parliament, more than one senior football executive told the Guardian this week they felt uneasy, as if the government needs some good news, some entertainment for the masses, and that lies behind their desire to get the Premier League playing “as soon as possible”. Dowden said in parliament that this would “help release resources through the rest of the system”, but the EFL is understood to be baffled by that, as no more money will go down the football pyramid now if the Premier League starts playing again. In France, where the number of people killed by Covid-19 is lower than in Britain, the government has banned team sports until September and, however much the odd club such as Lyon may grumble, Ligue 1 is cancelled, and the summer is cleared of yet another complication, to try to address the virus. If that were to happen here, however much football people are missing the game and would love current realities to be different, many people could usefully calm down. The financial situation, of course difficult, will probably be just about manageable. If that did happen, the Premier League could concentrate on being true to the principle it has stressed throughout and did again on Friday: “The thoughts of all are with those directly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic,” and: “The Premier League’s priority is the health and safety of players, coaches, managers, club staff, supporters and the wider community.”

120	Like a lot of people, I am not sleeping as well as I was a few months ago. I am still able to nod off fairly easily, and unlike many, my sleep is not often broken with fits of staring anxiously at the ceiling. I am, however, waking up much earlier, well before dawn. I live in a very quiet suburb at the best of times – the nearest train line and major highway half an hour’s walk away. But lately, in the pre-dawn darkness, the world outside my window is as still as death: no car engines warming up in commuters’ driveways, no pounding footfall of joggers on a pre-work run. All is unnervingly silent, as if the world is broken and I am alone with my dark thoughts. But then I hear those first, welcome notes. Some mornings it’s the comforting soft carolling of the Australian magpie, others it’s the repetitive, urgent piping of gangs of noisy miners. Soon they will be joined by the silvery song of the grey butcherbird, the smaller cousin of the magpie whose large beak tricks people into thinking they are baby kookaburras. The local pied currawongs might chip in with their evocative chimes resonating in the stillness. The screech of rainbow lorikeets hurtling towards their morning feast of nectar from the neighbourhood flowering gums punctuate the air. The sepulchre of night is peeled back as the world turns towards the light of the new day. Listening to the contributions of each member of the voluble choir spurs feelings of wonder and gratefulness to be alive on our sublime planet. The dawn chorus reconnects me to life; a sense of hope returns. It is my favourite moment of each of these strange, new days. Birds link sky and earth, they migrate across hemispheres, traverse the vast oceans. From Indigenous creation stories to Aristophanes to the Norwegian myths of Odin and his two ravens that report daily to him about their flights around the globe, birds were considered as messengers, connecting us to other realms. Roman auguries took this literally, interpreting bird behaviour as signs from the gods. In our noisy, industrial society, birdsong has largely been drowned out, all too easy to ignore. However, in the quietude of lockdown and isolation many of us have once again become attuned to their sound breaking the silence. BirdLife Australia has been inundated with people wanting to share or have identified the birds who have been visiting their garden. One Melbourne birdwatcher started an online movement, #birdthefeckathome which encourages people to record birds they have seen in their backyards. Since launching at the end of March, the site has logged over 2,600 species – around a quarter of the world’s birds. In the radio talkback segments I’ve been doing, callers are freaking out that the birds “were going crazy” but almost all the behaviours described were fairly standard for Australian birds who are a gregarious and outlandish lot. The difference is, confined to our homes all day, surrounded by a quiet most of us have never experienced, we are noticing for the first time the daily soap operas of the feathered characters we share our surrounds with. Even in the high-rise midst of our city centres people are noticing cockatoos, currawongs and pigeons living pretty much as they did before the virus. Birdsong still welcomes the dawn every morning and I find enormous comfort in that. This is why on Sunday I plan to rise early and acknowledge the joy those sounds bring as part of International Bird Chorus Day. It was started by British naturalist Chris Baines in 1984 who roped in some friends to celebrate a significant birthday by joining him to listen for the first bird calls of the day. At this time of year, the migrant songbirds have returned to the English countryside and fill the air with their sweet, lilting warblings. Though some, such as Adam Lindsay Gordon and his “songless, bright birds” or more recently – and more delightfully – Sam Neill and his raven impersonations might regard Australian birds as a raucous cacophony, the fact is that songbirds evolved in Australia and our birds, as vocally splendid as they are boldly marked, do not need the impetus of spring to belt out a squawk or two. On Sunday I will be listening for these comforting, yet bittersweet sounds – palpable reminders of the natural world I am cut off from, while at the same time providing me an essential connection to the world I once knew, the world to which I want to return.

121	We’re already being swamped with ideas about “reforms” needed to recover from the pandemic crisis. But the word reform is like gift wrap – a handy cover for any offering, thought-through or otherwise. Perhaps we should ditch the word entirely, and with it the forest of feelpinions about what governments “must” do to advance an author’s previously-held ideological positioning in the post-corona world. Imagine if we took just two lessons from the way Australian governments responded to the coronavirus: that good decisions are made when they consider the evidence and the best available expert advice; and that policy-making can accommodate reasonable differences of opinion, without becoming a “war”. Think, as Laura Tingle did in a piece for the ABC’s 7.30 this week, of the difference it would make if interviewers and commentators allowed room for discussion of complex and competing ideas, before demanding that politicians rule them “in” or “out”, or before finding a backbencher who will say they might cross the floor on a policy that conflicts with their ideological prejudice – even if that policy hasn’t yet been outlined. Now consider if those principles were applied to climate policy in Australia. I concede that’s quite a leap given the past decade of mind-numbing debate, during which experts have struggled to get a look in. But in the background, some have been giving it a shot. For six years now leading business, environmental, investor, union, farming and social welfare groups have been trying, largely in vain, to create a space for a sensible discussion about global heating, and to give Australian politicians a way to retreat from the self-defeating culture war that has scuppered all attempts at policy. They wouldn’t put it this way, but in effect the environmentalists, desperate for Australia to make some meaningful move towards reducing emissions, and the business groups, desperate for some kind of investment certainty, have been trying to save Australia’s politicians from themselves. The starting point for the Australian Climate Roundtable’s deliberations is that Australia needs to reach net zero emissions, and that delaying action just increases the cost of reaching that goal. Unremarkable propositions in any fact-based forum, but in some Coalition circles, still close to heresy. Now the roundtable, including its business members, argues that this post-corona reconstruction is a chance to speed up decarbonising the economy. The Business Council of Australia chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, argued in an opinion piece that the post-corona discussion should divest itself of “ideological constraints”. “In resuscitating our economy, we can tackle some of our most vexed problems. Every dollar we invest in energy should be a dollar towards a lower carbon economy and lower energy bills,” she wrote. And expert evidence about what might be possible has been flooding in by the day. The Australian Energy Market Operator this week released its long awaited “renewable integration study”, which found Australia could accommodate levels of up to 75% “instant” penetration of wind and solar in its main grid by 2025 – that we have the know-how, but need to update market and regulatory settings. Think about that next time someone starts burbling on about the impossibility of a renewable-dependent grid coping “when the wind don’t blow and the sun don’t shine”. Less than a year after an election in which Bill Shorten’s target of 45% renewables by 2030 was attacked for being “unachievable” and “economy wrecking”, the expert market operator says 75% is technically achievable – and in just five years time. And then there was the advice from the International Energy Agency this week that renewable electricity will be the only energy source resilient to the biggest global energy shock in 70 years, triggered by the pandemic. The Morrison government is supposed to be working on a “roadmap” towards some kind of long-term emissions reduction policy, understandably delayed while it deals with the pandemic. It could draw on the work of a bunch of expert groups who have already had a go – the latest Climateworks report released earlier this month found that net zero emissions by 2035 is possible in Australia, using technologies that are mostly already mature and available. The CSIRO’s roadmap released last year found there was no trade-off between economic growth and transitioning to zero emissions, and in fact strong action could lead to GDP growth, an increase in real wages and net zero emissions by 2050. But then, apparently pre-empting his own policy, and contradicting his own government’s claim to be “technology neutral”, the energy minister, Angus Taylor, has spent the week calling for a “gas-fired recovery”, variously advocating more gas-peaking plants, more long-term gas supply for manufacturers and more onshore gas production. The details of what he’s advocating remain opaque, but as the Grattan Institute’s energy expert Tony Wood points out, renewed suggestions of government intervention are only likely to deter investment, presumably the opposite of what Taylor is seeking. If there’s a coherent policy in there somewhere, it really is time for the government to unwrap it. The experts have been waiting for years, and it turns out that listening to them is a good idea.
122	Matt Williams’s son Harvey was born five weeks earlier than expected, on a leap day, 29 February, and ever since, his aunts and uncles and cousins have been waiting to see him. Young Harvey, who is in good health, was due on 1 April, but that early arrival gave him and his family, especially the grandparents, a brief, lucky window to meet him for the first time before nearly everything closed. On Friday, New South Wales partially relaxed its restrictions so that two adults (and any dependent children) can visit any other household – as long as you still keep your physical distance. On Saturday, Queenslanders will be allowed to travel up to 50km for recreation, like picnics or exercise, and the national parks will be reopened. Western Australia relaxed its own laws on Monday. For Matt and his wife Julia, in Sydney, this means they can go down the road to visit his sister, and introduce Harvey to his uncle and cousins. But they’re playing it safe, and won’t be taking him to see his grandparents for at least a few weeks more. “It is a very interesting time to bring a young person in the world,” Williams says. “The current situation in some hospitals is even the father can’t go in with the birthing mothers – so we were very lucky to have missed that. For Lisa Villani, Friday’s relaxation of restrictions means she can see her friend Deb Mansfield, who is recovering from surgery. Mansfield, 43, is a visual artist and former university lecturer, who now works in the disability sector. The pair met seven years ago and, until the shutdown, worked together at a pottery workshop. “In some of my toughest times, Deb has been the family in Sydney I didn’t have. She checks in. She delivers baked goods. She sends gifts,” Villani says. A few weeks ago, Mansfield visited (from 1.5 metres away, Villani adds) and told her they had found a growth on her ovary. She went in a week later for surgery. Before the hospital visit, they had kept in touch through a virtual passata-making class. Now they can’t wait to do the same in person. “I felt so helpless at a distance, not being able to see her or support her in the lead-up to and after her surgery,” Villani says. As soon as the new rules were announced, she invited Mansfield over for dinner. In Byron Bay, Damian Brady, 39, and wife Lisa Webb, 36, say that the restrictions on gatherings have been especially hard on their young kids – who have been missing their friends. “We pulled Harry, our oldest, out of daycare as soon as the virus started spreading in Australia,” Brady says. “It’s been a month and a half since he played with another kid. It’s difficult to explain to Harry why he can’t get close to people or play on playgrounds, and all his social activities like daycare, swimming lessons and circus arts stopped cold. Thankfully our youngest is only four months old so it hasn’t affected her much.” But as parents of two children, Brady and Webb are looking forward to the break as much as for themselves as the kids. “The last time we had a catch-up with any friends for any longer than a few minutes was sometime in February,” he says. “For my wife and I, it’s just been extremely isolating. We can talk to neighbours at a distance, but for most part it’s just the four of us in a house 24/7. We rarely went out before things changed, but it was always an option if we needed a break.” And the family reunions will still have to wait. The pair are originally from Queensland, and the state border is still closed to people who aren’t residents or essential workers. “Most of our friends and all the grandparents are in Brisbane,” Brady says. It shows how, though the lockdowns are partially relaxed, there is still much that people can’t or aren’t quite ready to do yet. Regardless, any outing feels like a blessing. “We won’t go all out – for us it’s about extending our isolation circle just a little to feel a bit more human,” Brady says. “Harry being able to play with another kid is something I’m really looking forward to. I know he is.”
123	A day after armed protesters against Michigan’s stay-at-home order entered the statehouse in Lansing, Donald Trump once again expressed support for the rightwing movement. Michigan’s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, should he said “make a deal” with the demonstrators. “The governor of Michigan should give a little, and put out the fire,” the president wrote in a tweet on Friday morning. “These are very good people, but they are angry. They want their lives back again, safely! See them, talk to them, make a deal.” Some of the demonstrators in Lansing on Thursday carried assault rifles, causing alarm among legislators. Some protesters, many without face coverings, entered the statehouse and demanded to be let on to the House floor, which is not allowed. The gallery was closed to the public to allow room for representatives and reporters to spread apart. Some demonstrators in the Senate gallery were openly carrying guns, which is legal. One senator said some armed men shouted at her. Some senators wore bulletproof vests. Outside, speakers took turns addressing a crowd on the statehouse lawn and drivers leaned on their horns, a repeat of what occurred on 15 April but not close to the thousands who participated in vehicles that day, paralyzing traffic for miles. Trump expressed support for that protest and similar rallies in other states. In one tweet, Trump appealed to supporters of gun rights when he wrote: “LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!” Many of his critics accused him of inciting violence against Democratic governors and lawmakers. Tweets about a potential armed conflict with the federal government increased in the hours after the “liberate” tweets were sent. At the White House later on Friday, press secretary Kayleigh McEnany was asked if it was appropriate for the president to express support for protests in which “long guns” were carried. McEnany answered that the president supported the right to protest within the law and while following federal social distancing guidelines. Shanon Banner, a Michigan state police spokeswoman, said statehouse protesters who did not wear masks or distance themselves were not issued tickets. Whitmer is rated as a possible vice-presidential pick for Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee to face Trump in November. In Lansing on Thursday, placards read “Shut down the lockdown”, “No work no freedom” and “Tyrants get the rope”. Some people wore the historic “Don’t Tread On Me” flag as a cape. Others chanted “Lock her up”, in reference to the governor. Some wore Trump’s Make America Great Again hats or carried signs supporting him. Banner estimated there were 400 to 700 protesters and said they were “peaceful” overall. One was arrested, for assaulting another demonstrator. Inside the statehouse, the Republican-led Michigan legislature refused to extend the state’s coronavirus emergency declaration and voted to authorize a lawsuit challenging Whitmer’s authority and actions to combat the pandemic. The governor responded with orders stating under one law that an emergency still exists, while declaring a new 28-day state of emergency under another law. The declarations are important because they are the foundation for Whitmer’s stay-at-home measure, and other directives aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. Late on Thursday, Whitmer extended the closure of bars, casinos and other public places through 28 May. She also continued a ban on dine-in service at restaurants. The virus that causes Covid-19 has infected more than 41,000 Michigan residents and contributed to the deaths of 3,789, many in the Detroit area. Republicans accused Whitmer of ignoring their input. The house speaker, Lee Chatfield, of Levering, said the death toll was “terrible”, but other lives had been “negatively impacted unnecessarily because of how we have handled this pandemic. We believe we you can prioritize public health yet be reasonable in your approach to fighting Covid.” “We can no longer allow one person to make decisions for 10 million people,” said the Senate majority leader, Mike Shirkey, of Clarklake. Democrats opposed the legislation as an unconstitutional “political stunt”. “We must ensure that our state can respond quickly and decisively to a situation that changes day by day,” said the representative Tyrone Carter, a Detroit Democrat who recovered from Covid-19. “That means ensuring that our governor has the emergency powers necessary to lead us in this fight.” Whitmer accused Republicans of “putting their heads in the sand and putting more lives and livelihoods at risk”. “I’m not going to let that happen,” she said.
124	A bipartisan group of House lawmakers investigating Amazon for possible antitrust violations have demanded that Jeff Bezos testify before Congress to address statements by the company that “appear to be misleading, and possibly criminally false or perjurious”. “Although we expect that you will testify on a voluntary basis, we reserve the right to resort to compulsory process if necessary,” seven leaders of the House judiciary committee, including the chair Jerry Nadler, wrote in a letter to the Amazon CEO on Friday. Representative David Cicilline, the chair of the House’s antitrust subcommittee who has been leading investigations into the major internet platforms, further stated on Twitter that he is considering a referral to prosecutors. “As CEO and founder of the company, [Jeff Bezos] must be accountable for Amazon’s record of dishonesty before Congress,” he tweeted. “In light of the gravity of this situation, I am also considering whether a perjury referral is warranted.” While Amazon had already been a subject of the antitrust subcommittee’s investigation, pressure on the company increased following the publication of a Wall Street Journal investigation into the company’s use of data to compete with sellers on its marketplace. Amazon was launched as an e-commerce site where customers could buy products directly from Amazon itself, but in 2000 it began allowing third-party retailers to sell goods through the site as well. The move to running a “marketplace” allowed Amazon to increase the range of products offered on its site, while giving sellers access to Amazon’s vast customer base. In 2019, Bezos told shareholders that third-party sellers accounted for more than half (58%) of the physical gross merchandise sold on Amazon. But the situation caused unease among antitrust campaigners and advocates for fair competition, especially as Amazon moved more aggressively into selling private label goods that compete directly with marketplace sellers. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a fierce critic of the company, has compared Amazon’s position with regard to the marketplace as akin to being “both the umpire and a player in the game”. In July 2019, Nate Sutton, the associate general counsel for Amazon, provided sworn testimony to congress that Amazon does “not use any seller data to compete with” third-party sellers or to inform decisions about launching its private label brands. But more than 20 former employees of the company’s private label brands told the Wall Street Journal that it was “standard operating practice” for Amazon employees use data about individual sellers to inform decisions about their own products. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company has previously denied misleading Congress and has said that it is investigating the “serious allegations of employee misconduct” described in the Journal’s report. “Amazon often acts as though it’s above the law,” said Stacy Mitchell, the co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. “Today, the House judiciary committee firmly demonstrated that it’s not.” Mitchell also testified before the House committee, at the same hearing in which Sutton made his disputed statement. “Amazon doesn’t just dominate markets,” she said at the time. “Through its control of essential infrastructure, it has assumed governing authority over a growing share of our commerce … Amazon has the power to regulate, tax, and punish Americans engaged in trade … To restore competition and safeguard our liberty, we need to both restructure and regulate Amazon.”
125	The Premier League’s clubs put on a united front during a three-and-a-half-hour video conference on Friday saying they remained determined to find a way to complete the season in the face of the Covid-19 crisis, with the use of neutral stadiums without fans now a prerequisite. But the harmony is not complete, with more than one club privately feeling the campaign ought to end because the obstacles to the hoped-for resumption in mid-June are simply too great. The principal concern is whether playing on would put the health of the players, club staff members and, by extension, their families at risk. The Manchester City striker Sergio Agüero said on Thursday that he was “scared” to finish the campaign for this reason and there are other players who share that fear. The Professional Footballers’ Association has made it plain that the safety of the players is its overriding concern; it will not contemplate putting them in harm’s way and the Guardian understands some players want the union to make a stand on their behalf. On the other hand, there are many more players who do want to continue. As on so many points, consensus is difficult to achieve. The Premier League issued a lengthy statement after the conference call and one line stood out. “It was agreed that the PFA, LMA, players and managers are key to this process and will be further consulted,” it said. The PFA knows that what the government and Premier League want is fundamental and the government has said football should return as soon as it is safe to do so; this is partly for the lift that it would give to the population. The government on Friday began a set of meetings with sporting bodies to map a route towards resumptions. There are players and club staff members who think the resumption of the season is wishful thinking; they cannot see how the rates of infection will drop to a manageable level quickly enough but, for now, it is a waiting game until the government indicates next Thursday whether they can ease the current lockdown. The Premier League will meet again next Friday. Eight to 10 stadiums are being identified for use as neutral venues. Almost all are expected to be Premier League grounds and clubs would not play in their own stadium. The move follows advice from police but not all clubs support it. Stadiums chosen will be those granted licences by the sports grounds safety authority. That will take into account factors such as their suitability for respecting physical distancing inside the stadium, for keeping people away from the outside of the stadium and local infection rates. There was a preference articulated for grounds – such as Manchester City’s Etihad Stadium and Brighton’s Amex Stadium – which are away from highly populated urban centres. The league aims to ensure that clubs would not have to travel long distances and travel be as equally spread as possible. The conference call went into detail on proposed plans for a safe return to training and playing, including protocols around testing and creating a sterile environment for players and staff. Protocols are still being worked on for a return to full training and matches and there is an understanding the players’ views must be considered. On Thursday Brighton’s Glenn Murray described the idea of wearing face masks in training as “farcical” but it is understood the detail presented was well received. All 20 clubs suggested they were committed to continue with the season, with the sense among some that if a restart is not possible now then it may not be later either. Those clubs that have reservations against resumption chose not to speak out. None of the issues that have so far split clubs – from the extension of contracts to concerns over player welfare – were raised. With no vote taken on which way to proceed, pending advice from government, the key meeting passes to next week. If the League is to stick to its preferred outcome of a return to training on 18 May and matches from 8 June, however, the window for finding a way forward is narrowing. The League said: “The clubs reconfirmed their commitment to finishing the 2019-20 season, maintaining integrity of the competition and welcomed the government’s support.” Bobby Barnes, the PFA’s deputy chief executive, said earlier in the week: “We have reiterated that players are not just footballers but partners, fathers, mothers, sons and daughters, who share the same health concerns as everyone else during this pandemic. “We have been assured of the intentions of all that there would be no resumption unless guarantees of safety could be given to the players. The overriding principle for all parties is the healthy and safety of all participants on and off the field and, of course, the wider public.”
126	The government said it passed its 100,000 tests per day target, amid claims the tally has been artificially boosted. At the daily press briefing Matt Hancock said as of 9am today there were 122,347 tests in the UK, a significant rise on Thursday’s figure of 81,611. However, the HSJ reported that the government was including home-testing kits sent out by post in the tally of tests to reach the target, even if the recipient has not yet provided and returned their sample. It was claimed that, until recently, tests were only recorded in the daily count once they had been sent to a laboratory for analysis. The government, however, denied there had been a change. Deprived areas have double the death rate of affluent ones, new figures from the ONS revealed. The most deprived areas registered 55.1 coronavirus-related deaths per 100,000 people, 118% times that in the least deprived areas where the rate was 25.3 per 100,000. London had the highest mortality rate, with the highest age-standardised mortality rates in the borough of Newham (144.3 deaths per 100,000), followed by Brent (141.5) and Hackney (127.4). Nicola Sturgeon adopted a cautious tone warning that it was “not safe” to lift lockdown restrictions for some time yet. This was in striking contrast with Boris Johnson’s optimistic tone yesterday that the UK is “past the peak”. The first minister of Scotland appeared concerned at the suggestion that the worst is over, later saying, “Progress is fragile and if we ease up it will be reversed. So we need to encourage maximum compliance with current restrictions”. Face coverings have a “weak but positive effect” in slowing the spread of the virus, the PM’s spokesman told the lobby briefing. Ministers have not yet made a final decision on whether the public will be advised to wear face coverings or not, but the advice suggests they have a weak but also positive effect in reducing transmission from asymptomatic people where physical distancing isn’t possible. The housing secretary Robert Jenrick also said this morning wearing one was a “personal choice”. Ryanair announced plans for 3,000 job cuts as a direct result of the pandemic. The airline said it expects to operate under 1% of its schedule between April and June, and expects the recovery of passenger demand and pricing to 2019 levels to take at least two years. That’s it from us on the UK side. Thanks to everybody who got in touch throughout the day with tips and suggestions, and to all of you for reading along. If you would like to continue following the Guardian’s coronavirus coverage, head over to our global live blog for the worldwide picture. The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said the government has gone well past its goal of 100,000 tests a day to combat coronavirus, but faced claims that the number had been artificially inflated. In his press briefing on Friday at 5pm, Hancock said in the 24 hours up to 9am on Friday there were 122,347 tests in the UK, a significant rise on Thursday’s figure of 81,611. “I knew that it was an audacious goal but we needed an audacious goal,” he said. “I can announce that we have met our goal.” Hancock immediately hailed the outcome as an “incredible achievement” and vindication for his strategy of focusing on a goal that had seemed well out of the government’s reach as recently as last week. But earlier on Friday, the Health Service Journal (HSJ) reported that the government was including home-testing kits sent out by post in the tally of tests, even if the recipient has not yet provided and returned their sample. It was claimed that, until recently, tests were only recorded in the daily count once they had been sent to a laboratory for analysis. The government, however, denied there had been a change. This is from the shadow health secretary The number of confirmed cases among prisons in England and Wales continues to rise, a daily update from the Ministry of Justice shows. As of 5pm on Thursday, there were 345 prisoners who had tested positive for Covid-19 across 73 prisons, a rise of 1% in 24 hours, while the number of infected prison staff rose 2% in the same period to 371 in 64 prisons. A Public Health England paper published earlier this week said there was cause for “cautious optimism” across the prison estate as deaths and cases were lower than expected. But the same paper warned that some of the measures currently in place would have to continue until April next year. Q. A Nursing Times survey indicates nurses are feeling more anxious at work and their mental health is suffering, what will be done about this in the long-term to retain nurses? Hancock says nurses have shown great bravery during the pandemic. He says increasing the number of nurses is an important part of the plan. Q. Have BAME nursing staff been put at greater risk? Powis says they recognise the disproportionate effect the virus is having on BAME staff. Work is being done to understand why this is, he says. Newton says the virus is present in different ways in different parts of the country, which are comprised of people from different backgrounds. The underlying risks need to be identified and understood, he says. Some ethnic groups have different risks of underlying conditions, he adds. PHE and universities are looking at this, and feeding back to NHS England, he says. Powis adds this data isn’t needed to provide support and specialist assistance is being offered. Local healthcare leaders are being told to do what’s necessary to protect BME workers. And that’s it, the press conference has ended. Q. The impact in Northern Ireland has been lower than in the rest of the UK. Is there any merit in eventually easing restrictions here at a different pace? Hancock says the virus has affected different regions differently but the fall has been basically the same throughout the country. Moving together was the right approach, he says. He says he sees the case that could be made for lifting restrictions at a different pace. Q. Would it be better for Stormont to work on an all-Ireland basis to fight the pandemic rather than following the UK lead? Hancock says the relationship with the Republic of Ireland is important but the relationship is intensive within the UK. Q. Can you reassure over-70s they will treated the same as the rest of the population when lockdown is over? Hancock says it was clear from the start that specific groups need to shield. Powis adds that the over-70s can be fit and healthy, not everybody at that age has a chronic health condition or underlying disease. A group of individuals, some of whom are in that age bracket, needed to shield because underlying conditions put them more at risk, he says. Everybody is being asked to stay at home so we’re all in the same boat in that sense, he adds. As the infection rate comes under control going forward, this will be under consideration. Q. Is late summer a realistic timescale for people to be able to make plans to meet up with friends and family or go on holiday? Hancock says it’s tempting to speculate on this but it’s still too early to say, we just don’t know, he says. The five tests are there partly to give people a sense of when we can make those next decisions, he says. We’ll only lift lockdown measures when it’s safe to do so, he says. As of today, it’s too soon to say. Q. A report in the HSJ says tests are now being counted once posted out rather than once the sample has been processed, is that true? Newton says there has been no change to the way tests are counted. With new ways of delivering tests, officials have given advice on how they should be counted, he says. The majority are counted in labs, but for any test which takes place outside the programme they’re counted when they leave the programme, he says. So tests that are mailed out or go out by satellite, have always been counted that way. That’s the way they are counted, have always been counted and were advised to count them by officials. Q. What’s your reaction to the report that you’re twice as likely to die from Covid-19 if you live in a deprived part of the country, what policy implications does that have? Hancock says this is something we’re worried about and looking at. It has a bigger impact on older people, men, people from BME backgrounds, people who are obese, and new evidence from the ONS suggests there is a correlation with deprivation – these are all being looked at, he says. Q. The daily testing figure is a massive increase in a short period of time. How many of those are home testing kits that were mailed out yesterday but haven’t actually been yet returned and analysed by labs? Newton says the NHS and PHE labs across the four nations have done 39,753 tests between them. A partnership with Roche undertook 13,723 tests. The tests undertaken by the new Lighthouse labs total 79,522, he says. These include drive-through, mobile units and research nurses for the ONS. There were 27,497 home kits delivered, and 12,782 delivered through the satellite process. Under the surveillance tests (antibody testing) there were 3,072 undertaken. That makes up the breakdown of today’s testing figure, he says. Q. How much weight do you put on a South Korean study that suggests you cannot get the virus a second time? Newton says the science on immunity is still emerging and not precise. You would never make a decision based on a single study, he says. These results would need to be replicated elsewhere, but it is surely promising and encouraging, he adds. Q. Was a Public Health England official wrong to suggest that children don’t seem able to transmit the disease? Powis says if a child is symptomatic, there’s no reason to think they won’t transmit like anyone else. The question is for children who don’t have any symptoms who get the virus, he says. How transmissible the virus is in these cases is a key question we’re still learning about, the evidence is still emerging, he says. Newton says this is his understanding also. Q. Can you ensure that health and care workers get priority so they can get tested? Hancock says yes, either through the NHS itself or through the employer route which will give them priority for getting a drive-through slot. Once we have contact tracing in place on a large-scale, we need to test them as soon as possible so they can isolate and not pass on the disease, he adds. This is a new priority for testing, once it’s up and running by the middle of the month, he says. They are taking questions from the media now. Q. How do you intend to further develop and extend the testing network? Hancock says very soon we should get the results of surveys to show how many people have the disease across the country. A new lab is coming on stream next week in Cambridge, he says. Capacity needs to focus on care homes to tackle the epidemic there, he says. Newton says the work of the new labs must integrate with the existing structures to help use the new capacity to maximum benefit, e.g. getting results back to GPs, he says. The rollout of home testing will be useful for contact tracing and rapid, he adds. Stuart from Redditch asks if the Nightingale hospitals will be used going forward to help reduce NHS waiting lists as we come through the pandemic? Hancock says the Nightingales were designed specifically for patients with Covid-19. Powis adds they were created to provide extra capacity for ventilated patients. They are designed in a particular way for a particular purpose, so they wouldn’t necessarily be appropriate for other uses, he says. They are also there as an insurance policy, he says. They are taking questions from members of the public now. Andrew from Leeds asks if there will be fines if people choose to keep their children off school once the lockdown is lifted and schools have reopened. How will the government make sure the public is confident it’s safe? Hancock says when it is safe to do so, the government will make recommendations on this. We’re not going to reopen schools if it isn’t safe, he says. This disease doesn’t appear to give children symptoms nearly as bad as adults, he says. Powis says the virus affects children much less than adults and the elderly. There have been rare reports about complications in children, which are being looked at, he says. The science is still evolving about transmission in children, but the key thing is the disease is not serious for the vast majority of younger people, he says. Hancock says the decision to close schools was down to the impact of schools on transmission, not on the safety of children, he says. Powis says most people are avoiding contact with vulnerable people, including 84% of adults have only left their for permitted reasons or not left their home. More people (45%) are working from home since the measures were introduced, he says. The number of tests have increased “dramatically” in the last few days, he says. The number of new cases as determined by positive tests have increased in recent days. This should be seen in the context of more testing, he says. Overall, the number is relatively stable, he says, which reflects the number of infections is falling. Hospital admissions have been falling, particularly in London. It’s moving down in other regions too more slowly, but overall the trend is downwards. The number of people in critical care is falling in the four nations, he says. Deaths in all settings is overall showing a downward trend. Prof Powis is going through the slides now. The transmission rate, the reproduction rate, the number of new infections is falling, keeping pressure off the NHS, he says. The five tests for adjusting the lockdown are: the NHS continues to have sufficient capacity sustained and consistent fall in daily deaths reliable data to show rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board PPE and other factors including testing must be in hand with supply to meet future demand a second peak must be avoided as it runs a risk of overwhelming the NHS Prof Newton is speaking now. The decision to enter lockdown was not linked to the lack of tests, he says. Access to limitless testing, even if we had had it, would not have made a difference, he says. The decision to enter lockdown would have been the same, and at the same time, he says. We can relax social distancing only when the five tests are met, he says. That means getting the infection rate right down. We now have a flexible and substantial testing capability in the UK, he says, to tell us how the virus is spreading across the country. The new NHS app is “making rapid progress”. He encourages people to sign up. Hancock says he knew the goal of 100,000 tests by the end of the month was “audacious”. He says the government has met its goal. The number of tests yesterday was 122,347, he says. The health secretary is speaking now. Hancock says he will talk about testing, after the daily statistics. Now that we’re past the peak, the restoration of NHS fertility services can begin, he says. 177,454 people have tested positive, an increase of 6,201 since yesterday. 15,111 people are currently in hospital, and 27,510 people have now died across all settings, an increase of 739. In a race to meet the government’s target of 100,000 coronavirus tests per day by this evening’s deadline, hospitals appear to have ramped up testing. A reader has been in touch to report a sudden surge in the number of samples arriving for analysis at the laboratory for Great Ormond Street children’s hospital. Demand for tests had been surprisingly low until this week, and staffing was more than halved as a consequence. On Sunday 18 April, the lab apparently received no samples at all. However, since Wednesday the situation has reversed, with technicians now processing as many as 600 samples a day. The Guardian understands that all patients and staff, whether they have Covid-19 symptoms or not, have been encouraged to take the test, along with the families and carers of patients. This follows guidance from NHS England asking hospitals to expand testing to all non-elective (serious and emergency) patients from Monday this week. Testing has apparently included children being shielded from infection on isolation wards. The procedure involves inserting a q-tip shaped swab into the nose, and another into the throat - an uncomfortable experience even for adults. A spokesperson for the hospital said: In line with national guidance we are testing all non-elective in-patients for Covid-19. Where possible we are taking the additional step of testing the parents and carers who accompany them. The health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, will front this afternoon’s daily government news briefing, which is due to begin shortly. He will be joined by Prof John Newton, co-ordinator of the UK coronavirus testing programme, and Prof Stephen Powis, the national medical director for NHS England. The Premier League’s 20 clubs outlined at a meeting on Friday their determination to complete the season amid the pandemic. Although no decisions were taken on the next steps, the participants are understood to have been pleased with the progress made. A lengthy meeting included plenty of discussion about logistics, including how to lock down grounds and create safe environments, the possibility of playing matches at neutral venues, and protocols around testing, including the regularity with which those should be done. In a statement the league said: The clubs reconfirmed their commitment to finishing the 2019-20 season, maintaining integrity of the competition and welcomed the government’s support. The league and clubs are considering the first tentative moves forward and will only return to training and playing with government guidance, under expert medical advice and after consultation with players and managers. NHS staff from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds may be given roles away from the frontline under plans to reduce their disproportionately high death rate from Covid-19. The Guardian revealed last week that minority groups were over-represented by as much as 27% in the overall Covid-19 death toll. Additionally, 63% of the first 106 health and social care staff known to have died from the virus were black or Asian, according to the Health Service Journal. In this explainer, my colleague Haroon Siddique looks at the figures and explains why BAME people may be more at risk. Care workers in Wales will each receive a £500 bonus to reflect their “value” during the pandemic, the first minister has announced. Mark Drakeford said the payments would be made to around 64,000 care home workers and domiciliary care workers who provide the “scaffolding” of services across the country. He told the Welsh government’s daily Covid-19 briefing on Friday: This payment is designed to provide some further recognition of the value we attach to everything they are doing. This group of people, usually women, often not well paid, are providing the invisible scaffolding of services which support both our NHS and our wider society. Without this small army of people, large numbers of others would not be able to continue to live independently at home, or receive everyday support with basic needs by living in a residential care home. Drakeford noted some of the social care workforce were among the lowest paid in Wales, and that the picture contrasted with the Welsh NHS where there are pay bands, and salaries meet or exceed the living wage. He also called on the UK government to waive tax and national insurance deductions from the one-off payment, on the basis the country was experiencing “exceptional circumstances”. Local authorities are expected to administer the payments but no date was given as to when they will be made. Some mid-afternoon joy. This is from Palmerston, the Foreign Office mouser More than two-thirds of London’s pavements are not wide enough to allow people to follow physical distancing advice to reduce the risk of Covid-19 transmission, according to new research. Only 36% of pavements in Greater London are at least 3 metres wide, allowing pedestrians to meet the government’s advice for people to stay at least 2 metres apart when outdoors, found researchers from University College London. There are also broad variations of the proportion of pavements wide enough to allow physical distancing in different London boroughs, according to the Streets research group, which includes academics from UCL’s Bartlett school of architecture. The City of London has the highest percentage (51%) of streets that meet the minimum requirement, while Hammersmith and Fulham, Wandsworth, Richmond upon Thames and Newham and Haringey all have the lowest (between 26-28%), according to their analysis. Dr Ashley Dhanani, a member of the project team and a research associate at the Bartlett’s Space Syntax Laboratory, said: While some may opt to walk in the road, this is not possible for people with pushchairs or with mobility impairments. Our research shows that there is an urgent need to reallocate street space in London so everyone can use streets safely. You can download a map of London that shows all the streets where there are at least six metres of non-road space here. These are the streets that have enough space on either side for pedestrians to stay 2 metres apart. NHS England has announced 352 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 20,483. The 352 patients were aged between 30 and 103 years old, and 18 of them (aged between 43 and 98 years old) had no known underlying health condition. Of the 352 new hospital deaths announced today by NHS England: - 70 occurred on 30 April - 148 occurred on 29 April - 39 occurred on 28 April The figures also show 70 of the new deaths took place between 1-27 April, while the remaining 25 deaths occurred in March, with the earliest new death taking place on 16 March. NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks earlier. This is because of the time it takes for deaths to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, for postmortem examinations to be processed and for data from the tests to be validated. Today’s figures published by NHS England show 8 April continues to have the highest number for the most hospital deaths occurring on a single day, with a current total of 863. Magdalen College, Oxford did their traditional May morning celebrations virtually this year. Researchers are to launch a new trial of a Japanese-manufactured drug they believe could be a “promising” treatment for Covid-19. A total of 450 hospital inpatients with mild to moderate symptoms of the disease will be recruited to take part in the study in the UK. The randomised control trial will see some receive favipiravir, an anti-viral drug produced by Fujifilm Toyama Chemicals in Japan. Other patients will received a combination treatment of hydroxychloroquine, zinc and azithromycin, while a third group will be given existing standard care for Covid-19. Chelsea and Westminster hospital and West Middlesex university hospital in London are participating in the trial, which also involves Imperial College and the Royal Brompton hospital. University Hospitals Leuven in Belgium aims to start a trial on up to 200 patients at a later date. Pallav Shah, a professor in respiratory medicine at Chelsea and Westminster hospital and the study’s chief investigator, said the study will target early cases of Covid-19 in the hope of finding a treatment which prevents patients progressing into intensive care, reduces the length of their hospital stay and limits their infectiousness. Patients with symptoms such as breathlessness and a fever will be approached to take part in the study before swab results even come back to ensure treatment can be given early. There have been 18 further deaths in Northern Ireland of patients who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total deaths in the region recorded so far by the Department of Health to 365. The award-winning Scottish orchestra Nevis Ensemble launched the Living Room Ensemble with the aim of putting together a series of performances by musicians and music lovers from across the country, performing at home and shown online. They asked people to submit videos of themselves playing instruments, banging pots and pans, singing along or dancing to the same piece of music. The finished product is now on YouTube, featuring 160 musicians and singers from 15 countries performing I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles) by The Proclaimers.

McDonald’s is to reopen a number of UK restaurants for delivery from 13 May after closing all of its sites due to the coronavirus lockdown. The locations of the 15 restaurants will be announced next week. The fast food chain has spent this week testing its operations behind closed doors in preparation to reopen sites, PA reports. Paul Pomroy, the chain’s boss for the UK and Ireland, said the tests were successful, after the company said it had incorporated feedback from staff after the tests and worked closely with the government and trade bodies regarding its reopening plans. All restaurants will be deep cleaned prior to reopening, with new safety measures such as perspex screens, floor markings and smaller teams. The chain will also serve a limited menu and will not be serving breakfast. Staff will also receive protective equipment, such as non-medical-grade face masks, and have their temperatures taken with “contactless thermometers” before shifts. Social distancing measures will be introduced for all delivery and service partners including Uber Eats and Just Eat. Pomroy added: Slowly, but safely, we will return to towns and cities across the UK and Ireland and thank you for your continued support as we work through this crisis.” The general public should turn to reusable face masks, not single-use surgical masks, if face coverings become part of the UK’s exit strategy for the Covid-19 pandemic, experts have said in a new report, revealing the move would save 128,000 tonnes of un-recyclable plastic waste. At a press conference yesterday, Boris Johnson said face masks could be useful as part of the UK’s exit strategy, suggesting they may help people have confidence in returning to work. However expert advice on the use of face masks among the general public has been mixed. It is understood the UK’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has advised the government there is weak evidence face masks can reduce the spread of infection – a stance similar to that of the World Health Organization and others who say there is little evidence they reduce the risk of a wearer becoming infected. Concerns have also been raised that any recommendation for the public to use face masks could lead to shortages of surgical masks among health and social care workers. But some scientists have said the public should wear masks as a part of the “precautionary principle”, adding these can be homemade since cloth masks are better than no covering in reducing the amount of droplets sprayed from people’s mouths. Now the Plastic Waste Innovation Hub at University College London has issued a report revealing that cloth masks would save vast quantities of plastic, and that washing them means they can be re-used. “If every person in the UK used one disposable surgical mask each day for a year, this would create over 128,000 tonnes of un-recyclable plastic waste (66,000 tonnes of contaminated waste and 57,000 tonnes of plastic packaging),” the report notes, adding that while contaminated waste from medical settings is collected and incinerated, no such facilities operate for the public which could result in public health problems. The report also reveals how the team carried out a careful analysis to explore the scenario with the lowest environmental impact, noting machine washing masks, used in rotation, is preferable to hand-washing, which is an inefficient way to clean them. “We’d recommend that people have four and that they use one a day, [then] they put that one straight in the washing basket and they wash it with their other [laundry],” said materials scientist Prof Mark Miodownik who led the work, adding that he welcomed the local manufacture of such cloth masks. In addition, the report contains advice on how a public campaign could be rolled out, noting it is important the public know how to put on and take off such masks, and that the use of masks doesn’t lead people to becoming complacent. “Single-use PPE undoubtedly has its place, particularly as an immediate measure to protect those at the greatest risk of infection,” the authors add. “However, any wide-scale public policies that are implemented during this crisis will have serious long-term ramifications, not only for public health but the health of the natural environment.” The government has changed the way it is counting the number of Covid-19 tests carried out, in a bid to hit its self-imposed 100,000 tests per day target, the Health Service Journal reports. Previously, a test would be counted once the sample had been processed in a lab, but this definition has been changed in the last few days, a senior source has told the HSJ. According to the source, the Department of Health and Social Care is now including tests that have been posted or delivered to people’s homes in its figures – which means tests that are sent to people are counted before the recipient has done their test and returned their sample to the lab. The HSJ understands that up to 50,000 of the tests that will be reported as having taken place on 30 April will actually represent the mailing of, or the agreeing to the mailing of, a home testing kit. You can read the full Health Service Journal story here. British Airways’ parent company has signed agreements for €1bn (£900m) of loans backed by the Spanish government, but the money cannot be used to help its UK airline, which is cutting up to 12,000 jobs, PA reports. IAG said the money could be used to help its Spanish carriers Iberia and Vueling mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic. There are “restrictions on the upstream of cash to the rest of the IAG companies”, the firm added. IAG has not requested a loan from the UK government. It announced this week that up to 12,000 jobs would be lost at BA, representing more than a quarter of its workforce. On Thursday it emerged that the airline may not resume operations at Gatwick, the UK’s second busiest airport. In a letter to staff, the BA chief executive, Alex Cruz, wrote: There is no government bailout standing by for BA. Pilots’ union Balpa has vowed it will fight to “save every pilot job at BA”. This is from the first minister of Scotland Speaking to the health and social care select committee on Friday, Claire Murdoch, national mental health director for NHS England, confirmed the NHS is planning for PTSD referrals for frontline staff. She said: We know it’s been a high stress environment. We’re planning mental health support right now. She said ensuring hospital teams offered support through good supervision, debriefs after shifts and making sure shift patterns allowed staff to recuperate would be crucial. “The military are very good at this,” she said. Murdoch added that trusts were investing more in occupational and mental health support for staff and that national helplines with third sector organisations, such as Samaritans, had been set up to support staff. Responding to MPs’ questions, Murdoch also said that there appeared to have been an overall drop of around 30-40% in referrals of members of the public to mental health services. But she added that there was no evidence currently for a spike in suicides or self-harm: We absolutely have not seen that. We’re pretty certain that levels of anxiety and distress will have increased for young people. Everyone’s more worried. Lots of people are sleeping less. The committee heard further evidence that cancer services were being disrupted, with urgent two-week referrals dropping by 63% last week, which Dame Cally Palmer, the national cancer director for NHS England, said was a concern: Early detection is vital for survival. She added that it was crucial that screening programmes, many of which have been paused, be restarted. There have been no national instructions on screening. It’s important to make sure that rescheduled screening take place, especially bowel cancer. Cancers are slow growing so 4-6 weeks should not affect survival but we need to get that turned back on. Lifetime Isas are effectively being unlocked temporarily for savers whose incomes have been hit by coronavirus. The rule changes will mean people can access their funds early without facing the usual hefty withdrawal penalty. The Treasury will legislate for a temporary reduction in the Lisa withdrawal charge to 20% between 6 March 2020 and 5 April 2021. This will generally mean account holders will only have to pay back any government bonus they have received, and they will not have to pay the additional withdrawal charge of 5%. A further 17 people have died after testing positive for Covid-19 in Wales, taking the total there to 925, Public Health Wales said. Another 160 cases were reported, bringing that total to 9,972. It is easy to see why it could be thrilling fiction for our times: it has a mysterious and fatal virus, an epidemiologist hero, a desperate search for a vaccine and murky political skulduggery. It also features a green monkey. But whether it is the moment for Stanley Johnson, the father of Boris Johnson, to be pushing his 40-year-old novel for a new release is another question. Nonetheless, British publishers have been invited to consider reissuing Johnson Sr’s 1982 thriller The Marburg Virus, the Guardian has learned. His agent is so convinced of his ability to effectively publicise a reissue that his pitch describes him as “a tireless self-promoter”. The Rugby Football League has been handed a £16m emergency loan from the government to help “protect the entire sport” throughout the pandemic. Many clubs within the professional game had expressed fears that without external financial support the sport faced a bleak future. The RFL chief executive, Ralph Rimmer, has warned clubs not to see the money as a “gravy train” and has made it clear the cash needs to last as long as possible to ensure clubs survive. He said: It’s not about dropping a lump sum in a club’s bank account and telling them to carry on as normal; we have to be far more meticulous. Needleworkers at Exeter Cathedral, the Company of Tapisers, have been making scrubs for the NHS and have completed 10 sets, with another 14 in progress, since beginning production two weeks ago. The group said the biggest challenge had been finding suitable fabric for volunteers to work on, with materials from as far away as Bradford being requested to meet specifications. The Company of Tapisers has been making vestments, kneelers, banners, cushions, and even rugs and ropes at the cathedral since 1933. At her daily briefing, Nicola Sturgeon was probed about overnight briefings suggesting that Boris Johnson’s optimistic tone yesterday was putting at risk her own message that progress remains very fragile and could easily be reversed if people relax their adherence to lockdown guidelines. The first minister said she was “not convinced there is a huge substantive difference” between what she and the prime minister were saying, adding that she was “choosing to use my own words”. Insisting that she did not want to diminish positive messages from the downward trend in hospital and intensive care admissions, she reiterated “it is too early to say that the light is not going to be extinguished”. She also warned: “If we are premature in these decisions and the virus runs away from us ... it will do even more damage to the economy.” Announcing the increase in testing capacity and eligibility, Sturgeon also underlined this “should not be an exercise in driving up the numbers”. Sturgeon warned the tests can be unpleasant and invasive, especially for frail older people, adding: “Yes, volumes are important ... but these must be clinically-driven decisions.” She said the focus on capacity and objectives of testing was more important than the numbers. McDonald’s has revealed it will reopen its first UK restaurants for delivery on 13 May after shutting sites due to the coronavirus lockdown. The fast-food giant said it would reopen 15 restaurants for delivery only, with the locations of these restaurants being announced next week, after it spent this week testing its operations behind closed doors in preparation to reopen sites. Two-thirds of Britons would feel uncomfortable attending large public gatherings, such as sports events or concerts, a new poll suggests, amid warnings the government’s “stay home” advice might have been “slightly too successful”. A recent survey for Ipsos Mori suggested that more than 60% of Britons would feel uncomfortable carrying out their usual activities – such as going to bars or restaurants, or using public transport – if the lockdown was eased. It suggests the public is nervous about a quick return to normality, with 61% saying they would feel uncomfortable using public transport or going to bars and restaurants. Young people are most at ease with going to bars and restaurants. Thirty-six per cent of 18-34-year olds would feel comfortable doing so, compared with only 22% of 55-75s. The polling comes as Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, of Cambridge University, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: It’s much harder to frighten to people to stay at home than it is to reassure them they can go out again. Maybe our whole campaign has been, if anything, slightly too successful. At this afternoon’s lobby briefing, Downing Street declined to contradict Donald Trump’s unsubstantiated claims that coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory. The PM’s spokesman said: There are clearly questions that need to be answered about the origin and spread of the virus, not least so we can ensure that we’re best prepared for a future global pandemic, this work will need to be done with our international partners. Budget airline Wizz Air will resume some flights from Luton airport on Friday with passengers and crew required to wear face masks. The Hungarian carrier will introduce the new hygiene measures when it reopens its base at the airport, including the wearing of face masks, physical distancing between passengers during boarding and an enhanced cleaning regime. Flights are due to operate to Budapest, Lisbon and Sofia on Friday. Other routes, such as Tenerife and Tel Aviv, will resume in the coming weeks, pending travel restrictions. UK lockdown restrictions prevent Britons from being allowed to travel to airports for a holiday. But people are able to fly for other reasons, such as to return home after being stranded overseas or if they are travelling for work. Customers are also being urged to use online services for checking in and making purchases such as additional bags to “reduce non-essential interaction at the airport”, and to use contactless payment methods if they buy anything while on flights. Here are the main takeaways from this afternoon’s Downing Street briefing: Ministers have not yet made a final decision on whether the public will be advised to use face coverings, the prime minister’s spokesman has insisted at the daily lobby briefing. Boris Johnson told yesterday’s press conference: I do think face masks will be useful, both for epidemiological reasons, and to give people the confidence that it is safe to go back to work. But his spokesman said no final decision had yet been taken: Ministers are still considering how we move forward with face coverings, in terms of the precise advice. The advice we have received, based on the science, shows a weak but also positive effect in reducing transmission from ... asymptomatic members of the public, where social distancing is not possible. And he suggested the prime minister was not referring to medical masks. We’re talking about face covering. We’re certainly not thinking about anything that might take PPE supplies away from the NHS, or care workers, or others. With the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, expected to host this evening’s daily press conference, the PM’s spokesman did not reveal whether the 100,000-a-day testing target had been met. But he said: The health secretary’s target has been very effective in driving up capacity in the system. Capacity is what’s really important.” He confirmed that 81,611 tests had taken place in the 24 hours to 9am on Thursday. The spokesman also didn’t rule out government support for ailing airlines: We’ve been clear we’re prepared to enter discussions with individual companies seeking bespoke support as a last resort. Although, he also pointed out the firms are eligible for many of the government’s other business support measures. A brand new edition of the popular Top Trumps card game, honouring Covid-19 key and essential workers, hits the shops on Monday. It hails key and essential workers working on the frontline during the pandemic, from doctors and nurses to less high profile sectors such as pest controllers, midwives and sea merchants. Politicians and journalists are also included. One of the four scoring sections in the new game is “unsung heroes”, where the partners of key workers come out top with a maximum 10 out of 10. Nicola Sturgeon has started her daily briefing by confirming 11,654 positive cases of coronavirus in Scotland, an increase of 301 from the day before. There are now 1,809 patients in hospital with suspected or confirmed Covid-19, an increase of 61 from the previous day; of these patients, 110 are in intensive care. The first minister also said that 2,659 patients who had the virus had left hospital since 5 March. In the last 24 hours there were a further 40 deaths registered of patients who had a positive test for the virus, taking that daily total to 1,515. Sturgeon also set out a chunk of detail on testing, as promised. Active lab capacity in NHS Scotland is now at 4,350 tests a week, and added to the UK’s Lighthouse lab in Glasgow this means that the country now has the capacity for 8,350 tests a day. In terms of actual tests carried out, a total of 4,661 were carried out yesterday, a combination of 2,537 NHS tests and 2,124 from the UK government’s regional drive-through centres. She also announced a significant expansion in eligibility for testing – all residents and staff in care homes with cases will now be tested. There will also be sample testing in other care homes, access to drive-through centres for the over-65s and those few workers who have to leave home for work but aren’t already eligible. Yesterday we reported that the Children’s Commissioner Scotland and a coalition of charities had written to supermarket chief executives urging them to stop the barring and abuse of single parents shopping for essentials with their children. As of this morning, three have replied to the letter. Marks and Spencer was first off the mark, saying they had given “clear guidance...that it may be necessary for parents to bring their children shopping with them and under no circumstances should a family be turned away”. Co-op acknowledged the points made and gave assurances for the future, while ScotMid insisted that children would not be restricted in stores. A head of procurement for the NHS has set up a business to profit from the private sale of huge quantities of personal protective equipment in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, an undercover investigation by the Guardian can reveal. David Singleton, 42, a senior NHS official in London who has been working at the capital’s Covid-19 Nightingale hospital, launched the business two weeks ago to trade in visors, masks and gowns. Several readers have been in touch about what the R number, or effective reproduction number, of coronavirus means. This piece from our science correspondent Hannah Devlin provides a very handy explanation. In a nutshell, it’s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. Heathrow airport has warned that it may soon follow British Airways in announcing mass redundancies unless the government restores confidence by planning for how flying could restart. The chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said physical distancing measures could not work in airports, and common international standards for health controls were needed, such as temperature screening at the entrances to airports and the wearing of face masks throughout the process to ensure a low risk of transmission. Passenger numbers at the UK’s largest airport fell by 97% in April, and Holland-Kaye urged the government to take a lead in developing a global agreement for new measures. He said while forward bookings implied there was still “massive demand for travel”, it was vital to plan ahead. Full story here: One of the UK’s largest providers of care homes, which has lost more than 300 residents to Covid-19, has responded angrily to Boris Johnson’s claim the pandemic is on a downward slope, saying this is not true in care homes and lambasting the newly announced testing regime as “completely shambolic”. MHA, which has 222 facilities, said the prime minister was being “at best disingenuous” when he told the Downing Street press briefing the UK had come through the peak and there was sunlight ahead. Sam Monaghan, the chief executive of the network, said: We are now 43 days in from lockdown, yet still our residents and staff have not received the enhanced level of protection that they need. The government will be held to account for this. Confirmed or suspected coronavirus deaths in care homes have been running at around 2,400 a week, according to official figures published on Tuesday. Monaghan said that despite nursing dementia homes being by far the worst hit by the virus “no consideration has been given to prioritising tests for those settings, nor the suitability of administering tests to our residents”. This cannot surely be beyond the ability of our policymakers, scientists and government. We said weeks ago that we were being treated as the poor relations to the NHS and the situation, despite our protestations, has not improved. On Tuesday, the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, announced the rollout of testing of all residents and staff in care homes in England, regardless of whether they are showing symptoms, insisting “the spread of the virus though care homes is absolutely a top priority”. But Monaghan said that while the long-called-for policy was laudable, “in practice it remains completely shambolic, with many staff and residents unable to secure tests, inconsistencies between the nations, leaving homes unable to effectively control the virus”. We cannot and will not accept assumptions that higher rates of death in care homes is somehow inevitable. With the right support, it isn’t. Peers have announced plans to form a Covid-19 committee to scrutinise the government’s response to the pandemic. A report by the Lords liaison committee recommended the new Covid-19 committee should undertake “cross-cutting” scrutiny of the government’s response, developing understanding of the lessons learned and how they can be applied in the future. The recommendation to establish the new committee will be put to a motion for agreement in the House of Lords. Members will then be appointed to the committee in the coming weeks. Lord McFall of Alcluith, the senior deputy speaker of the House of Lords, said: This is the first time either house has sought to establish a new committee dedicated to the Covid-19 emergency and the government’s response to it. Two key strengths of Lords committees are their cross-cutting nature, they are thematic in approach rather than set up to shadow government departments, and the real world experience our members can bring to them. These strengths will be much in evidence in the new Covid-19 committee which will be made up of experts across a whole range of relevant professional backgrounds and be free to consider all the aspects and impact of the current crisis, including on the economy, education and the social bonds between generations. I firmly believe the new committee will have a key role to play in ensuring we learn the right lessons from the crisis and understand to the fullest extent its effects upon our society, economy and way of life. Downing Street said the prime minister Boris Johnson chaired the daily Covid-19 meeting on Friday. Number 10 said the the government would announce that the Rugby Football League will receive a £16m cash injection “to safeguard the immediate future of clubs in England”. A spokesman said: The emergency loan will help the sport deal with the extreme financial impact of the coronavirus outbreak while the season remains suspended, due to social distancing measures. High-risk pregnancies may be missed during the coronavirus pandemic because expectant mothers are too scared to pick up the phone to their midwife, according to Gill Walton, the chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives (RCM). Anxiety in the pregnant population is becoming more pronounced during the Covid-19 outbreak, a committee was told, with an increase in referrals to perinatal mental health services. Walton told MPs she was concerned this may be a factor which could lead to a potential rise in stillbirths and neonatal deaths. She told the Commons health and social care committee messaging is key in ensuring women come forward if they need help: Some of that is related to the fear of the pregnant population and presenting to maternity services during the pandemic, and that fear then prevents them even sometimes just picking up the phone to say they may be concerned. I believe that maternity services have tried their very best to try and keep providing as much of a normal service as possible. I do think it’s really important to be getting that message out that maternity services are still open and that women should come forward so that we can keep them and their babies as well as possible. RCM members have reported many patients becoming more anxious during the pandemic, she added, emphasising the importance of directing pregnant women to call their midwives with mental health concerns in the first instance. Walton also said she was concerned about the apparent disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on BAME staff and pregnant women. She said expectant mothers from BAME backgrounds should be treated “as more vulnerable than the general population and midwives are aware of that”. Home births have faced the biggest impact from the pandemic, she said, with services disrupted due to reasons including staffing issues and paramedic ambulance capacity. She said returning to home births would require risk assessments, the return of staffing and testing of women in the community who want to have a baby at home. Olivia Strong, founder of the Run for Heroes 5km Challenge, which has raised £5m for NHS charities, has received the prime minister’s daily Point of Light award. In a personal letter to Olivia, Boris Johnson wrote: As we persevere with the restrictions to stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives, I have been inspired by the ingenuity of your Run for Heroes 5km Challenge. Using your daily lockdown exercise to run 5K, donate 5 and nominate 5 people, you have raised more than 5 million to support the extraordinary work of our true heroes - the men and women of our unique NHS. With over a million participants from more than 20 countries, you have roused a global movement that has collectively run the entire distance to the moon and back! Thank you for your brilliant initiative and for all that you have done to support our wonderful NHS. Strong said: It’s an absolute pleasure and delight to accept this award on behalf of the whole Run For Heroes community. Not only the amazing people who have helped with the campaign (India, Alice and my family), but everyone who has continued to run, donate and nominate! It’s been so wonderful to see people coming together for such a worthwhile cause! Good morning!

Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Public health campaigners are calling on the Scottish government to keep focus on managing Scotland’s problematic relationship with alcohol, on the second anniversary of the introduction of minimum unit pricing. Minimum unit pricing (MUP) came into force in Scotland on 1 May 2018, in an attempt to cut the country’s higher-than average alcohol consumption and high death rates from alcohol-related diseases, and bars retailers from selling alcoholic drinks, including beers, wines, spirits and ciders, at less than 50p per unit of alcohol. Alison Douglas, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, said, “The initial results from the evaluation of minimum unit pricing are hugely encouraging as studies have found a significant decrease in consumption in the first year compared to England and Wales. However, the recent reports of growing alcohol sales and our own research showing that one million of us in Scotland are drinking more under lockdown, highlight the ongoing issue we still have with alcohol in this country. It remains to be seen what impact social distancing will have and what new challenges it will throw up. But it is unlikely that Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with alcohol will be changed for the better.” Discussions are currently taking place in the Scottish government about a possible relaxation of alcohol licensing restrictions during the lockdown, as elderly shoppers and others take advantage of early supermarket opening. The number of mortgages being approved to home buyers nosedived to a seven-year low in March. The sharp deterioration happened amid signs that households are running a “tight ship” by making large repayments on other types of borrowing such as credit cards. Figures from the Bank of England show that 56,161 mortgages were approved for house purchase in March. This was a drop-off of nearly a quarter (24%) compared with the previous month, and the lowest monthly total since 54,341 approvals were recorded in March 2013. The pause button has been pushed on the housing market as people and businesses adhere to lockdown measures imposed on March 23 to limit the spread of coronavirus. Dame Cally Palmer, national cancer director for NHS England, said chemotherapy treatments were running at 70% of normal levels but two-week referrals were down by 62%. She told MPs at the health and social care committee: “Broadly, chemotherapy appointments are running at about 70% of normal levels and the reason for that, and we think we can set them back very quickly because, of course, is they use different facilities and workforce broadly from surgery and the other resources required to respond to Covid-19.” She added: “We had just under 15,000 people booked for an appointment but that is a 62% reduction and clearly it’s very important we address that because early detection is vital for increased survival.” When asked if that meant up to two-thirds of cancers were being missed, Dame Cally replied: “I don’t think that’s the case because the service has roughly an 8% conversion rate for urgent referrals. “It’s really important to state that urgent referrals and urgent cancer treatments are continuing – obviously we need to tailor that to patients’ individual risk but I think it would be wrong to make a mathematical calculation on that basis. “It’s very important that we get people coming forward but I think to translate that into missed diagnosis and poor survival would not be a responsible position at this point.” Flights between Britain and Northern Ireland will continue to operate through £5.7m of taxpayer funding, the transport secretary Grant Shapps has announced. The package is being funded by the UK government and the Northern Ireland executive to ensure airports and airlines do not axe “lifeline services” because of the collapse in demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Aer Lingus and Loganair will be subsidised to maintain London flights to and from Belfast City airport and City of Derry airport respectively. The Northern Irish airports involved will also be given funding to provide ground services for the flights. The Belfast-London route “would be at risk without financial assistance given low passenger numbers”, the Department for Transport stated. Shapps said: “Maintaining air links between Great Britain and Northern Ireland is vital. “We must ensure that critical workers can continue to fly over the Irish Sea and today’s investment in these lifeline services guarantees that.” When asked about the provision of mental health care for pregnant women, Walton said members of the Royal College of Midwives had reported many patients had become more anxious during the pandemic. She said: “A lot of women get anxious during pregnancy anyway and I think the pathways for advice and referrals have got better over recent years. “During the pandemic, women have become even more anxious because pregnant women are a vulnerable group, so there has been an increase in referrals to perinatal mental health services, we know that. “What we are trying to do is bring some of that support and care back to the midwife. “Every woman has a midwife, midwives have training in supporting women who have anxiety and apprehension, and the ability to refer onwards if they believe a wider mental health team would be of assistance.” Walton emphasised the importance of directing pregnant women to call their midwives with mental health concerns in the first instance. The chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives has told MPs she is concerned high-risk pregnancies may be missed due to the pandemic, leading to a potential rise in stillbirths and neonatal deaths. Addressing the health and social care committee, Gill Walton said: “Some of that is related to the fear of the pregnant population and presenting to maternity services during the pandemic, and that fear then prevents them even sometimes just picking up the phone to say they may be concerned. “I believe that maternity services have tried their very best to try and keep providing as much of a normal service as possible. “I do think it’s really important to be getting that message out that maternity services are still open and that women should come forward so that we can keep them and their babies as well as possible.” Walton said that follow-ups on women who miss scans and appointments has been enhanced. She added: “One of the positives from the pandemic is the use of technology, so there has been more virtual contact and follow-up with women through midwives and maternity services than before.” Residents in deprived areas have experienced double the death rates of those in affluent areas, new figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal. Of the 20,283 Covid-19 registered deaths in England and Wales to 17 April an overwhelming proportion of fatalities were of people from the poorest areas. The most deprived area had 55.1 deaths per 100,000 people, more than double (118%) that in the least deprived areas, where the rate was 25.3 deaths. London had the highest mortality rate, with 85.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The highest age-standardised mortality rate was in the London borough of Newham, with 144.3 deaths per 100,000 population, followed by Brent, with 141.5 deaths per 100,000 population, and Hackney, 127.4 deaths per 100,000 population. Manufacturing in the UK collapsed in April, hitting levels lower than during the height of the 2008 financial crisis, according to the latest IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers’ Index. The index recorded a score of 32.6 for February – anything above 50 is seen as growth – hitting the lowest level since the survey began 28 years ago, in the first significant sign of the impact of Covid-19 on the economy. Hello everyone, please do get in touch this morning to share your thoughts, comments and news tips with me while I run the live blog. Thanks. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com An online festival is being organised by the UK’s specialist cheese community to urge the public to support small cheesemakers during the Covid-19 lockdown. The event will take place on the early May bank holiday and is being organised by the Specialist Cheesemakers Association (SCA), the Academy of Cheese, the Guild of Fine Food and cheese writer Patrick McGuigan. It invites cheese lovers to stock up on artisan cheese in the lead-up to the festival to raise awareness of the crisis that threatens to wipe out the previously thriving speciality cheese industry. The festival will be free and educational, organisers said. Tracey Colley, director of the Academy of Cheese, commented: “We are absolutely thrilled to see how many experts from across our industry have wanted to take part in the British Cheese Weekender. From cheesemakers to cheese distributors we now have a multitude of virtual cheese events for everyone to join in with. The Academy of Cheese community of over 2,000 members are busy planning where to buy cheese for the weekend and with so many fantastic artisan cheeses now available for direct delivery they are very excited”. David Nabarro, the World Health Organization’s special envoy on Covid-19, said it would be “perfectly reasonable” for the UK to start easing the lockdown before a full contact tracing system was up and running. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “Every government is having to make a choice and I understand that the contact tracing process is now well advanced and so that’s a reasonable time to be thinking through how lockdown can be eased, and it won’t be eased all at once, it will be eased bit by bit.” He added: “You don’t need to have 100% contact tracing in order to get the R number down. The contact tracing is an absolutely essential part of reducing transmission, and getting that capacity as widely spread as possible is key to getting the transmission as low as you can. “But you certainly can release the lockdown while you’re building up the case-finding and contact-tracing capacity - that’s what most other countries are doing.” Leaders of the UK town predicted to suffer the biggest economic hit from the coronavirus pandemic have issued an urgent plea for help from the government. More than 50% of jobs in Crawley are at risk of being lost or furloughed, according to a recent report. There are fears that the West Sussex town, located close to Gatwick airport, could experience an “employment catastrophe” as the economy “most affected” by the Covid-19 lockdown. The leader of the borough council and the town’s MP have called on the government to take rapid action and “ensure that Crawley’s amazing economic success, built up over many decades, is not lost in a matter of weeks”. The letter states: “It is quite clear that the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the national economy and indeed the world economy is unprecedented. “However, due to the business sectors located within the town, and the proportion of local jobs and economic output from these sectors, Crawley is undeniably being hit far harder than any other part of the United Kingdom.” Heathrow’s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, has described social distancing at airports as “impossible”. He told the PA Media agency: “Social distancing does not work in any form of public transport, let alone aviation. “The constraint is not about how many people you can fit on a plane, it will be how many people you can get through an airport safely. “If you’ve ever been on holiday from Gatwick, you cannot imagine going through there and socially distancing in the summer. “It’s just physically impossible to socially distance with any volume of passengers in an airport. The same applies with trains and tube stations. “So we need a better solution, which means that in a few months’ time, when the disease is under control and with a low risk of infection, we can make it as low risk as possible for people to fly.” After the striking difference in tone yesterday between Boris Johnson’s “past the peak” optimism and Nicola Sturgeon’s far more cautious warnings that it is “not safe” to lift lockdown restrictions for some time yet, there are reports this morning of concerns within the Scottish government that Johnson risks jeopardising progress by suggesting that the worst is over. Scottish government sources have likewise raised doubt about an apparent shift in UK strategy after the wording of one of the five tests was tweaked to remove references to a second peak. While the UK government has denied that this was a meaningful change, Sturgeon said at her press conference yesterday that she was still trying to ascertain whether it was a significant shift, and that it was not one she agreed with, stating that while not overwhelming the NHS was a critical and necessary objective, “I don’t think it is a sufficient objective”. Expect more questions on this at the first minister’s briefing this lunchtime, when she has also promised to give a “substantial” update on testing in Scotland. Coronavirus has killed tens of thousands of people in the UK. Each death is a person who was loved by someone. Guardian reporter Aamna Mohdin is writing tributes for those who died during the pandemic. Please email her (aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com) if you want to share your memories of someone who has passed away. Housing secretary Robert Jenrick said: It’s a personal choice, if you have a face mask it’s your choice whether you want to use them and if you walk around some of our towns and cities today you are seeing more people using them than ever before. The advice today is that the difference made by a face covering is quite modest - it doesn’t make a huge difference but it does make some. So it’s your choice. More than 13 million people have already been unable to pay, or expect to be unable to pay, at least one bill because of the coronavirus outbreak, according to research. Of these, almost 11 million have missed or expect to miss a bill that would leave them vulnerable to severe consequences – including eviction, bailiff enforcement or disconnection – when Covid-19 financial protections end. Some sectors, including energy, water and mortgages, have established frameworks for helping people out of debt in a sustainable way. Others, including the private rented sector and local authorities, do not. According to its research, commissioned by Citizen’s Advice and conducted by Opinium among 2,016 nationally representative UK adults, those most at risk of severe consequences include 2.6 million private renters who have missed a rent payment already or expect to do so owing to coronavirus.

Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com This morning the Commons Health Committee will hear evidence on core NHS and care services. There will later be a World Health Organisation briefing on Covid-19 and the usual 5pm (GMT) Downing Street press conference. Briefing in Wales and Scotland expected are expected at 12.30 pm (GMT). Britain has passed the peak of coronavirus infections, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday. He said that the government will set out a “road map” for easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions next week. Coronavirus fatalities among black and minority ethnic (BAME) groups are disproportionately high – and some are also bearing the economic brunt of the lockdown, a study has found. Stark analysis by the Institute of Fiscal Studies found that deaths of people from a black Caribbean background were 1.7 times higher than for white Britons. NHS England figures published last week showed that hospital deaths per 100,000 among British people of a black Caribbean background were three times the equivalent number among the majority white British population. However, unlike previous analysis, the IFS research, published on Friday, strips out the role of age, gender and geography and shows that they do not explain the disparities. Victims of domestic abuse will be able to seek help in Boots pharmacies in a bid to make it easier for them to access support during the coronavirus lockdown. The coronavirus crisis has sparked a huge increase in people using food banks for essential supplies, according to charities. The Trussell Trust, the UK’s biggest food bank network, said it experienced its busiest ever period after lockdown was announced on 23 March, when it issued 50,000 food parcels in the space of a week, almost double its usual volume. Care homes will be the “epicentres of transmission” for coronavirus spreading back into society, according to a report quoting a senior NHS England director. Disabled people are struggling to get supermarket delivery slots and are being judged or challenged when they go out to buy food, according to a charity. The government is being urged to deliver pay rises and better conditions for the millions of people who are working through the Covid-19 crisis. Britain’s manufacturers have suffered a “collapse” in demand because of the impact of the global lockdown amid warnings that conditions are unlikely to return to anywhere near normal for some time, a new survey suggests. Ryanair has said it expects up to 3,000 jobs to be lost as part of a restructuring of the airline. Jenrick later told BBC Breakfast that the number of tests carried out were “just a stepping stone” to more and that the foundations were in place for a strong national testing network. “We’ve got labs across the country producing the equipment at pace and we’re beginning to test essential workers,” he said, adding that local government workers could now also apply for tests. • The total number of coronavirus deaths across the world has reached at least 232,817, according to Johns Hopkins University, which has tracked the spread of the virus during the pandemic. The US has the highest number of deaths with at least 63,763, followed by Italy with 27,967. • Germany is to reopen museums, galleries, zoos and playgrounds, and allow religious services to resume, in measures agreed by the chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the leaders of 16 federal states. This will take place under strict conditions. • Brazil reported a record 7,218 confirmed new cases of coronavirus, raising the total to 85,380. The death toll rose by 435 to 5,901, the health ministry said. There has been outrage in the country over the approach of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has previously attacked what he termed the “hysteria” over Covid-19. • The Russian prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, has said he has been diagnosed with coronavirus and will self-isolate from the government, in the country’s highest-profile case of the disease yet. Housing secretary Robert Jenrick said he thought government testing for coronavirus will have been a “success” even if the target of 100,000 tests is not met later today. “I think we will either have met it or be very close, and in that sense the target will have succeeded because it will have galvanised people across government, in the private sector and across the country,” he told Sky News on Friday. “This in itself is just a stepping stone, we need to go beyond 100,000, but we have seen now a very substantial increase in testing in quite a short period of time, so in that sense it’s been a success, but there’s more to be done.” He said that the country now needed to “build some head room” between the rate of infection (R) and one before lockdown measures could be eased. “The R [value] is still below one but we need to build some head room, there isn’t an exact figure as to where the R is - it’s somewhere, the chief medical officer tells us, between 0.6 and 0.9,” he said. “We want to bring R down further than it is today and that matters so that the NHS has sufficient capacity, so that when we do start to ease the lockdown, there’s some space, some room, for manoeuvre.” He added that the government approach was a “cautious easing over time” so that such headroom for the NHS could be maintained and protected. The statistician Sir David John Spiegelhalter warned against taking a “Eurovision approach” and making “naive comparisons” between the UK’s and other countries’ Covid-19 deaths. Speaking to the BBC’s Today programme, the Cambridge University professor said: I think it’s too early to tell our exact place in the league table. My article was arguing against this almost Eurovision approach of trying to say who’s top, who’s second and so on. It’s just not appropriate to do at all. There are so many variabilities about how people record Covid deaths - even what the correct metric is for measuring the impact of the epidemic - that to start saying we’re going to be worse or whatever is completely inappropriate.” On the government’s advice, Spiegelhalter said: “It’s much harder to frighten to people to stay at home than it is to reassure them they can go out again. Maybe our whole campaign has been, if anything, slightly too successful. Jeremy Hunt said that the coronavirus outbreak has showed the importance of the social care sector and the need for funding. Speaking on the BBC Today programme and, the chair of the health and social care select committee said: If there is one thing this terrible crisis has brought home to us it is importance of the social care sector … and the crucial work done by those who care for them. They put lives at risk as NHS workers do, and often for low pay. So I will be asking for proper settlement for the social care sector... and the government will want to do that. He said that testing in the community, as has been done in South Korea, will be key. “That is what they did in South Korea so they could stop the virus in its track. It’s locking down the people who might have the virus but not locking down the whole economy.” Hunt said that contract tracing would need to be done through a combined method of technology and also people going door to door. He added that there would be a time when the government would need to change its messaging from “stay at home” to encourage people back out, but to date their approach has worked. Ryanair announced the planned job cuts as it revealed it expects to operate under 1% of its schedule between April and June. It said in a statement: As a direct result of the unprecedented Covid-19 crisis, the grounding of all flights from mid-March until at least July, and the distorted state aid landscape in Europe, Ryanair now expects the recovery of passenger demand and pricing (to 2019 levels) will take at least two years, until summer 2022 at the earliest. The Ryanair Airlines will shortly notify their trade unions about its restructuring and job loss programme, which will commence from July 2020. These plans will be subject to consultation but will affect all Ryanair Airlines and may result in the loss of up to 3,000 mainly pilot and cabin crew jobs, unpaid leave and pay cuts of up to 20%, and the closure of a number of aircraft bases across Europe until traffic recovers. Job cuts and pay cuts will also be extended to head office and back office teams. Group CEO Michael O’Leary, whose pay was cut by 50% for April and May, has now agreed to extend this 50% pay cut for the remainder of the financial year to March 2021. Morning everyone and welcome to the Guardian’s UK live feed, keeping you up to date on all the latest developments around the coronavirus outbreak. As ever, please do get in touch while I work this morning. It’s always really useful to get any insight and news tips from readers. I will try to respond to as many of you as I can. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com I’ll begin with a little brightness today, and share an image I was sent yesterday after my shift ended of a rainbow over London. Welsh first minister Mark Drakeford has said he does not think certain parts of the UK should come out of lockdown before others. Speaking to the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the Labour politician said: I agree with the prime minister, I am in favour of a four-nation approach. We went into lockdown together on the same terms, on the same day. I’d like to see us come out of lockdown on the same basis. But we will use the powers we have to fine-tune the arrangements to make them right for Wales.” He added: As we move to open up things again, we will be careful and cautious, we will have to take people with us. Our efforts over the last week have been directed at working with our trade unions, our local authorities and other stakeholders because you can open up anything you like, but if people don’t think it’s safe to take up what is now available to them, they won’t come.”
127	Dave Kitson’s bid to become chief executive of the Professional Footballers’ Association has received a blow after the chairman of Kick It Out questioned his anti-racism credentials and three black players attacked the former Reading striker’s controversial comments about Raheem Sterling. Kitson launched his campaign to replace Gordon Taylor as the head of the PFA this week but he faces an uphill battle to win the support of black players, who have not forgotten how he reacted to a Chelsea supporter racially abusing Sterling in December 2018 by saying that the Manchester City forward’s social media posts had “antagonised” people. The 40-year-old was accused of excusing racism after suggesting Sterling had made himself a target during an appearance on TalkSport and his bid to replace Taylor has been met with an angry response from current and former professionals. Jobi McAnuff said Kitson’s remarks about Sterling had crossed a line and the Leyton Orient captain’s views were backed up by Marvin Sordell, the former Bolton striker, and Marcus Bean, the former Brentford and Wycombe midfielder. Sanjay Bhandari, the head of Kick It Out, football’s anti-discrimination charity, said: “The PFA are valued partners of Kick It Out. Anyone who has aspirations to lead the PFA in the future must have in mind the best interests of all players. Given Dave Kitson’s previous remarks, I would be deeply concerned about his ability to represent black players. He needs to win their confidence and I doubt he can do that.” At the time Kitson said Sterling’s posts were “no excuse whatsoever for racially abusing somebody, but you sow a seed amongst people who are not racist, not to like that particular person, because they don’t want to see that in their faces every day”. When contacted by the Guardian about the reaction to his PFA bid he said: “My objective is to ensure that the policies of the union reflect the needs and aspirations of all its members. Very importantly, that must include a much more effective anti-racism policy.” McAnuff, who spent a season in the Premier League with Reading, said: “He’s had his say on certain matters, particularly on Raheem Sterling, and that certainly was something that I objected to in the most severe manner. He’s almost saying he brought on any racist abuse himself. That is inexcusable. Even if Raheem Sterling had been posting pictures of his lifestyle, that gives nobody a right to racially abuse somebody. “The fact he could suggest that was a reason is completely unacceptable. I’ve gone on Dave Kitson’s Instagram and seen some of the pictures he’s put on, which would be similar to what he was saying about Raheem showing off. He has pictures with a gun, he has pictures with flash cars after his retirement. It was massively hypocritical.” McAnuff insisted an apology would not suffice for him. “A line has been crossed,” he said. “I can’t see that many other players in my position would accept an apology and be happy to move on.” Sordell, who retired last year, was asked whether he thought Kitson is unfit to lead the union. “Absolutely,” he said. “The PFA represents players. They are where players go for protection. Whether that’s happened or not in the past or currently is a different debate. If we look forward to the future and to somebody who makes excuses for racism and doesn’t protect the player, how can we look to those people for protection in the future. “What he said is so wrong and it’s that mentality that stops us progressing. What he said isn’t necessarily racist but it allows room for racism to grow. It allows people to think saying certain things is OK. It isn’t.” Bean, who also retired last year, said: “It’s audacity. Having someone like that in charge would leave a sour taste in my mouth. I would vehemently protest it before he was in charge. He wouldn’t receive my vote and I’d be actively trying to rectify the situation if he was in charge. People aren’t happy. Not just players but also black agents I speak to and other staff in the game. People are asking how this can be representative of us.”
128	The government must prioritise health funding for the most deprived regions in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, politicians and public health experts have demanded, after new data analysis revealed the devastating scale of the death toll in the poorest parts of England and Wales. In findings one expert said highlighted the fact that Covid-19 “is not a leveller” as politicians have repeatedly claimed, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that those living in the poorest parts of England and Wales were dying at twice the rate of those in the richest areas. With 55.1 deaths per 100,000 people in the most deprived places compared with 25.3 in the least deprived, the King’s Fund health thinktank demanded the government focus new resources to reverse health inequalities as the crisis eases. The findings came as another 739 people died across the UK, bringing the total to 27,510. They echo last week’s report from the Guardian that members of ethnic minority groups were particularly badly affected by the virus, with those from BAME backgrounds overrepresented in the toll by 27%. Responding to the analysis at the government’s briefing on Friday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, acknowledged the issue, saying: “This is something we are worried about and looking at.” He added, however, that the findings should be seen in the context of disproportionate deaths among men, older people, minorities and other subgroups. “We’re looking at it in the context of all of the different ways that this disease seems to have a different impact,” he said. Critics said impact of austerity in the poorest communities was behind the new data. Steve Rotheram, the Labour mayor for the Liverpool city region argued that deprivation must be a factor in how spending is allocated to deal with costs incurred during the crisis.. Liverpool has one of the highest Covid-19 death rates outside London, with 303 deaths, amounting to 81.8 deaths per 100,000 people, and is the local authority to have suffered the biggest cuts to its budget since 2010. The city region’s councils are already warning of a £137m funding gap between the money they have spent dealing with coronavirus and the funds pledged to them by government, said Rotherham. He called for a change in the methodology of the Treasury’s “green book”, which guides government spending, in order to prioritise the most deprived areas – rather than the per capita approach it currently takes. “Deprivation should be factored into Treasury-book methodology across the board but specifically in relation to this. Local authorities were promised ‘whatever it takes’. The first allocation of fund was given on a needs basis but the second wasn’t,” he said. Maggi Morris, a health consultant and former head of public health in Central Lancashire, said the economic policies of Conservative-led governments of the last decade had done nothing to actually help reduce health inequalities. “In fact, they have exacerbated them,” she said. The government must reverse benefit changes, she said, particularly cuts to housing allowance and the bedroom tax, which had forced more people to live in cramped accommodation where disease spreads more easily. The ONS data exposed the lie that Coronavirus attacks all equally, she said. “It is not a leveller. More people who are at social economic disadvantage will not only get ill but get iller and will die in numbers greater than the privileged. This disease knows where to find the weakest links.” Along with the King’s Fund, she called for a national strategy to tackle health inequality. “There has been no national strategy because it doesn’t want to acknowledge that disparities exist,” she said. London’s poorest boroughs have the highest Covid-19 death rates in led by England and Wales, led by Newham, with 144.3 deaths per 100,000 population, followed by Brent with 141.5 and 127.4 in Hackney. Other local authorities including Hertsmere, Salford, Watford, Luton, Sandwell and Slough also had rates above 65 deaths per 100,000 people. In Middlesbrough, where 89 people have died of Coronavirus – which amounts to 79 deaths per 100,000 – male life expectancy is just 75.3, compared with almost 84 in the wealthy London borough of Westminster. Andy McDonald, the local Labour MP, said: “The health profile of Middlesbrough is awful and we know what that’s about. It’s about poverty and inequality and you can’t get away from that.” The ONS data is age-standardised, which means the age profile of people living in each area has been accounted for. But David Buck, the former deputy director for health inequalities at the department of health and now a policy advisor at the King’s Fund, said he suspected further data analysis would show that younger people were dying from Covid-19 in the poorest areas. “We know that the more deprived your situation the more likely you are to have co-morbidities such as diabetes. We know that those multiple, long term conditions are much more prevalent the poorer you are but also in a younger age group … I haven’t looked at the data but that would be my bet,” said Buck. The government should reintroduce targets to reduce inequality, which were scrapped by the coalition government in 2012, said Buck: “There were very specific health inequality targets, for life expectancy differences across the country and mortality differences. The King’s Fund thinks it is time we return to a national health inequality strategy.” And Dr Zubaida Haque, deputy director of the Runnymede Trust, said the figures show the government can no longer continue a one-size-fits-all approach and that ethnic minorities were overrepresented in the worst-paid and key-worker jobs. “The government needs to roll out more economic and social measures that also take into account BAME socioeconomic and housing circumstances, such as overcrowding. At the moment, the government has told older people to self isolate, but that’s not a practical solution for older people living in overcrowded housing.” She added the focus on PPE must include all key workers, not just the NHS. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “We have commissioned urgent work from Public Health England to understand the different factors that may influence the way someone is affected by this virus. We will set out full details in due course.” Nick Stripe, ONS head of health analysis, said: “General mortality rates are normally higher in more deprived areas. “But so far Covid-19 appears to be taking them higher still.” Of the 20,283 Covid-19 registered deaths in England and Wales to 17 April, an overwhelming proportion were of people from the poorest areas.
129	Labour’s ruling national executive committee (NEC) has appointed a four-person panel to investigate the leaked internal report describing a “hyper-factional” environment among party staff hostile to Jeremy Corbyn. The unredacted report, which was leaked last month, reignited the row in the party over Labour’s handling of antisemitism cases, and led to calls for party members named in it to be suspended. A party spokesperson said on Friday that Martin Forde QC would chair the investigation, which will cover both the contents of the report, and the circumstances of its release. A spokesperson said Forde would be supported by three experts in “the law and the Labour party’s structures”, and would examine “the circumstances, contents and release of an internal report”. “The NEC has agreed that the investigation should endeavour to deliver its report by the middle of July,” the spokesperson said. The report included hundreds of private WhatsApp messages from named staff members, many of them expressing hostility towards Corbyn or his close allies and bemoaning Labour’s better-than-expected performance at the 2017 general election. The officials discussed funnelling election campaign funds to favoured candidates, including the former deputy leader Tom Watson. The dossier also named complainants in antisemitism cases. It was prepared as a background document, intended to be submitted alongside Labour’s response to the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s investigation into the party. When Labour’s lawyers decided the document should not be submitted, it was leaked. Starmer said at the time he was “shocked” by its contents, and by the fact that it had been published. His handling of the sensitive issue is regarded by both sides of the party as an early test of his leadership. In addition to Forde, the panellists will be three Labour peers: Debbie Wilcox, a former leader of Newport city council; Larry Whitty, a former Labour party general secretary, and Ruth Lister, an emeritus professor of social policy at Loughborough University. Some leftwing NEC members objected to the makeup of the panel. They argued for the veteran campaigner Lord Dubs, who is Jewish, to be included – but were defeated 18-16 in a vote. A Labour source said:, “Keir and Angela [Rayner] hold Alf Dubs in the highest regard, as we all do, but it is crucial that the panel is not just independent but perceived as independent. Keir did not think it would be appropriate for someone who was a high profile supporter in his leadership campaign to be involved.” A spokesperson for Momentum said: “It is critical that the inquiry focus on the very serious allegations of racism, sexism, senior staff members trying to sabotage Labour’s 2017 general election campaign and a failure to pursue antisemitism cases. “In any other organisation, members accused of racism, sexism and misuse of funds would be suspended pending investigation. Labour should be no different, and we call on Labour to suspend those named in the report while the investigation is ongoing.”
138	A seven-year-old boy asked his father “who’s next Daddy? Is it going to be you or is it going to be me?”, after his mother and grandmother died with coronavirus four days apart. Chris Cadby lost his wife Julianne, 49, after her own mother, Joan, 84, died on Easter Sunday. Both deaths were linked to Covid-19. Cadby, from Cardiff, told Sky News: “I had to find the strength to tell our son, Evan, what had happened. It was heartbreaking as I had only just told him a few days earlier his nanny had died. He hadn’t seen his mum for a week because she had been suffering with the virus.” Cadby had also been in hospital with coronavirus, and Evan had had to stay with Cadby’s brother-in-law. The schoolboy tested positive but has not had any symptoms. Other recent victims include a doctor from the Manchester Royal Infirmary who had switched from his normal role as a plastic surgeon to treating patients with coronavirus. Furqan Ali Siddiqui died on Thursday and is survived by six children, who live in Pakistan with his wife, Fazia, who is also a doctor. A spokesperson for Manchester University NHS foundation trust said: “It is with great sadness that we can announce the death of a member of staff who worked at Wythenshawe hospital. “Dr Furqan Ali Siddiqui was a clinical fellow in our burns and plastics department at Wythenshawe hospital and sadly died on 30 April. He was being treated for Covid-19. We extend our sincere condolences and deepest sympathies to Furqan’s family and all our thoughts are with them at this incredibly difficult time.” At Southampton general hospital, Thursday’s Clap for Carers was held in honour of a linen porter who had worked there for more than 20 years. Mike Brown, 61, had tested positive for coronavirus and died in hospital while receiving treatment, a spokesperson for University Hospital Southampton NHS foundation trust confirmed. Paula Head, the chief executive of University Hospital Southampton, said: “He was well recognised and popular with so many staff. Once nominated by colleagues for a Hospital Heroes award for always going above and beyond, he shared his good sense of humour with everyone around. “Our thoughts are with Mike’s partner, Sandy, and his family. He will remain fondly in our thoughts, particularly those of his close colleagues and the staff he worked with on the wards regularly.”
139	Facebook has removed a page belonging to David Icke after social media platforms came under pressure for giving a platform to the conspiracy theorist, whose bogus messages about Covid-19 have continued to gain viewers. A page belonging to the former footballer was removed for repeatedly violating Facebook’s policies on harmful misinformation, the company said on Friday. But while the deleted page had more than 770,000 followers, a secondary account with more than 68,000 followers remained active. A verified account for him also remained on Twitter, which said it was prioritising the removal of Covid-19 content when it had a call to action that could potentially cause harm. The move by Facebook came ahead of a call by an anti-hate group, the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), for social networks to remove Icke from their platforms. It was backed by figures including the doctors and broadcasters Christian Jessen, Dawn Harper and Pixie McKenna. It also comes against the backdrop of attacks on mobile phone masts across the UK and elsewhere at a time amid concern about the impact of baseless theories linking coronavirus to 5G networks. A report by the CCDH claims that Icke’s conspiracies about coronavirus have been viewed more than 30m times. Based on an analysis of videos that feature Icke speaking about the coronavirus on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, the group described him as the leading producer of misinformation on Covid-19. Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the CCDH, said that Facebook must now look at what he described as a vast network of pages and groups in which Icke’s content was being shared. “While people around the world make enormous sacrifices to stall this pandemic, social media firms are instead profiting from the proliferation of misinformation on their platforms,” he said. “Misinformation puts all of our lives at risk by encouraging the public not to comply with clinical guidance. The action against Icke’s social media presence was also welcomed by Hope Not Hate, which said: “Icke’s deluded, often antisemitic, posts encourage harmful lies to spread. Other platforms should follow Facebook’s lead.” The local television station London Live was sanctioned recently after the media regulator, Ofcom, found it had posed a threat to the public’s health by showing a lengthy interview with Icke about the coronavirus pandemic. Icke, who has repeated discredited claims that the pandemic is linked to 5G, had used the broadcast to claim without evidence that the pandemic was cover for a supposed global world order to crash the economy, end the use of cash payments and track people.
140	Is 100,000 enough for tracking and tracing? The government has been accused of counting some tests prematurely, reportedly expanding its daily count to include tests that have been sent out in the post, rather than those actually carried out in labs. While it denies the charge, regardless of whether the 100,000 target has been met, countries that have taken a “test, trace, isolate” approach are running a far higher proportion of tests to positive cases than the UK. Germany, which is down to fewer than 1,000 daily positive cases, is performing nearly 1m tests per week. South Korea is doing 15,000 tests per day, but has had no more than 100 daily cases since the beginning of April. So, for a robust “test, trace, isolate” regime in the UK, the number of tests would need to be vastly increased or we would need to wait for the number of cases in the community to fall significantly. Will healthcare workers be screened? There have been calls for healthcare workers to undergo routine weekly screening to ensure that transmission between staff and patients is minimised. This is particularly important as people are known to be infectious before symptoms appear, meaning that hospitals could become hotspots for infection. However, regular screening of staff requires testing to be performed in hospitals or very nearby, and may also require staff to be available to take swabs. The government’s approach of centralising testing raises questions about how quickly local capacity could be rolled out to facilitate this. Is the right data being collected and reported? Questions have been raised about whether the data currently being collected is sufficient to support a “test, trace, isolate” programme, and community surveillance to pick up early signs of upticks in transmission in an area. Are testing centres starting to collect postcode information of those tested, for instance, or are they merely recording whether samples come back positive or negative? There are also concerns among statisticians that data is not being reported in a way that allows useful analysis. For instance, breakdowns of the number of positive tests from hospital patients, health workers and other groups have not been provided, and it is not clear why so many of the tests being performed appear to be repeat tests of the same person on the same day. Are the right people getting the tests? The rationale of the prioritisation of different groups – testing has this week been expanded to key workers, those who need to go out to work and over-65s – has not been clearly explained and there are still some groups reporting serious problems getting access to testing. Care home staff, in particular, have struggled to access tests, despite signs that the numbers of deaths in care homes will be very high. Given that care home residents do not have the option to self-isolate, it is crucial that staff are tested – and ideally regularly screened – to keep the virus out. Is the quality of testing good enough? In the rapid surge of testing, including at drive-throughs around the country, concerns have emerged about the reliability of test results and delays. Staff working in “mega-labs” have reported concerns about mislabelling of samples and lost results. Some people, including healthcare staff, have complained of waiting days or weeks for a result. There are also concerns that many drive-through sites are asking members of the public to self-administer swab tests, which could result in the samples being suboptimal.
141	ExxonMobil has swung to a loss for the first quarter after a writedown of almost $3bn (£2.4bn) on the value of its oil reserves because of a collapse in US oil prices. The US oil company reported a loss of $610m for the first quarter of the year following the outbreak of coronavirus, compared to a profit of $2.4bn in the same months last year. The financial slump includes a $2.9bn writedown to the value of its oil reserves after oil prices tumbled by more than 70% this year due to the sudden drop in demand for oil and transport fuels as major economies impose Covid-19 lockdowns. In the US, oil prices turned negative for the first time owing to a catastrophic oversupply of oil that risks overwhelming traditional oil storage facilities and has forced traders to turn to empty crude tankers, rail freight containers and salt caverns to store the unwanted crude. Darren Woods, Exxon’s chief executive, said: “Covid-19 has significantly impacted near-term demand, resulting in oversupplied markets and unprecedented pressure on commodity prices and margins.” The price of US oil, known as West Texas Intermediate (WTI), climbed to around $20 a barrel on Friday ahead of planned production cuts from the world’s largest oil producers which are due to begin this month. The global oil price, Brent crude, rose to more than $26 a barrel. Chevron, the second largest oil company in the US, said it would rein in its annual spending plans by a further $2bn this year to $14bn, down sharply from its original $20bn spending budget, in order to safeguard the company’s shareholder dividends. Royal Dutch Shell became one of the first major oil companies to cut its shareholder payouts for this year by slashing its dividend by two-thirds. The company’s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, said Shell would reduce the dividend for the first time since the second world war because it was “prudent” in the current environment. Exxon, Chevron and BP have all held their dividend in place for this quarter. Analysts expect the impact of the global oil market downturn on oil companies to be more severe in the second-quarter results.
142	The Foreign Office has obstructed a search for truth into the death of 19-year-old motorcyclist Harry Dunn, lawyers for his family have claimed prior to a potentially tense meeting with aides to Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary. Dunn died in August when his motorcycle collided with a car driven by Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a US intelligence officer stationed at a US spy base at RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire. Sacoolas immediately admitted to the police she had caused the accident by driving on the wrong side of the road. She then left the country a fortnight later claiming diplomatic immunity. The US government has rejected a Home Office request for her to return to the UK to stand trial. The family had also written to Donald Trump urging him to reconsider his refusal to send her back to the UK, but the US government on Thursday again rejected the plea. Downing Street insists it backed the Dunn campaign to persuade Sacoolas to return to face UK courts and had objected to her departure every step of the way. But the family’s lawyers, after leaks of internal memos and evidence given to the foreign affairs select committee, believe they were misled. The UK shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, has called for a parliamentary inquiry into how the family were treated. It is understood that Keir Starmer, the Labour leader and former director of public prosecutions, is also taking an interest. The family is seeking a judicial review into the handling of the case, which could reveal if there were any conflicting currents within the Foreign Office over whether to resist the US view that she was covered by diplomatic immunity. Any court hearing might also reveal exchanges between the Northamptonshire police and the Foreign Office over the degree of discretion the police had to arrest and prosecute Sacoolas, even if the Foreign Office (FCO) told the police she had diplomatic immunity. Radd Seiger, the lawyer for the Dunn family, said he would be demanding the truth at Friday’s meeting: “The foreign secretary has stated in each of our meetings with him that the FCO fought to keep Mrs Sacoolas here. “The FCO’s initial position, like ours, was that Mrs Sacoolas did not have diplomatic immunity. So why did they cave in on this interpretation of the law in a matter of three working days? To make matters worse, they failed to pass any of this to Northants police, who were kept totally in the dark for 14 days when it was their job to establish whether she had immunity or not. Shockingly, the police were not told anything until the day after Mrs Sacoolas left, depriving them of their ability to investigate matters.” Sacoolas left the UK on 15 September after the Foreign Office agreed she had diplomatic immunity, and the US refused to waive it. Internal memos suggest the Foreign Office decided she had immunity, a complex point of law, within a week of Dunn’s death. Seiger’s argument turns on exchanges between the Foreign Office and the US State Department in the immediate wake of the crash that led to Foreign Office lawyers concluding she did have diplomatic immunity, he says. The Foreign Office negotiated a treaty with the US and the UK that waived immunity for US staff at the Croughton base, but the treaty was silent on the status of the staff’s dependants, such as Sacoolas, leading the US to argue she had immunity. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “We have deep sympathy for Harry’s family. We have done and will continue to do everything we properly can to ensure that justice is done. “As the foreign secretary set out in parliament, Anne Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity whilst in the country under the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations. “We consistently called for Anne Sacoolas’s immunity to be waived before she left the UK. Both the prime minister and the foreign secretary have been clear with the US that the refusal to extradite her amounts to a denial of justice, and that she should return to the UK.”
143	Allowing individual athletes such as Adam Peaty to begin training again in high-performance centres will be the first step towards reopening British sport, it was agreed on Friday. But as reported by the Guardian this week, any decision to give the green light to resume elite sport will be not made until at least 7 May when the prime minister, Boris Johnson, is due to announce a timetable towards easing Britain’s lockdown status. The major sports that attended the meeting – including football, cricket, horse racing and rugby union, as well as UK Sport – were also reminded by the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, that elite sport would return only when it was deemed absolutely safe to do so. A DCMS spokesperson said: “We held an initial, constructive meeting with medical representatives from a number of professional and elite sports bodies, government and PHE to step up planning on what may need to be done so that athletes could return to training, when it is deemed safe to do so. “This would be ahead of any return to competitive top-level sport which would only happen when medical experts advise that this can be done safely. Discussions with the sports bodies will continue on this.” Most of the meeting, which lasted just over an hour, was focused on proposals from a working group led by the UK Sport chief executive, Sally Munday, which has been tasked with determining the steps needed to make it safe for athletes to return to training. One person with knowledge of the meeting said that Munday had reflected the views of several national governing bodies, Olympic and Paralympic groups and sports medical experts, and the primary focus of the discussions was on agreeing “sensible steps towards a timetable to get sport reopening again”. The first step, the source added, was on opening high-performance training centres for individual sports and athletes such as Peaty. However, it was accepted by all parties that loosening the rules for sport would not happen in isolation from the rest of society – and that it was also important to get the sequencing right in the coming weeks and months. More meetings are planned, although a date for the next one has not yet been confirmed.
144	My father, the sculptor Alan Thornhill, who has died aged 98, is best known as the creator of the Putney Sculpture Trail, the largest outdoor collection of work by one artist in London. At the studio he set up in Putney, south-west London, in 1959, Alan pioneered a radical and improvisatory approach to claywork that involved dispensing with an internal armature and allowing content to emerge from his unconscious. Abstract pieces of the 1960s developed into large groups of figures. Pacifism, Jungian psychology and world conflicts were themes that emerged organically in his work. Alan also made a large number of portrait heads from life, including of Tom Stoppard, Colin Davis, AS Neill, Basil Bunting and Enoch Powell. Alan taught sculpture at Morley College in Lambeth for 17 years from 1970 and was subsequently a trustee and then teacher at the Frink School of Figurative Sculpture in Staffordshire, founded by Rosemary Barnett. He was born in London, the son of Stewart Thornhill (who started life as Sigmund Dornberger), a German Jewish importer of china and glass, and his wife, Louisa (nee Warren). Alan grew up in Fittleworth, Sussex, and was educated at Radley college, in Oxfordshire, and Oxford University, where he studied history. He was an officer in the Gloucestershire Regiment during the second world war and aide-de-camp to Gen Sir Percy Hobart. He took part in the D-day landings and later became a conscientious objector. Having had Reichian therapy in Norway after the war, he decided to work with his hands and enrolled at Camberwell Art School, in south-east London, where he began his lifelong exploration of clay. He married the painter Sheila Denning in 1950 and set up Hawkley Pottery, near Stroud, Gloucestershire, in 1951. Growing tired of the repetitive nature of pottery, Alan began to make figurative sculptures in clay, exploring the theme of communication. Moving back to London, he set up the studio in Putney, which he maintained until his death. In later life Alan painted prolifically, creating self-portraits, still lifes and landscapes of Gloucestershire and France, together with large bold charcoal drawings. He moved from London to Stroud in 1994 with his partner, Kate Shuckburgh, and in 2012 had a retrospective at Stroud’s Museum in the Park. Alan donated nine bronze pieces to Wandsworth borough council which form the permanent Putney Sculpture Trail near the Thames, opened in 2008. The council leader, Ravi Govindia, said that Alan’s “creative genius has provided a long-lasting legacy for the people of Putney. His contribution to cultural life in the borough cannot be overestimated.” Alan is survived by three children – myself and Teresa, from his marriage, which ended in divorce in 1970, and Philip, from a relationship with Suzie Bittner – and five grandchildren, Isaac, Bethan, Jake, Maya and Eva.
145	Some British Airways staff were volunteering in hospitals serving drinks to NHS nurses; about half were furloughed on coronavirus lockdown; a scant few were actually operating flights when a life-changing email was sent their way. One pilot, on unpaid leave, was having tea at home when his daughter burst in, upset, to relay news reports that 12,000 BA staff faced the sack – more than one in four of the workforce. Only a little later did the message arrive from the airline’s chief executive, Alex Cruz, confirming “possible reductions in headcount”. Although ominous warnings about aviation’s biblical losses and bankrupt airlines had been ringing out for weeks, the announcement to the stock exchange by BA’s parent company, International Airlines Group (IAG), still came as a shock. Until that moment the biggest, most profitable carriers, had made only smaller cuts, furloughing staff and reducing fleet orders. And around Europe, governments were rushing to guarantee the survival of their flag carriers, with billions of state aid. As Air France and KLM sealed a €10bn package between them, and German ministers pledged to back Lufthansa, Cruz told his staff that there was “no government bailout standing by for BA”. But why? A refrain echoed by several past and present employees is that BA was “never an airline to let a crisis go to waste”. The situation was, as Cruz headlined a previous all-staff memo in March, a matter of survival. But, if convincing the government to resist bailing out all airlines meant BA could ultimately survive a crisis that might fatally wound its nemesis, Virgin Atlantic, and let it force through unwelcome changes on its own unionised workforce – for BA bosses, recovery would be sweet indeed. Despite Cruz’s blunt words on state aid, the decision was a matter for owners IAG, which also owns Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus. So far it has remained tight-lipped – but on Friday it accepted a €1bn loan backed by the Spanish government, just three days after the BA redundancies were announced. IAG’s chief executive, Willie Walsh, has long set out his stall against handouts in the UK. In January, when most carriers were still regarding coronavirus as a blip that might impact long-haul routes to China, the future of one regional carrier, Flybe, was deemed significant enough for government intervention. But as ministers looked set to offer assistance, IAG cried foul. Flybe was owned by a consortium led by Virgin Atlantic, BA’s old rival, which had grand visions of the doomed airline being its own domestic feeder network as it became a “second flag carrier” at Heathrow. Later, when the full extent of the coronavirus crisis hit, and airlines led by Virgin called for a bailout for the beleaguered sector, IAG was quick to distance itself. Walsh said they were having “no dialogue with any governments” for handouts, adding: “I think governments would expect airlines to look at self-help before they would call on governments to provide state aid.” They did, however, “avail of general facilities” offered in Rishi Sunak’s economic stimulus: about 22,000 BA staff were furloughed, worth up to £110m. Meanwhile, in a sealed IAG office inside BA’s Waterside HQ near Heathrow, a team of around 80, largely the bean counters of the group, set to work on emergency plans that would revive a long-held vision on how to slash BA’s costs. What emerged later on Tuesday night in an email to unions was a proposal of not just job losses but vastly reduced terms and conditions for long-serving pilots, cabin crew and ground staff. Far from cushioning those made redundant, or incentivising voluntary redundancy, the airline said it could now afford to only pay the bare statutory minimum. Unite denounced it as “unlawful and immoral”; other employees described it as “a bloodbath” and “being thrown to the wolves”. Staff that keep their jobs will be forced onto the inferior contracts offered to new entrants since 2010. All cabin crew will now be part of the lower-paid “mixed fleet” – set up during bitter strikes over cuts to terms and conditions that Walsh hoped to impose when he first joined BA. Long-serving ground staff at Heathrow face similar moves. For unions, there is little doubt what they see. Unite’s national officer for aviation, Oliver Richardson said BA was “carrying out a brutal act of smash and grab opportunism … simply designed to boost their profits in the future and to try to force other operators out of the UK aviation sector.” Andrew Lobbenberg, an analyst at HSBC, however, says airlines are now not expecting stability for two to three years. “You could say they are securing the future of the business. Clearly people whose terms and conditions are being re-based will argue they are making changes under the cover of the crisis – but you can view it both ways.” IAG is a Spanish-based, multinational group, possibly complicating requests for BA, and any state aid might come with constraints unwelcome to shareholders – and IAG’s biggest shareholder is Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, which grew its stake to 25% in February. However, some in the City and at BA believe that the airline might yet change its tune on state aid once Virgin is either bailed out – or no longer exists. Nonetheless, some carriers expecting state aid are taking decisions that Lobbenberg says would “be challenging for labour or governments”, such as Lufthansa closing its no-frills operation Germanwings. With the entire sector in such upheaval and no clear, imminent route back to mass travel, it is hard to see what kind of industry, let alone BA, will emerge. Yet few believe BA would abandon Gatwick, or give up valuable Heathrow slots – and losing a quarter of the workforce may not mean shrinking operations by the same amount. Iberia pilots were forced into “productivity improvements” of 20% more hours when they were “restructured” after joining IAG in the wake of the financial crisis. As Lobbenberg points out: “Vueling is young, and Aer Lingus was restructured by Willie Walsh after 9/11 … That leaves BA.” Walsh, given a farewell cake and send-off by fellow airline executives in early March before cancelling his retirement, may now finish the job he started. Who’s getting what? Although BA is not receiving state aid, around €30bn in grants, loans and guarantees look set to be offered to competitors around Europe. The main expected beneficiaries are: Lufthansa Group The German government has pledged to back the flag carrier, although a €10bn package has yet to be agreed. For its subsidiaries, Swiss Air has a €1.4bn loan guarantee, Austrian has been pledged €800m and Brussels Airlines may get €290m from their respective governments Air France-KLM The French government has offered its carrier €7bn in loans and guarantees, while the Netherlands is looking at a €3bn loan, TUI Group The German state bank has loaned €1.8bn to the holiday group and airline. Alitalia Italy spent around €1.2bn nationalising the bankrupt carrier and has earmarked another €500m to help it through SAS Received loan guarantees worth a total of €800m from Scandinavian states. Norwegian Set to receive a €300m bailout from the government if creditors and shareholders accept debt write-off plans In the US United, Delta, American, South West and others are sharing up to $50bn from the US stimulus package – half of which will go directly to support payroll, with a further $25bn available in loans.
146	The government is facing a challenge to the legality of the coronavirus lockdown by a wealthy businessman who fears it will kill more people than it saves. Simon Dolan, whose Jota Aviation company has been delivering personal protective equipment (PPE) to the NHS, has put the health secretary on notice that he intends to issue proceedings for a judicial review, unless the government reverses some of the lockdown measures and reinstates freedom of movement. He is taking the action, which echoes that taken by Gina Miller over Brexit, on the grounds that the lockdown was both legally defective and disproportionate in law. He is also seeking minutes of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) meetings this year, some of which involved Boris Johnson’s adviser Dominic Cummings. “Failure to do so [release the minutes] will result in an application for disclosure if proceedings have to be issued,” says the “letter before action” that has been sent to Matt Hancock. Dolan, the author of a book called How to Make Millions Without a Degree, says he is not taking the case to throw the country into chaos, but to restore the public’s right to decide for themselves if they want to visit friends, go to work or stay indoors, according to a crowdfunding page. He has offered to “consider not issuing proceedings if serious, alternative, less draconian suggested restrictions were imposed”. His lawyer, Michael Gardner, said the government had been given until Thursday to reply to the letter. If it does not come back with a satisfactory answer, he will apply for an urgent court hearing in the same way Miller did when she challenged the prorogation of parliament last year. Dolan runs his chartered airline business out of Southend in Essex and employs about 600 people across 10 companies. He said he had no political affiliation but mounted the action because he feared the cure for coronavirus would be “worse than the disease”, with cancer referrals and chemotherapy down and as many as 18,000 extra cancer deaths predicted, according to recent research by University College London. Reports of domestic violence have risen, and police reported early signs of an increase in suicides and suicide attempts. “The lockdown is telling us to stop living to avoid dying,” Dolan said. “To imprison people in their homes is an extremely dramatic decision to make. It is unprecedented and it would have been a brave Boris to say ‘no, we are not going to do that’, but it has gone on too long now, and we need to lift it or loosen it. “Too many people are losing their jobs; people can’t get cancer treatment, there is suicide, domestic violence. Why are we prevaricating? It’s like the government is now keeping this going to justify their original decision, whereas what they should do is say we did this and now we are doing something different.” His action comes as pressure to relax lockdowns extends around the globe, with the most extreme examples in the US, where gun-toting protesters entered Michigan’s state building on Thursday. “It’s not storming the city halls with guns like in America, but British people have done their bit, made their sacrifices but life has to go on and it’s going to be really hard for years to come,” said Dolan. He said the crowdfunding drive was an attempt to test British people’s “backbone” as he was “amazed nobody else was doing something”. A serial entrepreneur, Dolan, 50, from Essex, is worth £142m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. He left school at 16 after clashing with teachers and got his first break at 22, putting a £10 advert in a local paper offering to do people’s accounts. He started his own motor racing team, Jota Sport, in 2008 after his wife bought him a track day as a birthday present, and now lives in Monaco. Dolan said the case was funded all the way to the court but he was advised that the crowdfunding would help the budget if it became a prolonged case and would also help to see “ how much support was out there from the general public”. He said: “When people actually start putting their hands in their pockets it’s a far more powerful message.” Dolan’s lawyer said the challenge rested on three main points: first, that the lockdown is “ultra vires” – outside of legal authority – because it implemented regulations under the Public Health Act 1984 instead of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 or the emergency Coronavirus Act 2020; second, that the government reimposed the lockdown on a “disproportionate” basis in law, using an “over-rigid” test regarding its effect on containing the disease but not its impact on the economy, jobs and wider health; and third, that it breached the European convention on human rights covering the right to liberty, family life, education and property. The Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment.
186	I first met Irrfan Khan 21 years ago in a cheap beach hotel in Mumbai. I was 28 and casting my debut film, The Warrior, about a conflicted enforcer in feudal India. None of the actors I’d seen were right. I’d tell them I wanted to make a western, a mix of Robert Bresson and Sergio Leone, and their eyes would glaze. They weren’t interested in doing a movie without songs or romance or much dialogue, filmed far away in Rajasthan and the Himalayas. A film which wasn’t typically British and was shot in Hindi, but wasn’t totally Indian, either. Irrfan walked in the room and in that moment I knew he was right. He had this incredible presence and beautiful face and unusual puffy eyes. He loved world cinema, got the tone and references and liked the challenge of telling a story without words. Afterwards I said to my friend Amit, with whom I was casting: “He looks like someone who’s killed a lot of people, but feels really bad about it.” The only problem was that he seemed such a wonderful, warm guy we had to toughen him up a bit. That was part of the fun. He was 34 then and got better-looking and more in shape as he aged. We went to the desert and the mountains for the shoot and he saw snow for the first time. It was very low-budget and pre-digital, so there was no playback or wriggle-room. You just watched him do a take, then went: “That was amazing! OK … moving on!” Before that, Irrfan had been thinking about quitting acting because he was getting bored. He hadn’t been offered a role that allowed him to demonstrate his great gift, which was to say so much with just a glance. He elevated simple lines to brilliant cinematic moments, could make you feel something very complex and emotional by doing very little. He was a real movie star. Over the years, The Warrior cast and crew stayed in touch and had reunions, which is quite unusual in this business. There was a real connection, and Irrfan – soulful, tall, elegant, slightly otherworldly – was our spiritual leader. Even before he was famous, he had immense dignity and charisma. Some actors can be quite ordinary when they’re not done up. He didn’t have to be in costume. Even when people didn’t know who he was – in a shop, or walking down the street – they would stop and stare. Once we were on a flight together, in economy, and every five minutes stewardesses came up to ask if he needed anything. The Warrior won Baftas and the Sutherland award for best first film at the London film festival; the next day we went to my mum’s house in Hackney for lunch. Miramax bought the US rights but Harvey Weinstein put the film on a shelf for years which killed it. And it was disqualified from the foreign-language category of the Oscars – that upset Irrfan, too; he wasn’t without ambition. But we both got noticed and he went on to make movies with Danny Boyle, Michael Winterbottom, Wes Anderson and Ang Lee. I worked with David Fincher recently and asked him how he’d come across me. He said: “Oh, my best friend came over with a DVD and told me I had to watch it.” That turned out to be Brad Pitt, and the DVD was Senna. I think Pitt had been told to watch it by Irrfan, when they worked together on A Mighty Heart. No matter what the movie, I always felt Irrfan was the best and most believable thing in it, because he was so honest – everything he did had soul and truth. As his career took off, he remained the same. He’d always been outward-looking and international, which is why he could so seamlessly work across so many genres and countries. Fame never changed him. We’d try to meet up whenever I was in India or he in London. We’d talk movies and go to the British Museum and Primrose Hill and our kids would play football together. When he was having treatment here I’d visit him in hospital and we’d head to the local park or cafe, or he’d come to our home. He talked about his illness in a way I’ve never before heard anyone discuss cancer. He was extremely inquisitive and wanted to understand exactly what was going on. In 2018, I invited Irrfan and his eldest son to an early cut of my Diego Maradona documentary. “Why did you make this film?” he asked in the edit suite a few days later. “What does this film say about you?” His notes were really tough! He wanted me to make the film more personal; as much about me as about Maradona. They were good notes. Irrfan knew me well enough to say he didn’t like that cut - but he didn’t want to tell me in front of 50 people. He returned to India and we’d message from time to time. Sometimes he’d reply and sometimes his wife, Sutapa. It’s difficult when a friend lives on the other side of the world. The other week I found some pictures from that first casting session in the dodgy hotel from 1999 and I sent them to him. Sutapa wrote back saying: “Oh, he’s wearing his lucky black shirt.” In the spring Irrfan sent me a photo of his new calf. He was always telling me to come and visit his farm outside Mumbai; I never got there. You always think there’s time and then you run out of it. He and I were so in sync for a while, partly I think because the film we made was slightly out of step with the rest of the world. It didn’t neatly fit in, and neither did we. It’s like losing a brother. He used to ring me up at 2am and I’d be worried something bad had happened. “Oh no,” he’d say, “I just missed you and wanted to chat.”
187	Exactly how terrible are the next months and years going to be? As a generally apocalyptically minded sort of person, I’ve been feeling some pride in watching my favourite question become everyone else’s favourite question, too; it’s like being a 19th-century aristocrat and seeing your debutante daughter become the star of the London season. But in deciding who to listen to, and thus how alarmed to be, it’s easy to overlook a crucial factor: in a crisis as all-consuming as this one, nobody – not academic experts, not media commentators, not that one friend who keeps urging you to be less (or more) worried than you are – is a completely neutral observer. Because predictions about the future aren’t solely about the future. They’re also coping mechanisms for dealing with the present. This is obvious enough in the case of the strenuous optimist who insists that in a few weeks everything will be back to normal; she’s clearly attempting to generate a sense of security in a time of uncertainty. But it’s been fascinating to witness the opposite, too: the people in my social circle, and especially my social media feeds, who seem deeply invested in asserting that things will be worse than the rest of us can imagine. (Even professional epidemiologists are engaged in an arms race to predict a longer and longer timeframe for social distancing.) Psychologically, though, this makes sense. When everything’s up in the air, the person foreseeing absolute disaster has found solid ground: at least things won’t get worse than that. Likewise, consider our political reactions to the pandemic. Fury at the government’s response may be highly justified, but if being angry at the Tories has always been central to your personality, to be angry at the Tories now is also a perverse source of comfort. Virtually nothing may be the same, these days – but at least the Tories remain hateable. The point here isn’t to dismiss any particular outlook on the grounds that it’s partly a coping mechanism. (Nobody gets by without some coping mechanisms. Mine include writing columns about other people’s.) But it’s useful to see the role they play, if only to stop yourself spiralling into anxiety next time someone you trust paints an especially dark picture of the future. They may be proven right, of course. But what’s certain is they’re a human, engaging in their own private methods for managing their emotions. Besides, it’s worth remembering that this calamity is further evidence for the truth that most of us, most of the time, have no idea what’s coming. “On your pessimistic days you should remember, three months ago you would have dismissed the idea of the world being locked down with a pandemic,” the economist Kaushik Basu observed recently. “Extrapolating from your poor record of forecasting, you should realise your current forecast of future gloom may also be completely wrong.” I don’t think that’s an argument for replacing pessimism with optimism, but for trying to suspend both. There’s a lightness that comes with giving up, if only a little, the demand to know what tomorrow holds. They say that if you expect the worst, you’ll only be pleasantly surprised, but that way you still have to feel glum now. The real skill – while doing your best to prepare for the future – is to avoid expecting anything.

188	My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half. We enjoy a very active sex life. However, some of the things he is sexually attracted to are just abhorrent to me. He enjoys being dominated and treated as if he were a woman, with clothes and makeup, and wants me to act as if I were a man, including changing my vocal pitch and calling him derogatory names. I tell him it makes me highly uncomfortable, and he tries to respect that, but sometimes, in the heat of the moment, he’ll ask and I feel pressured to say yes, so as not to ruin the mood. I don’t want to hurt his feelings but it seems the only way he listens is if I tell him my thoughts on it in a very assertive way. His argument is that if I did it more often, then I would start to like it because that’s how he got interested in the things I like. The difference is that he didn’t have any previous experience with my kinks, whereas I already had an established dislike for his. I love him with all my heart, and in every other aspect of our relationship I’m 100% satisfied, but we are having trouble resolving this. No matter how adventurous or conventional one’s sex life is, if both partners don’t agree with doing something, then it stops being fun and tips into something else. If you feel pressured into doing something sexual, is it still consensual? I contacted sex and relationship psychotherapist Silva Neves (cosrt.org.uk). His first thought was that there wasn’t a lot of hope of you getting to like this kink “because you’re using words such as abhorrent; you have an established dislike of his kink and when you start with that, it’s really hard to change and meet halfway. For your boyfriend it was different; when he was introduced to your kink, he was neutral towards it, tried it and was able to incorporate it into his sex life. Because of that, he expects you to be able to do the same; but not all kinks are equal.” Of course, in various aspects of relationships, we sometimes have to try new things, and compromise, but if he is asking you to do something that is really not acceptable to you, Neves said, “This goes into a question of sexual health principles, and one of them is consent.” In other words, you have to want to do it, not just do it to please him. If you don’t, over time, you will not only start to resent each other but if you don’t feel relaxed during sex, it may well kill your sex drive, because you’ll be constantly worrying you’ll be asked to do something you don’t want to. You say that this is a no-go for you, but in other ways you are very happy, so what to do? “A lot of couples have different erotic worlds that don’t match,” Neves said, “but you can still have a successful relationship.” He suggested shifting your focus from “How can I enjoy this kink?” to accepting that it’s really OK to not like something and not try to force yourself. What you need is an honest conversation – don’t wait until you are having sex. “Honesty is more important than sugar-coating it,” Neves advised. “If you try to do that, he may think you’re leaving the door ajar and if he just pushes it a bit more, you may give in. Over time this will erode the relationship.” Instead, Neves suggested talking to him with love, kindness and empathy. “You can talk about all the other things you can do together but make it very clear that this one thing is not for you.” Also make it clear that you aren’t asking him to repress his kink, just that you don’t want to do it with him. “So you may decide,” Neves said, “that he explores that kink with other people and you open up the relationship to include that, or that he masturbates thinking about it on his own, or finds some erotica to fantasise over, so that he doesn’t have to repress it. He has to find ways of expressing his fantasy, because that side of his sexuality sounds really important to him, so he shouldn’t feel ashamed about it. But you have to think about the boundaries of your relationship.” It’s important to think about how he can give vent to his kink without involving you, because to deny it would erode his sense of self over time. Neither of you is right or wrong, but you have very different needs and they must both be recognised and respected. If you can manage this, it bodes well for future stumbling blocks in your relationship. Every week Annalisa Barbieri addresses a family-related problem sent in by a reader.

189	A rising international force of rebel botanists armed with chalk has taken up street graffiti to highlight the names and importance of the diverse but downtrodden flora growing in the cracks of paths and walls in towns and cities across Europe. The idea of naming wild plants wherever they go – which began in France – has gone viral, with people chalking and sharing their images on social media. More than 127,000 people have liked a photo of chalked-up tree names in a London suburb, while a video of botanist Boris Presseq of Toulouse Museum of Natural History chalking up names to highlight street flowers in the French city has had 7m views. Presseq told the Guardian: “I wanted to raise awareness of the presence, knowledge and respect of these wild plants on sidewalks. People who had never taken the time to observe these plants now tell me their view has changed. Schools have contacted me since to work with students on nature in the city.” France banned pesticide use in parks, streets and other public spaces in 2017 and in gardens from 2019, leading to a surge in awareness of urban wild flowers in the country. French botanist and campaigner Sophie Leguil, who lives in London, set up the More Than Weeds campaign to change perceptions of urban plants in the UK after helping to spread the Sauvages de ma rue (“wild things of my street”) chalking campaign in France led by Tela Botanica. She has won permission to chalk up Hackney’s highways and make chalk trails to highlight the forgotten flora at our feet and is asking other councils to allow the same. “The pesticide ban in France has played a major role as it has forced local authorities and mentalities to change, and raised awareness,” said Leguil. “I’ve been wanting to do it on a larger scale, with permission, and I hope to get more authorities interested in creating trails. We talk a lot about plant blindness – what if putting names on plants could make people look at them in a different way? I despair at how sanitised London has become. Plants can be managed differently, with benefits – cost-saving, biodiversity, education.” In the UK it is illegal to chalk anything – hopscotch, art or botanical names – on paths or highways without permission, even if it educates, celebrates and fosters interest and knowledge in nature. One anonymous London tree name chalker said: “I’ll keep labelling as I go on my daily walks. I think it’s really tapped into where people are right now. “Botanical chalking gives a quick blast of nature connection, as the words encourage you to look up and notice the tree above you, the leaves, the bark, the insects, the sky. And that’s all good for mental health. None of us can manage that much – living through a global pandemic is quite enough to be getting on with. But it’s brought me a great amount of joy.” UK Plantlife spokesman Trevor Dines said the charity could not condone breaking the law, but added: “The incredible response to graffiti plant names is astonishing and I think it’s part of something profound. It’s as if the plant is declaring its own place in our world. “In a recent YouGov poll, just 6% of 16- to 24-year-olds were able to correctly name a picture of a wild violet. The same poll showed nearly 70% of respondents would like to be able to identify more wild flowers.” With less spraying and weeding, we might expect to see up to 400 plant species on walls and paths, he suggests. That is 10% of our wild flora richness. “One survey of pavements in Sheffield found 183 different plants, another in Cambridge found 186 species on walls. All these little micro niches build up to a wonderfully complex tapestry,” Dines said. “Every flower counts and will be targeted by pollinators – a patch of nettles can be swamped with caterpillars. And bird’s-foot-trefoil, a not uncommon urban verge plant, is a food plant for more than 160 different invertebrates. If we change our perceptions and see the dandelion flower for what it is – an absolute lifeline to our bees in early spring – we might learn to love them more.” A study by pollinator researchers revealed that many wild urban “weeds” rank very highly for the quantity of nectar and pollen each flower provides, often much higher than a variety of garden plants. The top trumps among the plants they measured included dandelions and their lookalikes – rough hawkbit, cat’s-ear and sow-thistles – plus ragwort, viper’s bugloss, mallows, self-heal, scentless mayweed, love-in-a-mist, wild mignonette, rosebay willowherb, thistles, creeping buttercup and poppies. Andrew Whitehouse, of conservation trust Buglife, said path and wall plants are also important as winter food sources when there is less blossom available for insects such as bumblebees. “Below the concrete, the roots create tiny microhabitats that support woodlice, worms, harvestmen, spiders, baby slugs and snails, which in turn become the food for birds and hedgehogs,” he added. Cllr Jon Burke, of Hackney Council, which has gone pesticide-free in some areas and halved its use overall to increase wild flowers and boost insect biodiversity following public concern, said: “It is absurd that this chalking of plant names is criminal. It is something we welcome as an important and inspiring teaching tool for adults and children. How else will a kid ever know these names? The vocabulary of the natural world helps us access it, love it and desire to protect it.” Criminal law expert James Gray of Drystone Chambers confirmed that chalking plant names in the UK is illegal without permission or “lawful excuse” and a rebel botanist could be fined up to £2,500 for painting or inscribing any picture, letter, sign, or other mark on a path, highway surface, tree or other structure. Referring to Victor Hugo’s famous fictional police inspector, Gray added: “The Javerts of this world will see great harm in the scribbles of rogue botanists and call for prosecutions, others will see it as entirely harmless and perhaps even a refreshing diversion in our streets.” He added: “Where the threshold lies will depend on the attitude of those charged with enforcing the law; beauty (or derangement) is in the eye of the magistrate.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features
190	The government has been urged to arrange post-traumatic stress disorder support for frontline medical staff, whose mental health may be at risk due to the stress of working through the Covid-19 pandemic. In a letter to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, the shadow minister for mental health, Rosena Allin-Khan, said staff needed access to PTSD support and talking therapies, and that monitoring for increased suicide risk should be put in place. “NHS and care staff are breaking down – I see it first-hand, working shifts. It is simply heartbreaking to see the toll this virus is taking on our frontline staff,” she said. “Our frontline NHS and care staff are doing fantastic work in extremely difficult circumstances. They risk their lives every day in order to protect us. Unless our staff are protected, they cannot continue their vital work of keeping us all safe.” Allin-Khan wrote that staff are under increased pressure due to a fear of spreading the virus to patients and loved ones, PPE shortages and witnessing the deaths of patients. “At this time of crisis, staff mental health must be a priority now. It simply cannot be an afterthought once the acute stage of the crisis is over.” Speaking to the health and social care select committee on Friday, Claire Murdoch, the national mental health director for NHS England, confirmed that the NHS was planning for PTSD referrals for frontline staff. “We know it’s been a high-stress environment. We’re planning mental health support right now,” she said. She said ensuring hospital teams offered support through good supervision, debriefs after shifts and making sure shift patterns allowed staff to recuperate would be crucial. “The military are very good at this,” she said. Murdoch added that trusts were investing more in occupational and mental health support for staff and that national helplines with third sector organisations, such as Samaritans, had been set up to support staff. Responding to MPs’ questions, Murdoch also said there appeared to have been an overall drop of around 30-40% in referrals of members of the public to mental health services. But she added that there was no evidence currently for a spike in suicides or self-harm. “We absolutely have not seen that,” she said. “We’re pretty certain that levels of anxiety and distress will have increased for young people. Everyone’s more worried. Lots of people are sleeping less.” The committee heard further evidence that cancer services were being disrupted, with urgent two-week referrals dropping by 63% last week, which Dame Cally Palmer, the national cancer director for NHS England, said was a concern. “Early detection is vital for survival,” she said. She added that it was crucial that screening programmes, many of which have been paused, be restarted. “There have been no national instructions on screening,” she said. “It’s important to make sure that rescheduled screening take place, especially bowel cancer. Cancers are slow growing so 4-6 weeks should not affect survival but we need to get that turned back on.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. Other international helplines can be found at www.befrienders.org.
191	Listen to a playlist of Ammar’s selections: Fela Kuti: Roforofo Fight (Roforofo Fight, 1972) Roforofo Fight is the earliest cohesive expression of Tony Allen and saxophonist Fela Kuti’s Afrobeat sound: part Yoruba polyrhythm, part Nigerian highlife melody, part calypso swing, and all shuffling swagger. Allen and Kuti had been playing together for the best part of eight years at this point, mixing highlife and jazz, but a 1969 trip to the US proved pivotal, exposing Kuti to the radicalism of the Black Panther movement and leading to the formulation of his militant aesthetic Africa ‘70 band. On the title track of Kuti’s second album to be recorded after the trip, Allen takes centre stage with his undulating groove, slapping the snare on the jaunty offbeats to counter Kuti’s forceful diction. An enticing taste of things to come. Fela Kuti: Water No Get Enemy (Expensive Shit, 1975) Afrobeat rhythms seem deceptively simple: a steadily paced, off-kilter shuffle that holds the beat without succumbing to the western convention of landing the snare on the third beat of the bar. Try to play an Allen line, though, and you soon realise how much ghosting and embellishment is going on below the surface – doubles splayed on the first note of a phrase, kick drums scattered throughout. And yet, the groove remains even when it feels like it might fall apart. Water No Get Enemy is the perfect example: a hip-swaying mid-tempo horn line sits atop Allen’s liquid shuffle while Kuti uses the amorphous imagery of water to outline methods of resistance to Nigeria’s reactionary government. Fela Kuti: Zombie (Zombie, 1976) By the mid 70s, Kuti’s politics of resistance was reaching its peak. Zombie was its most forceful expression, Kuti’s lyrics characterising the violent Nigerian army as mindless zombies. You can feel the force of his frustration through his blistering saxophone as it meanders over the highlife guitar line, while Allen’s snappy, shaker-heavy rhythm is the ever-reliable foundation for Kuti’s social message. The song’s success in Nigeria was not without consequences, leading to a severe beating for Kuti, the torching of his studio and his elderly mother being thrown from a window and killed. Tony Allen: Nepa (Never Expect Power Always, 1984) Kuti had a domineering relationship to his bandmates, demanding all recording royalties for himself despite Allen’s role as musical director. As the 70s wore on and the group’s popularity increased, so did the dissent in its ranks. By 1979, Allen had recorded three albums as bandleader and so decided to leave the ‘Africa 70, taking many of its members with him. The greatest recording of his new era is 1984’s Nepa – an attack on the notoriously unreliable Nigerian Electrical Power Authority. Here Allen continues Kuti’s lineage of playful socio-political criticism, this time updating the Afrobeat sound to include dub-inflected electronics and fusion funk. It would become representative of Allen’s all-encompassing musical appetite in the years to come. The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen: The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen (The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen, 2007) As the 90s continued and Allen was establishing himself as an architect of Afrobeat in his own right, especially in the wake of Kuti’s 1997 death, his own genre-eating journey was evolving further into electronics and collaboration. A longtime fan of the genre, Damon Albarn enlisted Allen for his supergroup, The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen, featuring the Clash’s Paul Simonon on bass and the Verve’s Simon Tong on guitar. The sprawling title track is the closest we see Allen to cutting loose behind the kit and producing an unabashed rock sound behind Tong’s voluminous closing solo – a testament to his energetic versatility. Moritz von Oswald: Sounding Line 1 (Sounding Lines, 2015) Perhaps the strangest and least well-known of Allen’s collaborations is that with the techno producer Moritz von Oswald, who replaced his longtime drummer Vladislav Delay with Allen for his 2015 album Sounding Lines. Allen produces a truly remarkable sound: a warped and manipulated series of electronics. The opening track sees Allen superimpose an Afrobeat shuffle on to a wobbly dub that builds over 10 minutes to create a simmering, electro dancefloor odyssey. Tony Allen: A Night in Tunisia (A Tribute to Art Blakey and the Messengers, 2017) Allen’s first love was always jazz and he referenced throughout his life the work of rhythmic mastermind Max Roach and explosive powerhouse Art Blakey as major influences. This 2017 Blue Note recording was a welcome opportunity for Allen to finally delve into those roots and lay down his own interpretations. Across its four tracks Allen tackles some of Blakey’s best-loved tunes, like a straight-eighths Moanin’, but his Afrobeat-inflected Night in Tunisia is a work of genius, transforming the horn line into a punchy, driving vamp. Tony Allen: Wolf Eats Wolf (The Source, 2017) Continuing his jazz explorations, Allen delivered his first album of original compositions as a bandleader for legendary jazz label Blue Note. The culmination of his decades of musical exploration, it interweaves metallic electronics with warm percussion, bright horn lines and that ever-present drum language. On Wolf Eats Wolf, Allen is comfortably experimental, putting a Synclavier to work over a highlife guitar line and Kuti-referencing horns to create an eminently danceable new jazz standard. Tony Allen and Jeff Mills: Locked and Loaded (Tomorrow Comes the Harvest, 2018) Never one to be pigeonholed, on 2018’s Tomorrow Comes the Harvest Allen paired up with techno wizard Jeff Mills to further the electronic experiments he had begun with Von Oswald. Largely formulated for modular live performances, the record has a wonderfully loose, improvisatory feel. It hits its stride on the propulsive Locked and Loaded as Allen’s shuffle dissipates into white noise beneath Mills’s distorting sub bass. Even in the grid-work of Mills’ techno, Allen manages to swing. Tony Allen and Hugh Masekela: Never (Lagos Never Gonna Be The Same) (Rejoice, 2020) In 2010, Allen paired up with trumpeter Hugh Masekela, a longtime collaborator and giant of South African jazz. Rejoice was released a decade later, following Masekela’s death in 2018, and now stands as Allen’s last released recording. As its title indicates, the album is a sun-dappled, joyous listening experience celebrating both artists’ effortless ability to make us shake a leg. Never (Lagos Never Gonna Be The Same) plays as an homage to Kuti and it serves as a perfect reminder that although our musical greats ultimately pass on, their legacy lies in each note, ready and willing to be dusted off, played and reinterpreted all over again.
192	Cities around the world are already planning for life after Covid-19, with a series of environmental initiatives being rolled out from Bogotá to Barcelona to ensure public safety and bolster the fight against climate breakdown. Mayors from cities in Europe, the US and Africa held talks this week to coordinate their efforts to support a low-carbon, sustainable recovery from the crisis as national governments begin to implement huge economic stimulus packages. Many cities have already announced measures, from hundreds of miles of new bike lanes in Milan and Mexico City to widening pavements and pedestrianising neighbourhoods in New York and Seattle. The initiatives are designed to allow people to move around urban spaces safely in a world where physical distancing will be the norm for the foreseeable future – and do so without sparking a drastic increase in air pollution. The mayors who took part in the newly formed economic taskforce this week believe these initial schemes point the way to more radical long-term measures that will help tackle inequality and the climate crisis. The mayor of Milan, who is heading the taskforce run by the C40 group of cities, said: “Our immediate priority is to protect the health of our residents and overcome the Covid-19 pandemic. However, we must also look towards how we will keep our people safe in the future. How we structure our recovery efforts will define our cities for decades to come.” The mayors discussed measures ranging from huge retrofitting programmes to make buildings more energy efficient, to mass tree planting and investment in solar and wind power. The mayor of Montréal, Valérie Plante, who attended the video meeting, said: “We need more than ever to position our economic recovery in the context of our fight against climate change. It is also clear to me that our economic recovery must go hand in hand with our social recovery.” Milan has introduced one of Europe’s most ambitious cycling and walking schemes, with 22 miles of streets to be transformed over the summer. In Paris, the mayor has allocated €300m for a network of cycle lanes, many of which will follow existing metro lines, to offer an alternative to public transport. In Bogotá, the Colombian capital, a 75-mile network of streets usually turned over to bicycles one day a week will now be traffic-free all week, and a further 47 miles of bike lanes are being opened to reduce crowding on public transport and improve air quality. New York has unveiled plans to open up 100 miles of streets for “socially responsible recreation” during the Covid-19 crisis, with a focus on areas with the most need, while Oakland, in California, is closing off 75 miles of its streets to passing cars and setting aside up to 10% of streets for recreation. Mexico City is planning 80 miles of temporary bike lanes, and Barcelona is adding 30,000 square metres to its pedestrianised networks and 13 miles to the biking network. In the UK, the Scottish government has announced £10m to create pop-up walking and cycling routes, while mayors in northern England have suggested a national programme to retrofit homes with renewable energy technology. On Thursday Manchester city council announced it would pedestrianise part of Deansgate, in the city centre. In London, boroughs including Lambeth and Hackney have announced measures to widen pavements, close roads to traffic and improve walking and cycling. Dr Rachel Aldred, at the University of Westminster, said the action city leaders take in the next few weeks would be critically important. “This is a really important moment. There is the potential to lock in the reduction in air pollution we have seen over the past weeks if we get this right, but as people begin to go back to work and can’t or don’t feel safe using public transport, there is the potential to instead lock in a huge increase in car use and pollution.” Mark Watts, the chief executive of C40, said mayors had a lot of power to protect their citizens and shape the direction of the recovery. “There is now a hell of a lot of collaboration among very powerful politicians who do think a green economic recovery is absolutely essential,” he said. “We are talking about collectively creating funds that they all put money into which would then support electric vehicles, support rollout of cycle lanes, support retrofitting of buildings … C40 cities using the hundreds of millions of dollars in their pension funds for this and getting very good long-term returns.” Watts said although many of these initial measures had been billed as short term, he expected them to endure. “This is how cities are going to function for the next two years, and probably that will transition – if we have a green economic recovery – into permanence.” Daisy Narayanan, the director of urbanism at Sustrans, agreed that the recovery from the Covid-19 crisis could be “a catalyst for long-lasting change in the way we live and travel, especially in towns and cities. What Covid-19 has also done is to highlight the crossovers between the quality of our places, public health, economy, transport, education, air quality and social justice.” In recent weeks scientists have tentatively linked air pollution to Covid-19 mortality rates and even the spread of the virus. Narayanan added: “Action needs to be taken now which will help people move around without the congestion, pollution and ill-health that comes with car use now and after lockdown is lifted.” Seven things city leaders can do to drive a green, fair recovery from Covid-19 Remove through motor traffic from residential streets and extend pavements near shops, schools and parks to make walking safe and enjoyable for transport and exercise. Introduce safe access routes on foot, bike and scooter from homes to parks and green spaces and introduce automatic pedestrian lights at crossings so people do not have to push buttons and risk infection. Establish safe cycle routes to and from work for key workers, especially hospital staff, by closing roads and carriageways where necessary so people have a safe alternative to private cars and public transport. Create safe walking and cycling routes to and from schools, and close down streets around schools to motor vehicles at drop-off and pickup times. Use libraries, schools and sports stadiums to distribute nutritious, sustainably produced food to communities that need it most, and scale up food waste collection and treatment, including distributing household composting kits and guidance. Retrofit all public buildings, many of which are empty now, drastically improving energy efficiency and creating thousands of green jobs. Work with other cities to invest the billions tied up in city funds and pensions in climate solutions to drive green job creation and create a more resilient and sustainable economy.
193	It’s difficult to imagine that Britain was, until very recently, regarded as a leader in preparing for pandemics. Countries such as Singapore once looked to the UK for lessons in how to prepare for and respond to outbreaks. Now, it’s the other way around. With its number of coronavirus cases exceeding 170,000, and deaths set to climb above 40,000, the UK appears to be playing catch-up with the rest of the world. Britain’s failure to shatter the coronavirus curve couldn’t be further out of step with its past reputation as a leader in this area. The UK’s global health strategy, launched under New Labour in 2008, was a game-changer in the field of global health. The strategy identified how, in an interconnected world, an infectious outbreak in another country was a direct threat to the UK. By building health capacity elsewhere in the world, the government recognised that it could protect its own borders from infectious outbreaks – reflecting the Blairite logic that interventions abroad would bolster security at home. Over the past two decades, the UK has been a trailblazer in funding global health. It’s one of the only countries to have 0.7% of GDP earmarked for overseas development assistance. Public Health England has a global team advising countries across the globe in building capacity to respond to disease, while the UK’s public health rapid support team is frequently deployed around the world to support countries’ response efforts to emerging pathogens. During the Ebola crisis in 2014, for example, the government deployed PHE epidemiologists to work with Sierra Leone’s health ministry, while the Ministry of Defence sent troops to build treatment centres and NHS staff volunteered as healthcare workers. Meanwhile DfID supported clinical trials of vaccines, in collaboration with UK universities. Of course, the UK’s interests in this field were never just about health. Its 2008 strategy was criticised at the time for self-interest – pursuing health policies abroad primarily as a means of protecting the UK from infection, and as a trade opportunity to commodify NHS expertise on the international market. In the febrile political climate that followed 9/11, the threat of an attack – whether in the form of a virus or a terrorist group – loomed large in governments’ imaginations. The UK government saw policies to combat infectious diseases as an extension of this security mindset – in turn shaping how politicians came to view pandemics. This fear of existential risks forged the UK’s global health strategy, but it also helps explain why we found ourselves on the back foot when coronavirus hit. By the time Covid-19 arrived, the memory of such dangers taking place at home had faded; outbreaks seemed like things that happened elsewhere in the world. The last major outbreaks to affect the UK were BSE in the early 1990s and the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in 2001. While these both posed significantly less of a risk to human mortality than Covid-19, they contributed to widespread disruptions and substantial economic losses for farmers. By the time the last foot-and-mouth case had been recorded, in Cumbria, more than six million cattle, pigs and sheep had been slaughtered. Yet in the years that followed these crises, successive governments became complacent – believing they could get away without funding preparedness, as outbreaks were unlikely to happen within their election cycle, if at all. This complacency was amplified by austerity policies. The NHS has endured the most prolonged funding squeeze in its history, which has meant that surge capacity in PPE, ventilators and ICU beds was not purchased, even when Operation Cygnus identified these areas as shortcomings in 2016. Meanwhile the UK’s cuts to investment in public health areas such as smoking, alcohol and obesity have contributed to a rise in entirely preventable chronic conditions, which are now proving significant risk factors for coronavirus. One of the few existential dilemmas the UK has faced over the last decade is Brexit. Somewhat paradoxically, in prioritising Brexit, government ministers dealt another blow to the UK’s preparedness for a threat whose consequences would be deadly. Training for key workers to manage a pandemic was stalled to make space for contingency plans around no-deal Brexit, while the UK missed opportunities for EU-level purchasing of PPE, and parliamentary enquiries into preparedness for infectious disease were delayed and eventually halted due to the 2019 election. Early in the pandemic, the UK made the significant – and potentially fatal – decision to ignore the advice of the WHO, an institution for which the UK is still a top government funder, which recommended a strategy of testing, isolating and contact tracing. This early move now seems like a grave mistake. Jenny Harries, England’s deputy chief medical officer, stated that the UK didn’t need to follow WHO advice – “The clue with the WHO is in its title – it’s a World Health Organization, and it is addressing all countries across the world,” she said at the time. But the assumption that WHO guidelines didn’t apply to us exposed a remarkable hubris in the UK government’s approach to coronavirus. We were no better prepared than the rest of the world. Indeed, we were worse prepared than countries that once looked to us for lessons. On matters of pandemic preparedness, why would any government seek the UK’s advice again? • Clare Wenham is assistant professor of global health policy at the London School of Economics
194	University students find themselves in strange and precarious circumstances. Fifteen per cent are stuck on campus because travel regulations prohibit them from returning home. The remaining 85% are attempting to work remotely without access to campus buildings or support from peers. The good news is that if you’re able to self-motivate now, it’s a skill you can use for the rest of your life. Lockdown has disrupted our normal routines, and the devastating impact of Covid-19 has left many of us contemplating our own mortality. That’s inevitably led to some searching questions about what life is all about. This is actually a valuable use of our time: people who understand what drives them are not only better placed to make choices which will serve their wellbeing and happiness, they’re able to motivate themselves even if the task at hand is unappealing, dull or repetitive (see: revision). Most people never deeply consider what motivates them. After all, society provides compelling goals for us to aspire to from the moment we’re born – whether that’s earning money above and beyond what we need to survive, buying stuff we don’t need, making ourselves resemble society’s narrow beauty paradigms, or getting followers on social media. But as any celebrity will tell you, achieving these goals rarely results in genuine fulfilment. Conversely, if our key psychological needs – purpose, belonging, achievement, love and connection – are being met and whatever we have dedicated our life to honours our driving force, we’re much more likely to feel content, energised and motivated. The most common driving forces I encounter are a desire to make a difference, community and socialising, freedom and independence, fairness and justice, and competition. Most people are galvanised to an extent by all of the above, but they’ll have a dominant motivator. If you’re having trouble working out which yours is, there are two tests I’d recommend. First of all: what’s your desert island object and what does it represent to you? If, for example, the answer is your phone, it could represent the ability to communicate with others. Your driving force might be socialising and community. Secondly: when was the last time you were incandescent with rage over something that, in the general scheme of things, didn’t matter that much? For instance, if someone pushed in front of you in a queue two weeks ago and you’re still having imaginary conversations with them in your bathroom mirror, your key value might be fairness. Once you’ve identified your driving force, it’s a case of making the task you’re dreading match your motivation. Let’s say you’re driven to make a difference. You could do a shout-out to see if anyone on your course is struggling with an aspect of studying or a particular module, and challenge yourself to explain it to them. You’re revising, but also helping others. If socialising is your thing, three or four of you could pledge to go over the material and present different parts of it to one another over Zoom or Skype. If you can make it entertaining, all the better. Competitive people are most enthused when in competition with themselves, so time yourself doing a past paper and then see if you can beat your own record. If you can get a competitive person into an online social study group they’ll also likely ensure you all remain on track. One day, lockdown will be over and we’ll be tasked with attempting to get back to “normal”, but it’s shrewd to remain aware of your driving force. After all, as a psychologist once told me: “Your key value is freedom. If you’re chained to the same desk for 12 hours a day you’ll never be happy, no matter how many zeros are on the end of your salary.” Natasha Devon is an author and campaigner who works in schools, colleges and universities throughout the UK.

195	They say one of the first signs of indoctrination is the inability to take into consideration any outside viewpoints. All news and information starts to be filtered through one ideological point of view, and the indoctrinated surround themselves only with people who share that point of view. I think, then, we can safely say that the media has been indoctrinated. Incapable of discussing the epidemic of loneliness and alienation that gets lumped in with “incel culture” (incel stands for “involuntary celibate”) it can only swing between hysterical condemnation – these young men are fighting a war against women – or soft-hearted (and -headed) pity: all these men need is a girlfriend and a better job. File the new film TFW No GF, which is named after a meme that refers to feeling alone (“that feel when no girlfriend”), under the soft-hearted side of things. The documentary, which was supposed to debut at the now canceled SXSW festival and was unveiled this week on Amazon Prime, is ostensibly a portrait of male loneliness and disenfranchisement in struggling post-industrial cities from the “forgotten” regions of America. It profiles several young men who have grown up with unfettered access to “gore and hardcore pornography” and notoriously rules-free message boards such as 4chan, which is routinely accused by experts of being a hotbed of alt-right radicalization and misogyny. The film also seeks to examine how the “privilege” of white manhood is pretty much a fantasy when separated from structures like wealth, higher education, and urban, coastal centers. The men are all white, un- or under-employed, and often grew up in difficult family circumstances. They spend a lot of time making inappropriate – but sometimes quite funny – jokes on social media. (My favorite: “Dear Isis, please execute every non-incel.”) At first viewing, TFW No GF seems like an empathetic, if not well structured or contextualized, view of a much maligned but probably pretty harmless group of guys. By harmless I mean that, for the most part, the alienated young men of America pose a greater threat to themselves – via suicide and addiction – than to others. Of course, when they do lash out at others, the results are sometimes horrifying acts of violence, often against women. One of the film’s producers is Cody Wilson, a self-defined “crypto-anarchist”. His various run-ins with the law include pleading guilty to endangering a child after being brought up on charges of paying a minor for sex and a legal battle with the feds after he released blueprints online for creating a firearm by 3D printer. Wilson is also one of the founders of Hatreon, a crowdsourcing platform favored by white nationalist groups kicked off Patreon for violating their terms regarding hate speech. So, yeah. Whatever his motivations for producing the film, it’s safe to say they are probably highly questionable. But should that mean we shouldn’t watch it? After the 2016 election, there was a lot of talk about intellectual “bubbles”. Given free rein to choose from the multitude of media sources, voices, and communities to listen to, we tend to go with those we already agree with, getting no outside perspective. But while the leftist bubble was deemed a problem because it left its inhabitants naive about what was happening in “Trump country”, only the more conservative bubble was deemed dangerous. On the right, terrorists and reactionaries were being created, but it’s not like they had anything those on the left needed to know. If anything, the left just needed to infiltrate, so it could “teach” and “help” those trapped on the right. But whatever the politics of these young men – the documentary’s makers largely omit politics from the conversation, framing the subjects as simply trolls and reflexive antagonists – they do offer some useful insights. The alienated generally do. Their observations on the way America presents itself as a meritocracy, yet saves its rewards for people with money, family connections, and good looks, are important. The memes and jokes and insults they create might not reach the level of Dostoevsky’s Notes from Underground, but they have some shared sensibility. The alienated young men of America deserve a better intermediary than a previous international fugitive. The director, Alex Lee Moyer, has described herself as “red-pilled”. The musician who wrote the score, Ariel Pink, has a long history of edge-lordy political comments – always carefully packaged in irony and plausible deniability. The greatest failing of the documentary is the way it pretends 4chan and other gathering places for this particular subculture are mostly harmless, perhaps populated with a few bad eggs. (By “bad egg”, I of course mean mass murderers.) One character in the documentary refers to boards where people say they’re going to kill themselves, either as a confession or as a joke, and other users will sometimes encourage the user to follow through. It’s funny, he tells us, except that “maybe” someone will be sincere and actually die. Except that’s not a maybe – one user actually livestreamed his suicide attempt for 4chan. If you want to talk about a subculture, talking about its dark sides and limitations in a serious way is more helpful than pretending everything is fine. But what if that is part of the film’s agenda? There is so much misinformation and heightened emotions – the kind that caused authorities across the country to go into high alert because of a comic-book movie – around this subculture that any real conversation about incels is nearly impossible. We’re always afraid of alienated figures, because of what they reveal about a society that works for some of us. These young men refuse to go through the motions of pretending the “meritocratic” American Dream isn’t rigged. That makes those of us with “merit” nervous. We’re afraid of what they might do instead.

196	My quest to retain some level of fitness during isolation is being repeatedly undermined by my appetite. The days feel 43 hours long, and I am endlessly bored. Just yesterday, I went through our treat cupboard and found a two-year-old packet of flying saucers nobody wanted. I hoovered them up as if I were auditioning for Oliver Twist. I cannot concentrate when we are watching television because I am internally debating which breakfast cereal I am going to have as a late-night snack, while also weighing up whether I can be bothered to go and get it. I don’t foresee these eating habits changing any time soon, which means it has become imperative that I maintain an exercise regime. I tried jogging, and almost immediately decided it is for people who hate themselves. Then my wife suggested we do a Zoom fitness class. A lot of us are unaware of the variety of people affected by this situation, and fitness instructors have been hit hard. I do want to take this opportunity to say that I don’t think they’re suffering the most, because we have entered a phase where expressing empathy for anyone risks somebody else calling you out (“So you don’t give a shit about the NHS workers or the elderly, you filth!”). But the point I am trying to make is that it felt good to support someone whose income has been decimated. Yes, I only paid a fiver, but it is now possible to accept a hero credit for the smallest things: I can say I am doing my bit for local businesses by ordering a Deliveroo, and last week I was proud of myself for using an instrument during the clap for the NHS. My wife and I signed into the class, and I was immediately struck by the fact that this was far more exposing than doing one IRL. Everyone could see everyone, right in front of them, rather than being in among them, and I found myself wishing we had thought more carefully about the framing of our shot. It’s difficult to look very committed when your backdrop features 11 pizza boxes. I became paranoid about how untidy our house looked compared to the others, and realised how naive we’d been: the real workout is getting yourself and that bit of your house ready. I selected “gallery view”, where you see everyone else in a grid. But for all I knew, the others stuck with the default view, which has the person speaking taking up the majority of the screen. This is fine in principle, except that it cuts to whoever makes any kind of noise. I muted us immediately, so that the screen didn’t cut to our house after an involuntary grunt or rogue fart. The class was exhausting, and it felt weird to be doing that level of exercise in our kitchen. I was ready to stop far sooner than anyone else, but felt embarrassed to be seen taking a breather; instead, I pretended to accidentally star jump out of frame. There was the added issue that I apparently look ridiculous when performing any physical activity. My wife claimed the biggest challenge for her was trying to keep a straight face during my burpees (an exercise that no level of physical improvement can make worthwhile). Despite all this, we will be doing it again. It is tough, and we have to tidy up beforehand, but last night I ate an entire Christmas pudding. Failure is not an option.
147	A Pakistani journalist living in exile in Sweden and who had been missing since March has been found dead in a river. Sajid Hussain, who was granted political asylum in Sweden in 2019 after fleeing Pakistan, had been missing since 2 March. He was last seen boarding a train to Uppsala, a city 35 miles (56km) north of Stockholm. “His body was found on 23 April in the Fyris river outside Uppsala,” Jonas Eronen, a police spokesman, said. Hussain had been living with a friend, Abdul Malik, in Stockholm when he went missing. Malik said Hussain had been in a good mood before leaving for Uppsala on 2 March. His wife, Shahnaz Baloch, said she had spoken to Hussain over the phone that morning and he had been in good spirits, discussing his plans to move to a new apartment in Uppsala. “We just want police to investigate the cause of death and give an answer to his family and friends,” said Malik. “We want to know what happened.” Hussain fled Pakistan in 2012 after his reporting on forced disappearances and human rights violations in the Balochistan region had resulted in the police raiding his house and interrogating his family. He also received death threats. Eronen said a crime could not be completely ruled out, but that Hussain’s death could equally have been an accident or suicide. “The autopsy has dispelled some of the suspicion that he was the victim of a crime,” he said. “As long as a crime cannot be excluded, there remains the risk that his death is linked to his work as a journalist,” said Erik Halkjaer, the head of the Swedish branch of Reporters without Borders (RSF). RSF said Hussain’s controversial profile meant it could not be ruled out that he had been abducted and killed “at the behest of a Pakistani intelligence agency”. The country’s foreign ministry declined to comment. Hussain had continued his journalism as chief editor of the Baluchistan Times, an online magazine he founded, from abroad. He wrote about drug trafficking, forced disappearances and a long-running insurgency. He had arrived in Sweden in 2018, after previously moving from the United Arab Emirates to Oman and Uganda. According to his family and friends, he was in the process of bringing his wife and two children to join him in Sweden, and had been due to start a post-graduate degree at the University of Uppsala. Pakistan is considered one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists, who are regularly harassed and killed. According to the 2019 RSF press freedom index, Pakistan ranked 142 out of 180 countries.
148	Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was accused of artificially inflating the number of coronavirus tests, as he hailed the rapid expansion that allowed him to reach a self-imposed 100,000-a-day target as a “national achievement”. It emerged that a third of the 122,347 tests included in the final 24-hour period before the deadline were counted before they had been carried out. Around 39,000 had been sent out to households and satellite testing locations, with no guarantee of the timescale for their completion, but were still included in the count. The figure marked a significant rise on Thursday’s total of 81,611 tests, and comfortably exceeded the 100,000 daily target. The latest figure of 122,000 tests were carried out on 73,000 people, with the remainder being retests. Hancock praised colleagues and private sector partners for the rapid increase in testing capability, which has seen mobile testing units and new labs created – and defended the target itself. “Setting stretching, ambitious goals in a national crisis has a galvanising effect on everyone involved,” he said. “I knew that it was an audacious goal but we needed an audacious goal,” he said. “I can announce that we have met our goal.” However, Hancock was criticised by his Labour shadow, Jon Ashworth. “Many would have expected the 100,000 promise to have been met by actually carrying out testing, not simply because 39,000 kits had been mailed out,” Ashworth said. “This headline figure shouldn’t count tests that hadn’t been used or indeed might never be used. Ministers promised us transparency, the public and NHS deserve clarity.” He also complained that the target was “never a strategy,” saying ministers should be using the lockdown period to “put the fundamentals of infectious disease control in place”. Earlier on Friday, the Health Service Journal (HSJ) claimed that, until recently, tests were only recorded in the daily count once they had been sent to a laboratory for analysis. The government denied there had been a change. An unnamed senior source told the HSJ that the change had been made because Hancock, the health and social care secretary, was “obsessed” with honouring his testing pledge. Last week, an online portal was launched allowing drive-through tests and home testing kits to be booked by symptomatic key workers and, later, over-65s, those needing to work outside the home, care home staff and residents. Hancock has come under intense pressure over the 100,000-a-day target since making it. At the time, the government was clear that the figure represented the number of people having a test. The current testing total used by ministers includes tens of thousands of retests. Recently, Hancock stressed that his aim was to have in place by the end of April the capacity to undertake 100,000 daily tests. According to the HSJ, Chris Wormald, the Department of Health’s permanent secretary, signed off what appeared to be a major and previously unannounced change to the way the headline daily number is calculated. Challenged about the HSJ story, Hancock said: “It’s not something I recognise.” The government’s testing tsar, John Newton, appearing alongside Hancock said: “There’s been no change to the way tests are counted. “That’s the way they are counted, have always been counted, and that’s the way we were advised to count them by officials.” However the numbers of home testing kits being mailed out was not included in figures before last week as the items were not available. The acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, said Hancock’s target “was always a hostage to fortune, and the truth is, he missed it”. He said it was disappointing the government had chosen to “massage the metrics” rather than admit failure as this would undermine public confidence. Despite the row about how the tests are accounted for, Hancock said the significantly increased capacity would allow the government to track the progress of the disease more accurately, and to control its spread, once lockdown restrictions are eased. Boris Johnson announced on Thursday that the government will set out next week a “road map” for reopening schools and businesses, once the government’s scientific advisers deem it safe to do so. This will include what he called a “menu of options”. The prime minister said the public were likely to be encouraged to wear masks, as part of the plan for easing restrictions: but his official spokesman insisted on Friday that no formal decision had been made. Johnson said at Thursday’s press conference: “I do think face masks will be useful, both for epidemiological reasons, and to give people the confidence that it is safe to go back to work.” But his spokesman said no final decision had yet been taken. “Ministers are still considering how we move forward with face coverings, in terms of the precise advice,” he said. “The advice we have received, based on the science, shows a weak but also positive effect in reducing transmission from … asymptomatic members of the public, where social distancing is not possible.” The lockdown restrictions imposed on 23 March are set to be reviewed by ministers next Thursday. Hancock announced that 27,510 people have now died from Covid-19: an increase of 739. The figures have risen significantly since the government began including deaths taking place in care homes, as well as those in hospitals. The health secretary reiterated the government’s determination to recruit 18,000 people to help track the progress of the disease by mid-May, as part of what he called a “full-scale test, track and trace model”. “If it needs to be bigger, we’ll scale it up as required,” he added. He also said the government will shortly release the app it has been trialling, which is aimed at identifying sufferers and warning those they have met. “People will be able to know if they’ve been in close contact with someone who’s transmitting the disease, and take action if they need to,” he said. The government has come under mounting pressure to explain why it didn’t build up the capacity to track the infection earlier – instead, halting the tracing of individual cases in March. The Conservative MP Greg Clark, who chairs the science and technology committee, wrote a testy public letter to Public Health England on Friday to urge it to publish more evidence about why that decision was made, after it declined to do so. “It is important that the bodies responsible for UK policy and practice are transparent about the basis of vital decisions,” he said. “It is disappointing that Public Health England has still not disclosed the assessment they made which led them to reject the South Korean approach to testing. “So I ask again for PHE to publish the evidence which informed UK testing strategy, without further delay.” The plea followed a hearing with PHE officials last month.
149	Showing a film in a cinema has become an act of political consequence. Movie theatres across the globe, from China to the US, have shut down during the coronavirus pandemic, and arguments have broken out, as much on ideological lines as economic, as to how and when to reopen. In Sweden, however, some have remained open all along, operating under new government guidelines. With 47 cinemas and about 200 screens, the country’s second-largest chain Svenska Bio stayed operational – and as a result has become Europe’s biggest operator by box office revenue. “Swedes, we’re born social distancing,” says Peter Fornstam, Svenska Bio’s founder and managing director. “I am happy that we kept the doors open and that we are still operating [but] I wish everyone was operating.” New rules mean no more than 50 people in the auditorium. By choice, Fornstam has halved theatrical occupancy. Hand sanitising, washing and social distancing is paramount. He has started a plan where the screen can be rented for gaming. There is also the Bio on Demand, which is cinema-on-demand on a real-life big screen. “You can choose your own movie and have your own screen with your friends,” says Fornstam. “The proof is in the pudding. We have had a fair amount of [customers].” Fornstam has been both lauded and reviled for keeping his cinemas open – even more since the biggest cinema chain in Sweden, Filmstaden, closed theirs. The 65-year-old takes a long view. “Swedes … there used to be a joke that if every Swede were told to have a blue and a yellow sock, nobody would question the decision but they would question if the colour of the sock could cause cancer,” he says. “The government said we should do this. So we’ll do this. We can stick to the rules. Also, there are physical and mental issues to deal with, so we try to keep everyone going.” Forstam’s position is in keeping with Sweden’s more liberal response to the pandemic. While its neighbours Denmark, Finland and Norway went into various versions of lockdown, Sweden closed high schools and universities but allowed kindergartens and primaries to remain open. Theatres, museums and sporting arenas were closed, restaurants remained open. The government said that if social distancing rules are not followed, offending businesses would be shut down. The country has faced heavy criticism from scientists as it recorded a far higher death rate than its neighbours, with Sten Linnarsson, a professor at Sweden’s Karolinska Institute, saying that “there is a lack of scientific evidence being put forward for these policies”. However, the Swedish model has been hailed by conservatives in the US – without understanding, according Lars Trägårdh, a history professor at Ersta Sköndal Bräcke University College, that it depends on the population’s compliance with, and trust in, the state. “It is interesting to see that the Swedish stress on what we call ‘freedom under responsibility’ is getting picked up by the libertarian right in the US. The big problem with all of that is that Sweden is all built, ultimately, on a very strong alliance between the state and the individual.” Swedes, in effect, follow the recommendations of authorities. Swedish-American journalist Erik Augustin Palm went even further in an article in Slate, citing Sweden’s peculiar cultural attributes such as “unbounded trust in state experts and an internalised sense of exceptionalism” as contributing factors to the belief that the government knows what it’s doing. “It is still possible that Sweden’s Covid-19 response could be exonerated – say, herd immunity does take effect and Sweden’s death rate is lower than neighbouring countries’ at some point … This seems highly unlikely, but still possible.” In the meantime, Fornstam is waiting on that start of movement further up the movie supply chain, which seems to be focusing around the projected July release of Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s time-travel epic. He remains convinced that the anticipation of a major big-screen spectacle is proof that cinema – like live music or sports – can be a unique experience. “Some people say this is the kiss of death for the cinema, especially in corona times. I think it is the other way around,” he says. “It is so funny that [the idea] of ‘rent your own cinema’ has been so successful for us – that shows the strength of going to the movies rather than watching a movie at home. I pray and hope that on 17 July this year, Chris Nolan will be there for us.”
150	Labour’s new leader, Sir Keir Starmer, gave members of his fresh frontbench team some gentle advice when he began chairing shadow cabinet meetings by videoconference last month: you don’t have to speak for the sake of it. While Jeremy Corbyn’s consensual chairing style involved hearing lengthy contributions from colleagues with contrasting views, Starmer reminds shadow ministers they shouldn’t feel obliged to chip in. With the nation gripped by the Covid-19 crisis, he has taken an equally restrained approach to Labour’s contribution to the national debate – to varying reviews from those on his own side. “Our pragmatic decision is, first of all to engage on the practical things the government could do that would make people’s lives easier,” says Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow work and pensions secretary. “In my area for instance, that’s uprating legacy benefits and ending the benefit cap and the two-child limit in universal credit – rather than saying, ‘Let’s have a universal basic income [UBI]’, or ‘Let’s have a minimum income guarantee.’” But while his supporters have applauded Starmer’s approach and argued that a more aggressive line will simply alienate the public at a time of high government popularity, Labour leftwingers have been frustrated at the party’s refusal to seize on the crisis as a moment to propose a radical overhaul of the economy and society. Jon Trickett, now relegated to the backbenches from his position of shadow cabinet office minister, says: “The country’s crying out for a longer-term vision. We need to map out a great vision for the kind of new normal that can exist after this pandemic. Perhaps the leadership doesn’t feel now’s the right time to do that.” Reynolds says those are arguments Labour can make later. For now, the priority is pressing for urgent assistance for struggling households and families. “I’m very sympathetic to UBI, but realistically you’ve got to use the channels we’ve got,” he says. “The fact that we have come out with pragmatic suggestions of how to help people right now, does not take away from the fact that we want and are committed to a full alternative to universal credit: we want to work with people and build a big coalition around that. That approach has been replicated across the shadow cabinet. Annaliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, has praised the chancellor’s economic rescue schemes but pointed out the gaps in them. And Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, has lauded frontline police officers but demanded more action to protect domestic violence victims. Labour believes this is what the public expects of the official opposition at a time of national crisis. Starmer held the first two of a string of planned “Call Keir” virtual meetings, with voters from Bury and the Tees Valley this week. These meetings, and polling seen by Labour strategists, are telling them the public don’t want to hear knee-jerk criticism of the government. “The approach we’re getting from the public is, ‘All of us need to be together, getting through this,’” said a party source. They also say the public believe the right time to challenge the government’s handling of the outbreak head-on will be after the worst has passed – though Starmer has stepped up his attacks in the past week, telling Johnson the UK had been slow into lockdown, and now risks “falling behind the rest of the world”. The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth – one of the few frontbenchers to remain in the same job when Starmer took over – has been praised by Matt Hancock for his constructive approach; but his frustration with the government’s stance also appeared to bubble over this week. Ashworth has been calling for the test-and-track approach now being pursued by Hancock for some time – and believes the health secretary should have started much earlier to recruit the necessary army of contact-tracers he has now acknowledged will be needed. “This lockdown is not a strategy in itself to defeat the virus,” Ashworth told the Guardian. “This lockdown buys us time to put in place a strategy. And my big fear is that in the same way they failed to prepare the testing we needed, and they failed to prepare the PPE for frontline staff, it looks like they are failing to prepare the tracing capacity we need.” Most of Starmer’s frontbench team have been in contact with their Conservative opposite numbers, and the shadow cabinet are receiving briefings from relevant civil servants. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow education secretary, says that while they don’t want to “bombard” the civil service, “it’s our job as an opposition to be constructively critical”. And Reynolds says these private conversations are no substitute for asking a question publicly, in parliament – even virtually. Boris Johnson briefed Starmer directly this week, as part of what the prime minister claimed was part his effort to “build the biggest possible consensus,” for how to manage the next phase of the crisis. Both sides insist that falls far short of coopting Labour into decision-making, however, with Starmer’s team regarding chatter about a “national government” as a Westminster bubble fantasy.﻿ When Johnson returned to the Downing Street press conference on Thursday, he appeared to reflect Labour’s repeated recent calls for an “exit strategy”, avoiding the phrase repeatedly used by Starmer but promising a “road map” and a “menu of options”. Speaking afterwards, Starmer made clear he felt vindicated. “I think that shows that we were right to challenge on it, and I’m pleased that we’re going to see a plan, we’ll look at it when we see it, but it’s a step in the right direction.” With Corbyn watching from high above him on the backbenches, Starmer used a telling phrase at Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions, to describe how he sees his own approach – and which helps explain his caution. “I try to be careful to stick to the data and the evidence, rather than just coming up with an opinion,” he told Dominic Raab.
151	McDonald’s has announced it will reopen some of its UK restaurants in mid-May, and will take the temperature of every employee using contactless thermometers at start of each shift. The company will reopen 15 of its 1,270 restaurants on 13 May, initially only for delivery orders. They will be staffed by smaller teams than usual, and will offer a limited menu. The locations will be revealed next week. McDonald’s joins a group of fast food companies, including rivals Nando’s and Burger King, to start phased reopenings while the lockdown continues. The chain’s UK and Ireland chief executive, Paul Pomroy, said the company had trialled the new safety measures after almost two months’ closure, but added that service would not be same as before. “When we return it will be different as we all adjust to this new normal. I want to apologise in advance if our first wave of reopened restaurants does not serve your area,” Pomroy said. The company’s 120,000 UK employees will be asked to confirm they are fit and able to work before returning, and will have their temperature checked on arrival at work. They will be provided with protective equipment including non-medical-grade face masks. Every branch will be deep-cleaned before it reopens, with Perspex screens installed along with floor markings to indicate safe physical distancing. Staff and delivery workers will be asked to practise distancing. Restaurants and pubs were included in the government shutdown measures, but they are allowed to prepare food in their kitchens for collection or delivery.
152	Stephen Colbert On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert capped another bizarre and frustrating week of Donald Trump “royally shanking his coronavirus press conferences” with an assessment of his latest strategy: inviting individual governors to the Oval Office. On Thursday, the president met with New Jersey’s governor, Phil Murphy, for a press call in which he latched on to an analogy Murphy used for coronavirus shock: “As Mike Tyson said, everyone has a plan until you get punched in the face.” “It makes sense that Trump would relate to Mike Tyson,” said Colbert. “They’re both 80s pop culture icons with horrible histories with women who need no excuse to eat a human ear.” As for the rest of his press conferences this week, in which the president threw around words rather than guidelines, it seems “Trump doesn’t talk like a guy who knows what he’s talking about”, said Colbert. Colbert admired in particular Trump’s gall to say the US will somehow be rid of the virus because it will “disappear” with or without a vaccine – “If you don’t have a vaccine and the virus is gone, we’re like we were before,” Trump said. “Oh, where we were before, good!” Colbert deadpanned. “So instead of being in a global pandemic, we’ll go back to being completely unprepared for a global pandemic.” “Here’s the thing: Trump doesn’t want everything to go back to normal because we’re ready for it to go back to normal,” Colbert concluded. “He wants everything to go back to normal because he’s bored.” Indeed, Trump told reporters this week that he’s been in the White House for months and would “like to get out”. “Mr President, we would all like to get you out of the White House,” Colbert responded. Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers reacted to a truly galling BuzzFeed News report that New York state, on the direct recommendation of the White House coronavirus taskforce, paid $69.1m to a mobile-phone engineer in California who simply tweeted at Trump that he could supply ventilators. That’s three times the retail price of high-end ventilators to someone without medical device experience; not a single ventilator has been delivered on the contract. “This is insane,” said Meyers. “I mean, we’re talking about a guy who’s the most powerful person on Earth – there’s literally a law that allows him to compel companies to make ventilators – and he’s combing through his Twitter replies like he’s putting a band together – ‘Oh, this guy’s got an amp … well, that could come in really handy.’” Meyers also rebuffed Trump’s repeated claims this week that no one could have seen a pandemic coming, or that the White House has handled coronavirus well. “Trump had the chance to act early, to prevent both the public health crisis and the economic one, and instead he chose to ignore and downplay the threat,” Meyers said. And part of that failure is Trump’s “spectral son-in-law” Jared Kushner, who on Wednesday told Fox and Friends that the government’s response to the virus was a “great success story”. “A great success story? You’re not even a great success story,” Meyers retorted. “You’re only in the White House because Ivanka lost Tom Brady’s phone number in one of her sweatshop handbags. You shouldn’t be anywhere near the White House; you should be confessing to Christopher Meloni at the end of an episode of Law &amp; Order.” “Seriously, we have one million cases, 60,000 deaths and 30 million out of work,” Meyers continued. “If this is a success, what would failure look like? The Statue of Liberty getting laid off and developing a weed habit in quarantine?” Trevor Noah Trevor Noah also discussed the insane story of the ventilator contract via random tweet on Thursday’s Daily Social Distancing Show. “First of all, if someone tells you the price of anything is $69m, it’s a joke – 69 is pranking 101,” Noah said. “And second, of all, nice.” Noah had to backtrack and repeat the story just to process it: “Some random guy tweeted President Trump asking him for a ventilator contract, and … his wish was just granted? Just like that? He said, ‘I want this thing,’ and then he got the thing?” “I mean, let this be a warning,” Noah concluded. “The next time you tweet at the president telling him that you’ve got Hillary’s emails and deez nuts? Don’t be shocked if Trump shows up to collect.” Jimmy Kimmel And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel again poked at our “hungry hungry hippo-crite” in chief, who spent the week “saying everything is great while simultaneously blaming everyone who isn’t him for why it’s all so terrible”. Trump has been complaining that his administration inherited bad tests, “which makes no sense”, said Kimmel. “No 1, you can’t have a test for a virus before a virus exists, and No 2, he’s in no position to be complaining about inheriting anything. If it wasn’t for inheritance, he would be the doorman outside one of the buildings his father gave him.” But if he’s not moved by coronavirus and increasing unemployment, Trump gets heated about bad poll; he was reportedly so upset by his poll numbers vis-a-vis Joe Biden in swing states last week that he threatened to sue his campaign manager. Clearly, his campaign is “running like a well-turmoiled machine”, said Kimmel. And on Wednesday, Trump dismissed the polls outright, telling Reuters: “I don’t believe the polls. I believe the people of this country are smart. And I don’t think they’ll put a man in who’s incompetent.” “We did it last time, why wouldn’t we do it again?” Kimmel responded.
153	IVF clinics are set to reopen in May, after the fertility regulator said it was lifting its suspension of all fertility services due to the coronavirus outbreak. The move will come as welcome news to people who were forced to put their IVF treatment on hold during the crisis. Clinics across the UK can apply to reopen from 11 May, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has confirmed, if they ensure the safety and protection of staff and patients. Both private and NHS clinics will be required to show they are able to provide safe treatment during the outbreak before they are given the green light to restart. Physical distancing must be observed in waiting rooms, telephone appointments should be used when suitable and personal protective equipment used when necessary. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: “Now that we are past the peak, I am delighted to announce the restoration of fertility services. “People who are relying on fertility treatment have been worried during these unprecedented times not knowing when they could continue their journey to start a family. “We wanted to open these clinics as soon as it was safe to do so, and our strict guidelines will ensure staff and patients remain safe as we continue to tackle this virus.” HFEA, which regulates Britain’s fertility industry, ordered both NHS and private clinics to suspend treatment for those undergoing IVF from 15 April. Prior to this, all new IVF treatment was banned. The news caused heartache for many women desperately trying to conceive, with many fearing they could miss their chance by the time the restrictions were lifted. Data from the HFEA showed that more than 54,000 patients underwent 75,000 fertility treatments in 2017, resulting in 20,500 births. Sally Cheshire, the HFEA chair, said: “Our priority throughout the pandemic has been to consider how treatment could resume quickly and safely for as many patients as possible and our clear plan sets out how clinics can treat and care for patients safely during the continuing Covid-19 pandemic. “I know that the closure of clinics has been extremely distressing for patients and this will be good news for those wanting to resume treatment and have the opportunity to try for their much longed for family.”
154	Your article on the language of Boris Johnson’s speech (‘Invisible mugger’: how Boris Johnson’s language hints at his thinking, 27 April) examines the use of metaphors during this crisis. Equally important is the very use of vocabulary. One of the most popular words of the moment is “unprecedented”, increasingly used by politicians as if it meant “unpredicted”. This crisis was both predictable and predicted, as your reporting makes clear. But to imply that this pandemic was unpredictable and unpredicted relieves politicians of culpability. Other linguistic constructions have all the appearance of the beginnings of a blame game; in particular “we are following the science”. To think there is some single and undisputed body of knowledge and method called “the science” is plain wrong. But if politicians can maintain the fiction that there is something called “the science” and they simply follow it, then how can they be blamed? As you say, vocabulary and metaphors are not neutral constructs. Adrian Darnell Durham • The constant use of war analogies is enabling ministers to treat the public as if they were unable to grasp the risks attached to particular strategies. Talking about the coronavirus as “the enemy” allows the government to keep its strategy, if it has one, secret. The difference is that the virus is not like a wartime enemy; it is not listening, nor will it alter its behaviour if our strategy is publicly known. There are no spies feeding the information to the virus. The arrogance of ministers at the daily briefing, repeating over and over that they are taking “the right decisions at the right time”, suggests an omnipotence that they surely do not have. History will decide whether the decisions were the right ones. Right now it seems the government has no more idea what to do than anyone else, and that is why it trots out platitudes. Are they reassuring the public or themselves? Morag Watkins Bovingdon, Hertfordshire • I am starting a one-man campaign to eradicate the spread of the “ramping up” virus, which seems to be afflicting politicians, journalists, and anyone who comments on the Covid-19 pandemic. I yell at the radio every time Matt Hancock talks about “ramping up coronavirus testing”, which he does several times during the “Hancock’s Half Hour” briefing at 5pm. Why has he abandoned the perfectly adequate verb “increase”? Could we start, please, with an instruction to all Guardian journalists to call out politicians who use the phrase? They themselves should pay a £100 penalty into a “ramping up” box each time they use it in an article. Proceeds, of course, to the NHS or social care, according to the editor’s choice. John Speed Luxembourg • I congratulate the Guardian for using the term “physical distancing” rather than the misnomer “social distancing”. Physical distancing actually enables some social contact. It helps us to visit and support those who are self-isolating. It has allowed me to sing with my neighbours: for the NHS on Thursday evenings and to celebrate May Day on 1 May: the first time in 400 years that May Day has not been celebrated with singing from the top of Magdalen Tower in Oxford. Dr Hazel Dawe Oxford • “I am ashamed of sending colleagues into mortal risk on my behalf” says Dr Alan Willson (Letters, 27 April). So should we all be, particularly the government. There is an old Dutch phrase, “verloren hoop” which meant “lost heap” and referred to the soldiers who were put in the frontline of a battle in the certainty that they would die. Without PPE and all the protective gear, some of our caring staff have been treated like that “lost heap”. The phrase later became “forlorn hope” in modern English. which has quite a different meaning – our marvellous NHS has not been a forlorn hope, but “a very present help in trouble”, and we thank them from the bottom of our hearts.

155	A prominent Nigerian humanist accused of blasphemy has been arrested and taken to the northern city of Kano, according to figures close to him. Mubarak Bala, the president of the Humanist Association of Nigeria, was taken from his home on 28 April in neighbouring Kaduna state and taken to Kano, where a warrant for his arrest was issued, Leo Igwe, a fellow Nigerian humanist and human rights advocate, said. “We condemn his arrest and are extremely worried because this came after several threats made by the religious community in Kano,” Igwe said. “They are likely to try him under sharia law in Kano, which could lead to capital punishment.” Sharia law is applied in 12 states across the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, including Kano where blasphemy is punishable by death. Igwe said police had denied Bala access to a lawyer and had not said what the charges were, heightening fears for his safety. “Our worst fear is that he would be taken to Kano because there are many figures who have been threatening him and promising to end his life,” Igwe said. “The Kano police told me he was in their custody, but for days now they haven’t given us any more information.” Police in Kano would not confirm whether they were holding Bala. In a statement, Humanist UK, the leading British humanist society, said: “We condemn in the strongest terms the arrest of our humanist colleague Mubarak Bala by the Nigerian authorities, who have accused him of ‘blasphemy’, which can carry the death penalty.” Nigeria is a deeply religious country, mainly Christian in the south and largely Muslim in the north. Bala, the son of a widely regarded Islamic scholar, has been an outspoken religious critic in a staunchly conservative region, where open religious dissent is uncommon. After renouncing Islam in 2014, he was forcibly committed to a psychiatric facility by his family in Kano before being discharged. After Bala posted comments critical of Islam and religion on his Facebook profile recently he had received a surge of online accusations of blasphemy and threats, Igwe said, largely from figures in Kano. On Facebook on Monday, Bala said that after recent threats he would resort to more mildly critical posts and humour. Igwe said Bala had helped create a community for thousands of atheists, particularly in northern Nigeria. “To speak out and say you’re an atheist or humanist in Nigeria can be dangerous, but Bala is very passionate about creating a space for those who do not subscribe to Islam or religion,” he said.
156	How wonderful in these strange times to be transported back to the summer of 1947 by Andy Bull in his article on the Test series of that year (Compton’s summer of ’47 is the kind of succour the nation needs now, 28 April). I was a nine-year-old Lancastrian living in Rochdale with my Yorkshire-born father. Of course, my first Test match could not be at nearby Old Trafford, home of Dad’s hated Lancashire, so we journeyed each day in late July by bus across the Pennines, to reach the sacred Headingley, to see England beat South Africa by 10 wickets on the third day. Andy Bull rightly celebrates the achievement that summer of Denis Compton, but how appropriate that the heroes at Headingley were Len Hutton of Yorkshire and Cyril Washbrook of Lancashire, with 100 and 75 respectively in the first innings, and both undefeated at the crease in the second, when Hutton won the match with a six over square leg. Dean Hawkes Cambridge • I was at Lord’s in 1947 to see Denis Compton’s double century against South Africa in the second Test. His swagger to the wicket, his fearlessness and his sweep on one knee were a delight to behold for their novelty and courage. His partner through much of this was Bill Edrich, who was equally brave and also made over 3,000 runs in a season. It appeared that all the formally dressed adults at Lord’s that day were quite prepared to see Compton through the eyes of a small boy who was enhanced by bravery and audacity. Heroes were in short supply in 1947. Dr David Lyon Chesterfield, Derbyshire • In 1947, when I was 14, Compton and Edrich thrilled me from the sports section of Dad’s four-page Daily Express. It had seemed always full of food rationing and Russia. Who’d have thought the two cricketers would bring the same delight now to my 64-page Guardian? It seems always full of PPE rationing and Covid-19.

217	Intu Properties has said it is ready to take “robust action” against large tenants who have failed to pay rent owed during the coronavirus crisis. The owner of the Trafford Centre in Manchester and Lakeside in Essex said it had collected 40% of the rent due by the end of March, up from 29% collected on the due date, and some tenants were refusing to enter talks to find a solution to unpaid bills. Intu said: “There are a very small number of cases where customers are not currently engaging with us to find a consensual solution – these are large, well-capitalised brands who have the ability to pay but have chosen not to. In these instances we are prepared to take more robust action to enforce the legally binding terms of those leases.” The company said it would consider legal action including sending statutory demands, a formal request for payment or winding-up petitions – a legal notice usually sent by a creditor to request that the courts close a company that owes it money – to the one or two tenants who were refusing to pay. The government has banned commercial property landlords from taking legal action against tenants who have not paid their rent until 30 June, to protect retailers and other businesses during the coronavirus crisis. However, the government has asked high-street retailers and other companies to “pay what they can” to their landlords, and Intu believes a couple of retailers are taking advantage of this situation. The shopping centre owner is offering monthly rather than quarterly rent payments until the end of the year and has reduced its service charges, and it said it was negotiating rent payment plans with some tenants. The indebted company also used the update to investors to announce it had agreed waivers with some of its lenders to prevent potential breaches as it struggles with plummeting rental income. Intu warned in late March it would breach the terms on its debt commitments after a collapse in retail rents. Colm Lauder, a property analyst at the investment bank Goodbody, said the debt waivers would give Intu some breathing space. “While the waivers don’t give Intu much flexibility – lasting until June – they only pose weekly battles for the firm rather posing a long-term hurdle. This also signals a good likelihood that other retail landlords will benefit from covenants waivers,” he said. ﻿ Intu said all of its centres were operating on a “semi-closed basis” with only essential retailers remaining open. It has furloughed about 60% of its shopping centre staff and 20% at its head office. The company has appointed a chief restructuring officer to help as it “works through its strategy to fix the balance sheet”. David Hargrave was previously a partner in the restructuring practices of the big-four accountancy firms PwC and EY. Intu has been struggling for some time with its £4.5bn debt pile, and posted a loss of £2bn for 2019. Its share price has fallen by more than 90% over the past 12 months. Even before the coronavirus crisis began, the company had been hit by a spate of retailers closing stores and restructuring, and had been forced to write down the value of its centres by nearly £2bn. The company cancelled its emergency cash call at the start of March because of “extreme” market conditions as Covid-19 spread around the world. It had aimed to raise at least £1.3bn from investors.
218	‘You’d better unpack.” I was outside my home in Berlin in my car. I had just loaded it up and strapped the kids into their seats when my manager called. It was 11 March. The day before, I had completed a tour of Germany, performing 14 concerts in 10 days. The first news about Covid-19 was starting to seep through, but the concert halls were still open and, as a violinist and music director of the Zurich Chamber Orchestra, I had been playing for 2,000 people every night. At the signing sessions afterwards, the promoters had put up large signs requesting that the audience keep their distance and refrain from selfies (which they didn’t). Next up, I was due to perform at a festival on the beautiful island of Rügen in the Baltic Sea. Artists were flying in from all around the world, and I had decided to take the family along. Everything was looking fine, when suddenly the bubble burst. As my manager was calling to explain, local authorities on Rügen had announced that all events were to be cancelled with immediate effect. And then began the series of knock-on legislation and further cancellations. Soon I – like musicians around the world – was staring down the barrel of a destitute season. My kids were probably more upset than I was, at least initially. “What about the beach, Dad? You mean we can’t swim in the sea?” A week later I was starting to grow a beard and my wife was seriously wondering when I’d go back on the road and stop driving her round the bend. We binged on Netflix and Ben &amp; Jerry’s: my beautiful boys goggled at me with a mixture of love and increasing bewilderment as I read to them every night. “When is Dad leaving again?” they wondered – I am constantly on the road and they are used to my frequent long absences. Online, I saw my esteemed colleagues performing from their gardens, their balconies, their kitchens. At first I was hooked. What a wonderful idea: the dissemination of music at a ghastly time in our troubled world. But I started to wonder about the sound quality. Of course, a cell phone is a cell phone. But isn’t classical music all about sound, about really listening? All my Russian fiddle teachers certainly thought so: make a beautiful sound and you’ll be OK, they told me when I was a boy. Was it possible to produce a stream from home that would sound like it was in a concert hall? The next morning, I called Tobias Lehmann, a giant in the world of sound engineering who co-owns Berlin’s Teldex Studios. An hour later he was standing in my living room, taking measurements. “I think we can make it work,” he chirped. Next I called Wolfgang Bergmann, the head of the German section of Arte, a magnificent Franco-German television channel that lives and breathes culture as a public broadcaster. He and I had discussed many broadcasting ideas in the past. Would I be interested in a livestream? he asked. “Only if it is with top-notch sound,” I replied. “Can you start tomorrow?” he asked. I told him he was mad, and he said yes, but that I was even madder. He sent over two creative directors who within hours built a set in my living room, brought in beautiful art nouveau lighting to match the existing decor, and worked out how to turn our idea into reality. At this point we were still allowed to move freely and the production company still had permission to film, so long as we all kept at least 1.5m apart. We set up two unmanned cameras in addition to the cameraman in the room, thereby limiting how many people were actually in the space at a given time. Fortunately my living room is a fairly large open space which has separate rooms connecting to it. All the editing was done remotely, and the sound team we put in the basement. With a little remote instruction I was able to move the microphones around myself. I call it DIY television. What I needed next was a brilliant pianist who was also an arranger and at the same time able to improvise. Christoph Israel, whom I’ve known for years, fitted the bill perfectly. He had just written the music for an Agatha Christie production, which had also been cancelled, so he was sitting at home like everyone else, staring at the ceiling. I assembled an enormous list of pieces, he added more, and we spent three hours playing it all through. I don’t think any of us imagined just how much repertoire we would be going through night after night, with barely any rehearsal time. “What about some guests?” Wolfgang inquired casually after the first episode. Luckily I live in one of the world’s most musical cities. I started to call people up. They all said the same: “Nothing in the diary, of course we’ll come. Pick a day.” Simon Rattle skipped merrily up my front steps: “Nice to finally meet you, AND play with you.” Robert Wilson was in lockdown around the corner. “May I write some text for you – you play and I’ll talk?” he offered. Director Barrie Kosky popped over to read Joseph Roth, Vladimir Jurowski and I played Schnittke, and Matthias Goerne sang Brahms. I paired Korngold’s music with Stefan Zweig and Manuel de Falla’s with Rudyard Kipling, and played jazz with Gwilym Simcock on world jazz day. There was no script nor a producer telling me what to say or play. We just went straight in and improvised and learned as we went along. In an early show I did a live Zoom call to one of the city’s leading paediatricians – I was both concerned and interested to learn how children could be affected by the virus. But as fascinating as it was, we soon realised that people wanted less “reality”, so instead I asked people to send in videos of their own homemade music-making. We’ve had literally hundreds to date, and I try and show one every night. I could never have imagined in my wildest dreams that such an eclectic bevy of artists would pass through my Berlin salon, nor that we would resurrect the age-old art of the house concert. That Hope@Home has attracted nearly 2 million streams is nothing short of a miracle. People are watching from all over the world – Europe, Russia, China, North America, Japan, India, South Africa, Australia, Argentina. Many have offered to make donations to charities helping freelance musicians – I made a feature of this early on and encouraged viewers to help artists affected by the current shutdown. Until now, I had spent the vast majority of my time on the road in order to communicate with my audience, while using the internet to stay in touch with my family. Now the tables have turned: in these six weeks I’ve been spending time at home, and in the evening, I merely pop downstairs to share my music with a global audience. As the shutdown continued, Arte extended the show three times. Now, as we approach 34 episodes, five “best ofs” and a TV special, I’ve decided, with a somewhat heavy heart, to close this lockdown chapter. It’s been a privilege and a thrill. I’ve not felt this artistically free in years, but for now, we need our living room back. So I guess I’ll work on that beard, and take my boys to the park. • Hope@Home streams live at 5pm BST/6pm CET on Arte (and via Facebook live) and is available on demand for 90 days after broadcast. The final show on Sunday 3 May features the world premiere of Max Richter’s Quarantine Recomposed
157	Defending the delay in imposing the lockdown, Boris Johnson claimed: “I think it was completely right to make our period of lockdown coincide … with the peak of the epidemic” (Johnson promises plan next week for return to schools and work, 30 April). Is he really not aware that it was the timing of the lockdown that determined the timing of the peak, not the other way around? Had the lockdown started sooner, the peak would have occurred sooner, fewer people would have been infected, fewer people would have died, and restrictions could have been eased more quickly. If the prime minister doesn’t understand this elementary principle, he should not be entrusted with making decisions upon which our lives depend. Robert Saunders Balcombe, West Sussex • How does Boris Johnson dare claim that we are “past the peak” of this epidemic? Johns Hopkins University says the number of new Covid-19 cases in the UK in the last five days was 4,695, 4,642, 4,597, 4,543 and 4,748. Doesn’t look like we are past the peak to me!

158	Your editorial (The Guardian view on Covid-19 and care homes: promises are not enough, 28 April) is incomplete. As with almost everything else I’ve read about Covid-19, one group has been ignored. When will someone notice the thousands of care workers, mainly women, who continue to visit and look after people living in their own homes? They are exposed to as many, if not more, risks of infection and seem to be at the end of the line when PPE is provided, yet are getting little, if any, recognition. And what about the district nurses? Jennifer Hewitt Wendover, Buckinghamshire • Joel Golby’s comparison of Covid-19 with the Black Death (Opinion, theguardian.com, 27 April) seems a little facile. The Black Death killed 30-60% of Europe’s population, affecting all age groups similarly. Covid-19 appears to kill 0.2-0.8% of the people it infects, the great majority towards the end of their lives. This is not sufficient to create the boom in graveyards he imagines.

159	Strengthening environmental regulations must be a key plank of the UK’s recovery from the coronavirus crisis to help prevent the spread of future pandemics, say a cross-party group of MPs – and bailouts for industries must contain strict conditions on their future environmental performance. The expansion of intensive farming, mining and infrastructure around the world has contributed to diseases spreading from wildlife to people, scientists say. The 26 MPs want the government to learn this lesson and encourage better agriculture, help developing countries to halt deforestation, and provide funding for poor countries to improve their health systems. In a letter organised by Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, they ask the chancellor to provide funding, and to recognise in his economic recovery plans that human health is dependant on that of animals, plants and the environment, and to reform the financial system to protect nature. Lucas said: “For too long, governments have ignored the link between the emergence of disease and climate change or biodiversity loss, failing to recognise that human health depends on the health of animals, plants and our shared environment too. If our economic system continues to push the natural world to destruction and fuel the climate emergency, we will become ever more vulnerable to future pandemics.” The MPs are asking for environmental regulations to be strengthened and enforced, and any economic support for industries such as aviation and intensive agriculture to be conditional on environmental sustainability commitments. They also call for better funding of healthcare, and an approach to economic decision-making that takes into account health and environmental concerns, including the full costs and consequences of policies for people and nature. Their letter follows a warning last month by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity, which said recent pandemics were the direct consequence of human activity. The scientists warned: “Future pandemics are likely to happen more frequently, spread more rapidly, have greater economic impact and kill more people if we are not extremely careful about the possible impacts of the choices we make today.” The MPs said systems that prized economic growth above other considerations would fail to take into account the need to protect the natural environment. Lucas said: “You can’t negotiate with a pandemic. If we’re to avoid the worst in future, rebuilding our economies in the wake of Covid-19 must be on the basis of development that respects the Earth’s natural limits and recognises our own need for a healthy natural environment.” She criticised the decision to bail out easyJet, saying that unconditional aid for industries that fuelled deforestation, destroyed natural habitats or harmed the climate would lead to problems. The 26 signatories included Sir Edward Davey, acting co-leader of the Liberal Democrats; Plaid Cymru’s Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts; the SNP; and seven Labour MPs, including Clive Lewis. No Conservative MPs have signed the letter.
160	Boris Johnson has told regional leaders to encourage people to commute on foot or by bike to help avoid a dramatic increase in car use when lockdown restrictions are partially lifted. The prime minister spoke on Friday afternoon to the “M9” – the group of mayors covering areas including Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire and North Tyneside – to hear their concerns and outline the government’s latest position. It is the first time Johnson has spoken directly to regional leaders since the beginning of the pandemic. London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, is the only mayor to have attended the emergency Cobra committee meetings. Greater Manchester’s mayor, Andy Burnham, has raised concerns previously about the lack of contact between central government and regional leaders, and called for more involvement and inclusion in crucial meetings. Johnson used his call to emphasise the mayors’ importance in the next phase of the response, and to update them on the government’s strategy. Jamie Driscoll, the Labour mayor for the North of Tyne, said Johnson and the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, seemed particularly keen to get people out of their cars when the lockdown is lifted. “It was very interesting that the prime minister was talking about taking the opportunity to push clean, green travel, active travel, cycling infrastructure and getting cars off the road,” Driscoll said. “The real risk is that you end up with a situation where people go back to work in their cars, into city centres that are not designed to take that amount of traffic, that congestion makes it harder for buses to get through and you end up with this vicious cycle. “We will be coming out of a crisis involving a virus that makes it very difficult for people to breathe. The last thing we need is a man-made equivalent.” Driscoll said Johnson made the link between green travel and reducing obesity. “Obesity is a massive issue and also a very expensive issue, because it does cause a lot of us, as we get older, to spend many years when we can’t be that active. It’s just speculation, and far be it from me to comment on the prime minister’s physique, but maybe having just been through it he has had a Damascene conversion.” The mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, said the message from the mayors was that all regions stand ready to play a full role in the recovery. “The point is that we have got the capabilities and structures to lead our economies through this because the country works as a big set of regional economies,” he said. “The prime minister fully accepted that point and he gave his utter commitment to continuing the principles of levelling up and devolution as part of the way we lead our way through this recovery.” The mayor of the Sheffield city region, Dan Jarvis, welcomedJohnson’s commitment to work closely with mayors. “We must build on these constructive discussions to ensure mayors have a strong mandate to transform our economy and society,” he said. “We must seize the opportunity to build a better Britain – not just recovery, but renewal. I will be working with the government and fellow mayors to deliver for our communities. It is needed now more than ever.”
161	Just after 7.30 on Friday morning, the arrivals hall at London Luton Airport burst into life following a 10-day shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. More than 100 passengers arrived on Wizz Air flight W6 4301 from the Bulgarian capital of Sofia, on the airline’s first scheduled commercial flight since the crisis. Most of those arriving were seasonal farm workers on their way to fruit and vegetable farms across the UK. Others said they had come to work on building sites, as lorry drivers or in kebab shops. There were also members of British-Bulgarian families, who had found themselves trapped in Bulgaria when the coronavirus struck and borders closed. Among the first through the arrivals hall was Sakak, a 35-year-old man from a village near the capital, Sofia, who asked not to disclose his surname. He and all the other passengers were wearing masks provided by the airline. “I need to work, I need the money,” Sakak said when asked why he had chosen to fly from Bulgaria, where there have been relatively few cases, to the UK, which is one of the worst-affected countries in the world on a per capita basis. “I come to work on the farm in the UK every year; I make the money for my family.” Sakak said he was “a bit” concerned about the high rate of Covid-19 infection in the UK, but said “it will probably be the same all round the world in the end”. He added: “I come from a tranquil village in the countryside and there is no corona there.” There have been just 1,541 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 66 deaths in Bulgaria, according to John Hopkins University coronavirus research centre. That compares with 177,454 cases and 27,510 deaths in the UK. Sakak is on his way to work on a farm in Maidstone, Kent. “I work as a driver taking people to the fields to pick raspberries and strawberries,” he said. While the airport is open, it is missing the noise, queues and shopping opportunities we have come to expect when traveling. Just two flights are scheduled to arrive at Luton on Friday (both Wizz Air flights from Sofia) bringing in a few hundred passengers, which compares with a pre-pandemic average of 49,000 passengers. There is nowhere to buy a cocktail, beer or even a coffee as all the shops are shuttered. Most of the car parks are closed, but two hardy bus drivers are on hand to drive the new arrivals to Luton airport train station. Optimistic Addison Lee drivers are offering one-way fares to central London for £96. A Warwickshire farmer in the arrivals hall said he was waiting to greet seven seasonal workers hired to pick vegetables. The farmer, who declined to give his name, said that if eastern European workers did not come to work in the UK this year “acres of food will rot in the fields”. He said it had already proved much harder than usual to hire workers this season. Only four of the seven workers he was expecting arrived. Alissa Kotsant, 22, a psychology student from Ramsgate, said she had travelled to Bulgaria to see her family before the virus struck and had found herself stuck there. “There is more virus in the UK than Bulgaria, but my life is here,” she said. “I had to come back.” Kotsant said she did not feel afraid during the flight despite being closely confined with lots of other people and unable to maintain a 2-metre physical distance, as advised by the government. “It was fine,” Kotsant said. “There were no sick people on the flight, and we all wore masks. You could smell that they had just cleaned the plane.” However, neither the airline nor the airports measured passengers temperatures to check for signs of fever, a key symptom of the viral infection. Kotsant said the flight was almost full, and that Wizz Air had not restricted travel in middle seats to create more space between customers. EasyJet, Emirates and Delta have suggested they will leave middle seats empty when coronavirus travel restrictions are lifted. Ryanair has said it will not resume flights if it is unable to sell tickets for the middle seat, as it will make it much harder to turn a profit. Iata, the global airline association, expects government measures to enforce social distancing on flights. Owain Jones, the managing director of Wizz Air UK said: “As we restart selected Luton flights to provide an essential service to passengers who need to travel, our primary concern is the health, safety and well-being of our customers and crew. The protective measures that we are implementing will ensure the most sanitary conditions possible.” The airline said cabin crew are “required to wear masks and gloves and will distribute sanitising wipes to each passenger”. Wizz Air said passengers are required to wear face masks although these would only be“initially provided by Wizz Air”. The Hungarian airline, which is listed on the London stock market, is also restarting flights between Luton and Budapest, Lisbon, Tenerife, Tel Aviv and Sofia, Varna and Burgas in Bulgaria. Several of the routes are open to citizens of the destination countries only. A London Luton Airport spokesman said: “The safety of our passengers and staff is our top priority and we continue to rigorously implement all government guidance. This includes deep cleaning, the installation of sanitiser across the airport and floor markings and signage to remind customers to maintain a safe distance. We are also displaying the latest public health guidance throughout the terminal. “Air links for both passengers and freight have been recognised as essential services and the government has asked airports to remain open where possible, to ensure they can continue. The decision to operate individual routes is a matter for each airline.”
162	Britain’s economy will shrink by a fifth during 2020 if the continued presence of Covid-19 means a full lockdown has to remain in place for a year, according to a study. With the government set to decide next week whether to ease restrictions put in place at the end of March, the consultancy firm Capital Economics said each additional month of full quarantining would knock 1.5 percentage points off annual growth. It said even with severe containment measures remaining in place only until the end of June and with some easing of restrictions in the coming weeks, the economy would shrink by 12% this year. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said there would be a much bigger hit if multiple peaks of the virus forced ministers to keep stringent measures in place until April 2021. In those circumstances, Gregory said, the economy would contract by 19.6% this year, a recession three times as severe as that which followed the global financial crisis in 2008. In addition, the expected bounceback in the economy would be delayed with the level of output still more than 6% below where it would have been in the absence of the pandemic by the end of 2022. On his return to work this week, Boris Johnson said that it was too soon to ease the lockdown despite signs that physical distancing had led to a fall in the number of hospital deaths and the number of new cases of Covid-19. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent body that provides economic forecasts for the government, has pencilled in a fall of 35% in gross domestic product in the second quarter on the assumption that a full lockdown remains in place until the end of June. The OBR is assuming half the restrictions will be lifted between July and September, with the rest being removed in the final three months of the year. On that basis, output would return to its pre-crisis level by the end of the year, with an annual fall in GDP between 2019 and 2020 of more than 13%. Gregory said she was assuming output had fallen by 25% from its pre-crisis peak during March and April, and would stagnate during May before starting to edge up in June. In the unlikely event of an immediate end to the lockdown, recovery would begin at the start of May but the economy would still shrink by 8.2% during 2020. Gregory said that all the scenarios outlined in her report were simplified versions of what the reality is likely to be: “The restrictions are unlikely to be relaxed all at once and there is already evidence that even while the economy is shut down some activity is trickling back.” She added: “The longer the restrictions are in place, the longer it may take the economy to recover to pre-recession levels because of scarring effects. Indeed, in the past four recessions it took between three and five years for the economy to return to its pre-crisis level.”
163	Nearly 130 parliamentarians, including former Conservative cabinet ministers, have written to Boris Johnson urging him to impose economic sanctions against Israel if Benjamin Netanyahu’s new coalition government goes ahead with its threat to annex parts of the West Bank. The letter, signed by the former Tory chairman Lord Patten and the former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell, says annexation would be clearly illegal under international law. The signatories, which also include diplomats and prominent campaigners against antisemitism in the Labour party such as Margaret Hodge, point out that the UK did not hesitate to sanction Russia after the annexation of Crimea, claiming any move in the West Bank would warrant a similar response. Netanyahu has negotiated a right to annex parts of the West Bank from 1 July in the coalition deal he signed with Benny Gantz’s Kahol Lavan party, but he is thought to be waiting for approval from the Trump administration before deciding his next move. Trump wants annexation to be seen to be integrated into the peace plan set out by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, last year. Britain joined a diplomatic démarche by 10 EU diplomats in a Zoom call this week warning the Israeli foreign ministry against annexation, but the imposition of sanctions as opposed to condemnation would be unprecedented. In the letter, organised by the Council for Arab British Understanding (Caabu), the signatories express outrage at the new Israeli government’s declared plan to annex areas of territories it occupied in June 1967, describing the move “as a mortal blow to the chances of peace between Israelis and Palestinians based on any viable two-state solution”. They claim it is clear the Israeli government is using “the cover of the Covid-19 pandemic to seek to implement this egregious plan. It is vital that the UK does everything in its power to prevent this.” They argue “international law is crystal clear. The acquisition of territory through war is prohibited. The Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 is a recent example where Britain quite properly opposed such acts with appropriate measures, including robust sanctions. “Our government has stated that any annexation ‘cannot go unchallenged. The government must now make clear publicly to Israel that any annexation will have severe consequences including sanctions. Words are not enough: Prime Minister Netanyahu has ignored our words. We need to prevent his government from setting this alarmingly dangerous precedent in international relations.” In a joint statement in September last year by the UK government, together with France, Germany, Italy and Spain, the UK warned any unilateral annexation of any part of the West Bank would be “a serious breach of international law”. David Jones, the chair of Caabu, said he regretfully thought Netanyahu would only listen to threats. Crispin Blunt, one of the signatories and the former chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said the issue was a massive test for the UK that he hoped his country would pass. He said he hoped Britain would take a stand by saying international law does stand for something, and bullying does not pay. Two Labour frontbenchers, Stephen Kinnock and Seema Malhotra, have signed the letter in a personal capacity, while the shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, has already written to the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, asking him to oppose annexation.

164	Canada has banned assault-style weapons following the murder of 22 people in the worst mass shooting in the country’s history, Justin Trudeau announced on Friday. “These weapons were designed for one purpose and one purpose only: to kill the largest number of people in the shortest amount of time. There is no use and no place for such weapons in Canada,” said the prime minister. “Effective immediately, it is no longer permitted to buy, sell, transport, import or use military-grade assault weapons in this country.” After the Nova Scotia shooting last week, Trudeau said his government intended “strengthen gun control” to fulfil a campaign promise to restrict certain weapons – a plan that had initially been derailed by the coronavirus pandemic. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said on Tuesday that the Nova Scotia gunman, Gabriel Wortman, had been armed with two semi-automatic rifles and several semi-automatic pistols. Supt Darren Campbell said that one of the guns could be described “military-style assault rifle”. The new ban would probably not have stopped Wortman from obtaining his weapons: he did not have a license to possess or purchase firearms, and police have said they believe the guns were obtained illegally in Canada and the United States. The prime minister announced a two-year “amnesty period” to allow gun owners to comply with the law. The ban covers 1,500 models and variants of firearms. Canada has one of the highest per capita gun ownership rates in the world, at an estimated 34.7 firearms per 100 people, according to the Small Arms Survey in 2018. The country still trails far behind the US, which has close to 120 guns per 100 people. While Trudeau promised in 2015 that a Liberal government would make it more difficult for gun owners to acquire certain types of firearms, it wasn’t until the most recent election campaign that the prime minister promised a full ban on “military-style assault weapons” if re-elected. “As long as Canadians are losing their loved ones to gun violence, not enough has changed,” Trudeau said in September. “We know you do not need a military-grade assault weapon, one designed to kill the largest amount of people in the shortest amount of time, to take down a deer.” At present, the Firearms Act does not make a distinction between “military-style” weapons and other type of long guns – meaning the government would also need to add amend the law. Trudeau had also previously promised to ban the Ruger Mini-14 rifle, the weapon used in the 1989 École Polytechnique shooting in Montreal, in which 14 women were murdered. The move to heavily restrict access to certain firearms will probably prompt anger from the opposition Conservative party and Canada’s gun lobby – but a ban of certain weapons can be carried out through cabinet, bypassing the need for legislation. “Justin Trudeau is using the current pandemic and the immediate emotion of the horrific attack in Nova Scotia to push the Liberals’ ideological agenda to make major firearms policy changes,” said the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer, following Trudeau’s comments. “Taking firearms away from law-abiding citizens does nothing to stop dangerous criminals who obtain their guns illegally.” Ken Price, whose daughter Samantha was hurt in a 2018 mass shooting in Toronto in which two people were killed and 13 injured, said he was “pleased to see movement” on the issue. “Having weapons that can be configured so that they inflict massive damage just doesn’t seem like the right thing to do – nor is it reflective of what the average Canadian wants,” he said. “And this still leaves plenty of choice for hunters, fishermen and sport shooters.” Price said Canada should also tighten controls on handguns and introduce “red flag laws” – enabling authorities to remove firearms from individuals deemed a risk to themselves or others – but said he was “pleased to see movement” on assault weapons. An “overwhelming majority” majority of Canadians – nearly four out of five people – support the ban, according to a poll from the Angus Reid Institute, released Friday.
165	At university in the early 90s, friends who were studying philosophy would enthuse about Solaris in the same smoke-filled breath as Hegel and Sartre – neither of whom I had read. But I felt at ease with nerdiness, in a room crowded with techno music and people lying about on the floor. Vicariously I became a purist, without ever watching the 1972 film by Andrei Tarkovsky nor reading the original novel by Stanisław Lem. And when Steven Soderbergh’s slicker, shorter, altogether shinier adaptation, starring George Clooney and Natasha McElhone, was released, I knowingly let it pass me by – why have Hollywood cotton when you could have Soviet silk? So it has taken me more than 25 years and the lockdown of a global pandemic to make time for Tarkovsky’s film, only to find that the more you attempt to understand Solaris, the more it defies explanation. Generations of scientists have risked their sanity trying to make sense of its sprawling ocean, a vast living organism that appears to be sentient; none has succeeded. The doomed hero of this story is Kris Kelvin (played by Donatas Banionis), a psychologist and expert in the field of Solaristics, who is dispatched to the station that orbits the planet to evaluate whether or not the troubled mission should continue. Its dwindling crew is under siege from mysterious figures – phantasmic incarnations of their own shameful memories and fantasies that seem to have risen up from the depths of the sea. Kelvin is greeted by devastation: his colleague Dr Gibarian has killed himself, while the other cosmonauts – Snaut and Sartorius – are hiding away in their cabins. The “visitor” that will drive Kelvin to the edge of madness is a simulacrum of his lost love, Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk), who killed herself long ago. He awakes in a dream to find her sitting before him – and so the living nightmare begins. Or, at least, this is where the film really gets going. Departing from the book, Tarkovsky opens on Earth. Entrancing images of the natural world – a leaf carried downstream, weeds undulating in the dark depths of a brook, thistles veiled in light mist – are set to the melancholic sound of an organ work by Bach (a musical embodiment of order, religious faith and reason) as Kelvin contemplates the garden at his family home. It is an exquisite conjuring of the universe he is preparing to leave behind, as well as a vision of lost childhood that reproduces the house the director grew up in. Tarkovsky is on home ground, then, yet uncannily so, as home, in that disturbing Wizard of Oz way, becomes somewhere yearned for, yet forever beyond reach. A similar meditation on nature occurs in Tarkovsky’s later science fiction film, Stalker, a journey through a post-apocalyptic wasteland called the “Zone” in search of a mythical house of dreams. And perhaps it was the remnants of the industrial landscape from that film that made me imagine the characters of Solaris would be trapped between brutalist grey walls in a dystopian black-and-white vision of solitude. We do get stark white interiors when Kelvin arrives in space, but this vision of the future is not so distant from the film’s present; he wears the same clothes he wore on Earth – a leather jacket and T-shirt (that bears an unfortunate passing resemblance to a string vest) – while his pyjamas really are monogrammed. Mirrors in each room reflect the cosmonaut’s journey into his interior world. Objects are imbued with memories: Bruegel’s The Hunters in the Snow hangs on the wood-panelled walls of the library, recalling the cold comforts of the earthly landscape he’s left behind. But return to that moment when the narrator, Kelvin, meets Hari in the book: “My first thought was: ‘I’m glad this is one of those dreams where you know you’re dreaming.’ All the same, I’d preferred her not to be there. I closed my eyes and began to wish this intensely, but when I opened them again she was still sitting there.” What I love is the way in which the film captures this merging of dreams and the waking world. Emerging eerily out of silence, the ambient sounds of Eduard Artemyev’s electronic score echo the warm glow of red sunlight that floods the room and catches soft hairs lining the contours of Hari’s face. Elsewhere, surreal happenings (a dwarf’s darting out from Sartorious’s cabin as he guards his door) or telling inconsistencies (the lack of fastener on Hari’s dress) go unexplained, occurring naturally within the rhythm and pace of an elliptical chain of events. As the camera slowly pans in long takes, characters that disappear from one point of view seem to occupy an entirely different space when seen from another, creating the effect of a lucid dream in which the camera is at once observing and determining the narrative. Bondarchuk is disconcertingly blank-faced and willing as she relives the traumatic loops of obsessive love that destroyed her; Banionis convincingly carries the burden of guilt of a man whose first desperate attempt to get rid of the problem involves folding her into a rocket and launching her into space. Relating was clearly never his strong point. But what to make of it all? I’m still none the wiser. Tarkovsky set out to expose the “phoniness” of Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey with this interrogation of the human condition and the result is a strange kind of psychological horror. The vividly coloured and intricately textured forms of Lem’s majestically rendered ocean – so profoundly unsettling in the novel – are almost an afterthought here. Soderbergh’s sea at least gives off a nice CGI shimmer in a telling that ticks off Lem’s underlying philosophical queries with impressive efficiency. (Questions of faith, the existence of God and the limitations of human understanding are raised and dealt with in the exchanges of a 30-second dinner party conversation.) But, in the absence of CGI, and a musical score that tells you how to feel, Tarkovsky’s dreamworld draws you in; you don’t need an ocean to sense a world at sea.
166	This government should be on the rack. The evidence that it botched crucial decisions at crucial moments is piling up. The litany is now so familiar it barely needs repeating, from the failure to secure personal protective equipment for frontline workers in health and social care to the 11 lost days of delay before imposing a lockdown that has proved essential for saving lives. You can focus on specific judgments: why did ministers allow mass gatherings, from racing at Cheltenham to a Stereophonics gig in Cardiff, ignoring the warnings that such events would be a virus-fest? Why did it initially tell people to stay away from pubs and restaurants, but simultaneously allow those places to stay open? Why did the government call a halt in March to testing and tracing? If the answer is a lack of capacity, then why did it not immediately set about recruiting the “army of contact tracers” that will be required if we are ever to emerge from our homes? Why the focus on mega-labs, rather than seizing on the offer of small laboratories to do testing for their local hospitals, which, as Paul Nurse, director of the Francis Crick Institute, has argued, could have made those hospitals “safe places”? Why the rules initially limiting tests to those NHS employees with symptoms, which, as Nurse puts it, allowed staff to be on wards “infecting people”? Or you can look at decisions going back a decade, pointing a finger at Tory austerity that starved public services to the bone, leaving them underequipped and eroding our resilience. Either way, the country now faces a death toll approaching 30,000. And yet, far from being on the rack, the government continues to bask in public support. True, approval for the government’s handling of the crisis has fallen from the dizzying 61% it reached a month ago to 51% at last count. But 51% is still the kind of approval rating most politicians long for. What accounts for this disconnect between the government’s record and the public’s high regard for those responsible? Put another way, why isn’t Boris Johnson in more trouble? Any answer must begin with what pollsters call the “rally-around-the-flag” effect, the tendency for voters to back their leaders in a time of crisis. Data from around the world, in this era and in others, suggests that when citizens are scared, they want to believe those in charge have the wisdom and strength to protect them. Think of electorates as passengers on a plummeting plane: in that moment of peril, they need to trust the pilot. In Johnson’s case, there’s an additional factor. No one can throw at him the traditional accusation directed at politicians, namely that he is out of touch with the seriousness of the disease. His own near-death experience with Covid-19 immunises him from that charge. The outpouring of sympathy while he clung to life in intensive care was real; some of it lingers when he briefs the nation from No 10 and grows visibly tired before the hour is up. That might prompt some voters to go a bit easier on the prime minister than they otherwise would, an indulgence buttressed by the arrival this week of a Downing Street baby. The extraordinary month Johnson has endured acts to protect the prime minister and, since this is very much his administration, the entire government. He’s helped, too, by the fact that there is so little we know for certain about this disease. The UK may have the highest death rate in Europe, but as David Spiegelhalter argued persuasively, we won’t be sure of that “until the end of the year, and the years after that”. Even if Britain does turn out to be the worst hit, it’ll be easy to argue that it wasn’t the government’s fault but was rather a function of certain immovable facts about this country: that, for example, it includes a city, London, that has no direct European equivalent in size or scale. Some voters are surely minded to give the government the benefit of the doubt on the grounds that it has merely been “following the science”. That could prove a valuable alibi, nicely positioning the scientists as the fall guys once all this is done. Even those who know that when it comes to public health policy there is no such thing as “the science” – that there are always going to be competing views over how to act on data once you’ve got it – could see that as a reason to cut ministers some slack: faced with a near-unprecedented threat, politicians have had to make life-and-death decisions with no clear manual to follow. It helps that much of the press is supportive, putting the Johnson baby news or Capt Tom Moore on the front and condemning the dead to the inside pages. It’s handy, too, to have a few outriders attacking journalists for daring to ask awkward questions at a time like this, suggesting they should be biting their tongues in the spirit of national unity (when, of course, asking awkward questions of those in power is journalists’ essential duty). Nor does it hurt to have an opposition that – for reasons that may make sound political sense – has decided to offer mild, “constructive” criticism rather than to put the boot in. All of these factors have helped insulate the government from the flak that would otherwise be coming its way. But there’s one more, perhaps less obvious explanation – and it relates to judgment by comparison. We don’t need to wait for a full statistical analysis to know that Johnson has not been the worst world leader in this crisis, because we can declare a winner in that contest right now. Each day Britons wake up to ever more jaw-dropping news from across the Atlantic. Last week, it was Donald Trump advising Americans to inject bleach. On Friday, it was his claim to have seen evidence that coronavirus was developed in a Wuhan laboratory, a claim denied by his own director of national intelligence. The shocking images of protesters wielding assault weapons storming into the state assembly in Michigan on Thursday night are hardly a surprise, given that Trump himself was tweeting “Liberate Michigan!” a matter of days ago, cheering on those who are demanding their states defy the advice of Trump’s own White House and prematurely end the lockdown that has so far proved to be the only way to stop the virus. However bad Johnson and his government of conspicuously few talents is, we know they’re not that. They can at least show a modicum of human empathy for those who’ve lost loved ones, a feat that continues to elude Trump. They have at least – eventually – united behind a coherent “stay home” message, rather than undermining that advice at every turn. They are not hawking quack cures and endorsing deranged conspiracy theories. They do not seem willing to countenance mass death in the insane belief that it will help them win an election. It’s a low bar, but these are low times. • Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist
167	My mother Marion Jordan’s favourite occupation was “student”. Marion, who has died aged 91, was one of the first postwar tranche of women to go to university – to Manchester University, where, after her English degree, she went on to study for an MA and a PhD in Russian. Later she gained an MLitt in film studies from Warwick University, and later still, in her 80s, she got an A-level in Italian. She taught English at Madeley College in Staffordshire (1967-77) and film studies at Warwick University (1977-85), and wrote Carry On … Follow That Stereotype, an essay for British Cinema History (1983). Marion was born in rural Blackmoorfoot, outside Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, the 13th child of Ben and Emma Armitage, who lived in a tied farm cottage. She attended a “five to 14” elementary school before going to Honley grammar school at the age of 10. At Manchester University, she met Dominic Jordan and they married in 1953. Keele University, where Dominic became head of the mathematics department, was to be home for many years and it was the perfect setting for Marion to engage her fierce competitive spirit on the squash and tennis courts, representing Staffordshire in both sports. She listened to the music of Kathleen Ferrier, remarking it was “the first time I understood that one might listen to music rather than simply hear it”, and that of Benjamin Britten, to celebrate her love of ballads, English language and Englishness, and learned to play John Dowland’s Lachrimae Pavane on the guitar. Marion was a passionate bridge player. She was fond of travelling far and wide to play in weekend tournaments with many successes, and regularly played for her county. On occasion she would play seven days a week, winning competitions at her beloved Newcastle-Under-Lyme bridge club that included the ladies pairs title when she was 91. She last played tennis in her 87th year and won the ladies singles at Alsager Tennis Club when she was 65 – but told everyone there that she was only 60. She had her own bylaws – she had to play with her preferred partner, and always served from the “good” end. Nobody dissented. Dominic died in 2012. Marion is survived by her two sons, Matthew and me, and two granddaughters, Anna and Martha.
168	An outbreak of Covid-19 among workers in a meat factory in Tipperary has raised fears that the virus is spreading through abattoirs and meat-processing plants in Ireland. Sinn Féin’s spokesperson on agriculture, Brian Stanley, told the Irish parliament last night that 120 workers at the Rosderra Meats plant in Roscrea had tested positive for the virus. He also said that of 350 workers at the plant, up to 140 were off sick last week. Rosderra is the largest pork-processing company in Ireland. Michael Creed, Ireland’s agriculture minister, told MPs that he was aware of six meat-processing plants with two or more confirmed cases of Covid-19 among workers, although he did not name them. A spokesperson for Rosderra Meats confirmed to the Guardian that a number of employees had tested positive for coronavirus. They said that the company had implemented stringent measures to ensure the safety of employees, and added that production will be scaled down until all staff return to work. The news came as one of Ireland’s biggest beef companies announced a Covid-related shutdown. Dawn Meats said on Friday that it had temporarily closed its plant in Westmeath after four workers tested positive for coronavirus. Dawn Meats produces more than 400 million burgers a year for McDonald’s outlets in the UK and Europe. In a statement, the company said that the plant had been closed “out of an abundance of caution”. It has yet to decide if it will reopen next week. Workers at other meat plants, who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, said they were frightened of contracting the virus, and expressed deep concern that social distancing is not being enforced on some factory floors. One said that “people are on top of each other, it’s like a cattle mart”. A complaint made to a line manager was ignored, they say. The closure has raised deep concerns that Ireland’s export-driven agri-food sector will be severely hit by the pandemic. Agri-food is the most important domestic industry in the country, employing more than 170,000 people. Produce is exported to more than 180 countries and the sector is worth €14bn (£12.3bn) to the economy. The US, another country where the meat industry is a vital economic component with a powerful lobby, has been hit so hard by coronavirus-related closures that President Donald Trump this week signed an executive order to keep meat plants open. There are fears that prices and supply may be seriously disrupted. In Northern Ireland, union representatives are pushing owners to undertake full health and safety risk assessments at meat plants, following concerns that factories are not putting workers’ safety first. “Companies are not enforcing social distancing and definitely not providing enough PPE,” said Brian Hewitt of Unite, who said he was aware of positive cases of the virus in workers at meat plants in Armagh and Tyrone. “Workers are afraid of getting infected,” he said. In March, workers at the poultry processor Moy Park in Portadown walked out over fears that the company was putting employees at risk of infection. Sean McKevitt of Unite, who represents the workers, said on Friday that following negotiations with the company there was an “improved picture” for staff at Moy Park’s Dungannon and Portadown plants. Social distancing was in place, and workers had secured an additional £30 a week payment. There are more than 20,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Ireland, according to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, and 1,232 people diagnosed with the virus have died. The lockdown restrictions that were put in place to manage the spread of the virus are expected to remain for the coming weeks.
169	My colleague Barbara Smoker, who has died aged 96, was president of the National Secular Society for a quarter of a century and a humanist activist for 70 years. As a grande dame humanist, her style of campaigning, like her prose and her conversation, was direct and uncompromising. In 1989 she stood in front of a demonstration of Muslims calling for the death of Salman Rushdie with a simple placard saying Free Speech, and she remained firm even as she was physically attacked. She was a regular at Speakers’ Corner in London and at debates and podiums around the world, including on speaking tours across the US and India. Barbara was born in Catford, south London, to Roman Catholic parents, Gilbert Smoker, a trader in clothing, and his wife, Amy (nee Morris). She had a convent education and as a child had intended to be either a nun or a devotional author. However, when she reached the age of 18 during the second world war she went to serve in the Women’s Royal Naval Service in south-east Asia from 1942 to 1945, and after the war she made a living through secretarial work. In 1949, at the age of 26, the realisation that she was a humanist and no longer a Catholic suddenly struck her on a visit to the philosophy section of a public library – a moment, she told me, that was “like an enormous orgasm”. In the 1950s she became a member of the Ethical Union (now Humanists UK) and the South Place Ethical Society, based at Conway Hall in London, and for the rest of her life devoted herself to advancing the cause of humanism. Any concept of a conventional working career took a back seat to that preoccupation, and for most of the time Barbara survived by taking on temporary jobs, often secretarial in nature, while also generating cash through writing articles, entering and winning competitions in magazines and gambling on the horses. Of necessity, and of choice, she always lived frugally. Eventually Barbara became president of the National Secular Society in 1972, and she held that post until 1996, representing the atheist viewpoint in print, on lecture platforms, on speaking tours, and on radio and television. Her book Humanism, commissioned as one of a series for school religious education courses, was published in 1973 and is still in print today. Her collected articles for the Freethinker magazine were published in 2002. She was also chair of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society (now Dignity in Dying) from 1981 to 1985, and supported many other causes and movements, including for nuclear disarmament, abolition of the death penalty, prison reform, decriminalisation of abortion, and gay rights. Her memoirs were published in 2018 as My Godforsaken Life. She was a contented person, unencumbered by material possessions or regrets, but loved and supported by a wide array of nephews and nieces – the one advantage, she once told me, of her Catholic origins.
170	When your favourite comfort food is calling, it can be hard to resist. Crisp and crunchy fish and chips, juicy burgers and decadent chocolate brownies are simply too much of a temptation, no matter that you’ve promised to be good this week. But you don’t have to choose between health and hankering after a little indulgence: we’ve rewritten the cookbook to give five comfort foods a healthier makeover. Using simple swaps we’ve reduced the salt, sugar and fat content of some of our favourite family meals, as well as increasing the vitamin and mineral content with a few extra portions of veg. What’s more – there’s no compromise on flavour. Here’s how to have your cake and eat it (and your chips, and your fry-up …). Healthier burger and chips Adding grated carrot or courgette to your favourite burger recipe is a savvy way to cut the fat content and increase your daily veg intake – and it keeps burgers moist, too. Grate the vegetables finely, squeeze out as much liquid as you can, and stir in to lean mince, adding a dash of Worcestershire sauce and an egg to hold it all together. Cook the burgers on a griddle or in a frying pan and pile them up with plenty of tomatoes, crunchy lettuce and pickles. For healthier chips, cut large potatoes into thick fingers, boil them for four minutes and then roast in a hot oven with a drizzle of olive oil for 30 minutes or until golden. Less grease, less guilt – and lots of grinning faces around the table. Better weekend brunch Rather than messing up every frying pan in the house, try cooking your weekend breakfast in the oven like a tray bake. You’ll use less oil by cooking all the ingredients together, and by opting for Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz, which are naturally high in fibre and protein and have 25% less salt than standard baked beans, and you’ll get a healthier breakfast all round. Start by roasting sausages with sliced red onion, small cubes of sweet potato and a drizzle of oil in a hot oven. After about 20 minutes, or when the potatoes soften and the sausages are almost cooked through, add baby tomatoes on the vine, a handful of sliced flat-cap mushrooms and a few thyme sprigs, and bake for another 10 minutes. Make eight small gaps in the tray; crack eggs into four of the holes and spoon Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz into the others, then bake for four minutes until the egg whites are set and the beans are warmed through. Serve with toast and a pot of tea. Feelgood fish and chips Replace your normal fish-batter recipe with this healthier egg-based version – it’s salt free and cooks well in the oven. Not only are you increasing the protein content of this family favourite but by avoiding the deep-fat fryer you’ll cut down the fat content considerably. Whisk one egg white until stiff peaks form, then fold it into the broken yolk, adding lemon zest and finely chopped parsley. Dip two cod fillets into the egg-white batter and bake at 200C/fan 180C/gas mark 6 for 15 minutes until the batter is crisp and the fish is cooked through. Serve with healthier oven-cooked chips, see recipe above, and minty crushed peas or with a big green salad. Guilt-free chocolate brownies It’s a universal fact that the ultimate chocolate brownie should be dense and fudgy on the inside, with a slightly crisp top for complete satisfaction. The big secret is that this can be achieved without a lot of butter and sugar! Tinned black beans or sweet potato work wonderfully in chocolate brownies, as they have a natural sweetness and a fudgy texture that stands up to the dark chocolate. For black bean brownies, replace the butter with a tin of beans and a little oil. And replace the sugar with maple syrup. For the sweet potato option, use two large sweet potatoes cooked and mashed and 14 dates to replace the butter and sugar respectively. A more unusual substitution is mayonnaise. Swap out butter for your favourite low-cal mayo and you’ll get the same rich, gooey brownie but with less fat and fewer calories. Alternative beans on toast Yes, beans on toast covered in melted cheese can solve most of your problems, but there are healthier ways to get the same hit. This baked-bean quesadilla is a fun, Mexican twist on a teatime treat and has all the beany-cheesy goodness but less sugar, salt and fat. Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz count as one of your five a day, and they’re naturally low in fat, with no added sugars, artificial colours, flavours or preservatives, which makes them a healthier alternative for all the family. Heat up a portion of the beans and then microwave two wholewheat flour tortillas for 15 seconds, or until warm. Spoon the hot beans over one tortilla using a slotted spoon so you don’t get too much sauce (no one wants soggy tortillas), and mash the beans lightly with a fork. Sprinkle with low-fat feta cheese, fresh coriander and a squeeze of lime, then put the other tortilla on top. Cut into four and serve with a big green salad, and a slightly smug feeling on the side. While you might not be able to stop the cravings, you can transform your food with a few healthy swaps – like using Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz, sneaking in some extra vegetables, or getting creative with your cooking.

171	Sudan looks set to outlaw female genital mutilation (FGM), in a significant move welcomed by campaigners. Anyone found carrying out FGM will face up to three years in prison, according to a document seen by the Guardian. The council of ministers approved the new law on 22 April, but it still needs to be passed by members of the sovereign council, which was created following the ousting of former dictator Omar al-Bashir. Amira Azhary, from the National Council for Child Welfare and a campaigner for the Saleema initiative, which campaigns for an end to the practice, said: “We expect that the law will be passed by the sovereign council and if that happens, it will be an expression of the political will in this country.” Sudan has one of the highest rates of FGM in the world. According to the UN, 87% of Sudanese women have undergone the practice. Girls are usually cut between the ages of five and 14. However, because the practice is entrenched in Sudanese culture, activists expect it will take a long time to be eradicated entirely. “There is so much work to be done. This is a start, a good start,” said Fatma Naib, communication officer of the UN children’s agency, Unicef, in Sudan. “The crucial step will be to ensure there are consequences for those who perform the cut on their girls.” Some states in the country banned FGM a few years ago, but attempts to ban it nationally were not successful under Bashir. “Sudanese women along with the Egyptians and Somalis have been leading the fight against FGM,” said Nimco Ali, a leading anti-FGM activist who heads up the Five Foundation, a global partnership to end the practice. “Sudanese women have always wanted to end FGM. Sudan took the same path as Egypt politically – and that means women can also lead and be part of the transitional government.” The UK’s international development secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, tweeted: “In our turbulent world, fantastic to see the new government in #Sudan outlawing female genital mutilation. There is no place for #FGM in the 21st century.” Baroness Sugg, the UK’s special envoy for girls’ education, tweeted: “This is a vital step towards a world where every girl is safe.” FGM involves the partial or total removal of the female external genitalia for non-medical reasons. The UN estimates that 200 million women and girls have undergone FGM in 31 countries – 27 of which are in Africa. However, a report published in March said the number could be much higher as the practice is carried out in more than 90 countries, many of which do not collect data. World leaders have pledged to eliminate FGM by 2030.
172	How maddening to learn the Nigerian president has appointed a dead man to run a government agency. This is what happens when you’re in a global procurement race for resources. If the UK had only acted quicker, that guy could have chaired our public inquiry into the handling of the coronavirus. Of course, we already boast an estimated 45,000 of what our insanely euphemistic government might describe as “resources”, in the form of those who have … gone to a better place, is it? Been selected for immortality? Ascended to virus Valhalla? Either way, it’s great to see the government ramping up the positivity, now that returning prime minister Boris Johnson has replaced broken Pez dispenser Dominic Raab. Judging by the prime minister’s Thursday press conference, you’ll hear a lot more emphasis on the fact that the NHS has not been overwhelmed, and a lot less emphasis on those of our loved ones who may have … been overwhelmed. The UK is on course to have the worst continental death toll, which you should expect the government to characterise as winning the Euros. The one thing it’s hard to understand is the supposed crisis in fruit- and veg-picking, given how many people have recently gone to live on a farm. If that dead Nigerian can’t whitewash all this for us, then, the inquiry is the perfect one to be chaired by his lordship Alan Sugar. Like me, you probably prefer to get all your news analysis/conspiracy theories/desktop email phones from this booster-seated biz-troll – so you’ll be delighted by the fact that Sugar has really leaned in to a self-appointed consultancy role during the virus crisis. Alas, defects in our political system, compared with that of the United States, mean the route from the Apprentice boardroom to Downing Street remains obscure. Though let’s be encouraged that Lord Sugar has, in his time, been made a business tsar by both Labour and Conservative governments. He is currently pushing his theory that the media should not ask the government “negative” questions, but instead promote “hope, optimism and faith”. In one sense, it’s understandable. Alan lives what passes for his professional life surrounded by misplaced positivity. He heads up a show where people spend 12 weeks being exposed as obnoxiously unemployable on primetime national television, then mark their exit by saying “Thank you for the opportunity”. For the next series, I’m sure he’ll take a leaf out of his own book and retire his negative “You’re fired” catchphrase. I’d go with something like “You’re downsized” or “You’re being offered a universal credit opportunity”, or “You’re being made assistant editor (of something in brackets)”. For those worrying Sugar himself might be somehow downsized for his other contribution – posting dangerous misinformation and refusing to delete it until many hours after it was revealed as a hoax – please don’t be. He can never be “let go” by the BBC as Apprentice frontman, because there is simply no other business visionary so desperate for attention that they would give large amounts of their own money, every year, to one of 15 missing links between the vegetable and mineral kingdoms, chosen simply for their ability to make hatewatchable television. Sugar’s job couldn’t be safer if he was a funeral director. (Having said all that – is Richard Branson soon to be “a lot freer”, “timewise”? I hope not. The last thing Lord Suralan could handle is the emergence of a peer group of even one.) Happily, the government is obliging his desire for taking the positives. Johnson’s rose-tinted address on Thursday reminded me of the speech at the end of Tom Stoppard’s play Jumpers, where a distinctly immoral man looks on the bright side with lines such as: “Millions of children grow up without suffering deprivation, and millions, while deprived, grow up without suffering cruelties, and millions, while deprived and cruelly treated, none the less grow up.” That is, naturally, 45,000 times better written than the fare served up by Johnson. “We are coming through the peak,” he wibbled yesterday, “or rather we are coming over what could have been a vast peak, as though we have been going through some huge Alpine tunnel. And we can now see the sunlight and the pastures ahead of us … ” Ah, sunlight. Mountains. You may recognise these from such Johnson metaphors as “the sunlit uplands” of Brexit. Is he saying we’re finally in the sunlit uplands? No, hang on – these pastures are very much not up. Are they the sunlit downlands? And we access them via a tunnel over a semi-vast peak, yes? Could you give me directions toward your point, prime minister, as I’m afraid Google Maps doesn’t seem to be working at this altitude/depth? The one thing no one ever says is: “Who writes this shit for him?” Such metaphors are all very much “model’s own”. It’s an almost unique form of self-confidence. Once you become actual prime minister, and have a paid talent pool to draw upon, most holders of the position get themselves a speechwriter. But not Johnson. In terms of an individual refusing to take advantage of the vast wherewithal on offer, I can’t think of a more horrifying example of anyone thinking they can do a better job themselves. Not even Celine Dion’s fashion sense. Johnson’s refusal to get himself a (prose) stylist means the nation now is going to have to board these verbal funiculars at 5pm daily, and hope they cling to the traction cable tightly enough to deposit us at the … but no. Sorry, I can’t do this. Maybe next week. For now, let’s play out with the prime minister’s assertion that being on course for one of the worst death tolls in the world means we’ve “avoid[ed] the tragedy that engulfed other parts of the world”. What can you say? Other than: thank you. Thank you for the opportunity. • Marina Hyde is a Guardian journalist

They wanted to tap the creative potential of the unconscious mind, and games like Exquisite Corpse – the avant-garde answer to consequences – helped. Exquisite Corpse quickly turns into a swearing and obscenity contest, at least in my family, and is totally hilarious.

174	Scientists working for the US military have designed a new Covid-19 test that could potentially identify carriers before they become infectious and spread the disease, the Guardian has learned. In what could be a significant breakthrough, project coordinators hope the blood-based test will be able to detect the virus’s presence as early as 24 hours after infection – before people show symptoms and several days before a carrier is considered capable of spreading it to other people. That is also around four days before current tests can detect the virus. The test has emerged from a project set up by the US military’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) aimed at rapid diagnosis of germ or chemical warfare poisoning. It was hurriedly repurposed when the pandemic broke out and the new test is expected to be put forward for emergency use approval (EUA) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within a week. “The concept fills a diagnostic gap worldwide,” the head of Darpa’s biological technologies office, Dr Brad Ringeisen, told the Guardian, since it should also fill in testing gaps at later stages of the infection. If given FDA approval, he said, it had the potential to be “absolutely a gamechanger”. While pre-infectious detection would improve the efficiency of test-and-trace programmes as governments worldwide relax lockdowns, Darpa cautioned that it must wait until after FDA approval is given and the test can be put into practise for evidence of exactly how early it can pick up the virus. “The goal of research is to develop and validate an early host blood response diagnostic test for Covid,” Prof Stuart Sealfon, who leads the research team at Mount Sinai hospital in New York, said in an email. He said the testing approach, which looks at the body’s response as it fights Covid-19, should produce earlier results than current nose-swab tests that hunt for the virus itself. “Because the immune response to infection develops immediately after infection, a Covid signature is expected to provide more sensitive Covid infection diagnosis earlier,” he told the Guardian. The research behind the development of the tests will eventually be made public, with the collaborating teams from medical schools at Mount Sinai, Duke University and Princeton expected to publish online, allowing scientists around the world to trial similar methods. If EUA is granted, the test should start being rolled out in the US in the second half of May. Approval is not guaranteed, but Darpa scientists are enthusiastic about the potential impact as governments loosen lockdowns amid worries about controlling potential second-wave outbreaks. “We are all extremely excited. We want to roll this test out as quickly as we can, but at the same time share with others who might want to implement in their own countries,” said Dr Eric Van Gieson, who set up Darpa’s epigenetic characterization and observation (Echo) programme last year to diagnose biological warfare victims, and has redirected it to focus on Covid-19. Epigenetics looks at a set of controls on genes that can respond to the environment. Hope that the test might pick up carriers before they become infectious is based on previous research into other viruses, though Sealfon said this remained “unknown” for Covid-19. “We have evidence that diagnosis happens in the first 24 hours for influenza and an adenovirus,” Van Gieson said. “We are still in the midst of proving that with Covid-19. That said, we should know very soon after EUA.” He sees potential for the US to carry out up to a million tests a day, starting with 100,000 daily in May. The test would up the possibility of isolating pre-infectious cases and closing down transmission chains. It could also dramatically reduce quarantine periods for people exposed to Covid-19 spreaders, allowing them to go back to work within days. “It could have exceptional demand,” said Chris Linthwaite, the chief executive of Fluidigm, a California life-sciences technology company that is part of the project, who believes frequent testing can help manage workforces as they return to offices, warehouses and factories. The UK government announced plans two weeks ago to restart a contact-tracing programme that was abandoned early in the outbreak. Britain’s stated target was 100,000 tests a day by the end of April. France announced on Tuesday that it would test 700,000 people a week, including those without symptoms. Other countries such as South Korea, Australia and New Zealand already have efficient tracing systems, but they would be boosted if carriers could be detected early. Darpa experts also see potential to improve protocols for protecting health care workers and others in high-risk jobs, as well as those in relatively self-contained or isolated communities such as care homes and prisons or onboard ships. The test uses the same polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machines used for checking nasal swabs from people suspected of having the virus. “It’s a simple tweak,” said Van Gieson. “The infrastructure is already there.” Limitations on use are similar to those already faced by countries such as Britain and depend on PCR capacity, stocks of chemical reagents and logistics. Results can take an hour, or longer if samples must be sent away to laboratories. Like the viral test, the new blood test hunts for a type of molecule called RNA. In this case it is messenger RNA (mRNA). “Target mRNA is part of the immune response to viral infection,” Sealfon said. “mRNA expression levels really do adjust due to the presence of Covid-19. Understanding the immune response is key to fighting Covid-19.” Covid-19 is thought to incubate for about five days, at which stage people are assumed to become infectious. That is also when the virus can be detected by current nose swab tests. “They do the job, they just don’t tell you someone is sick until maybe four days after this [new test],” said Van Gieson. The research shows accuracy levels above 95%. “This is something that will need to be constantly monitored as it will inevitably change up or down,” Van Gieson said. Blood samples are harder to collect than nose swabs, but may be more reliable. Swab testing can be difficult because it requires taking a sample from deep inside the nose. “It can throw up a lot of false negatives,” said Prof Lawrence Young of Warwick University, adding that recent studies showing low reliability were probably due to poor swab sampling. “I’ve been very concerned by pictures on the television of drive-in testing. Something you could measure reliably in blood could be a good thing.” Like all researchers contacted by the Guardian, however, he was unwilling to comment further until the Mount Sinai-led team published its research. Most were concerned about potential problems with accuracy and practicality. Blood collection is a potential limitation, since drive-in centres are not usually equipped to do this. One millilitre of blood – a fifth of a teaspoon – is needed. The research team is expected to publish the mRNA sequence, allowing others to create the so-called “primer” required. A similar approach was taken when the genetic sequence of the virus itself was released by China in January, allowing tests to be developed rapidly in South Korea and elsewhere.
175	HUMANITY AND LAWYERS Hurray! The football season is back! Six hundred years after the last match, everyone’s favourite sport has returned in the style we have come to know and follow with ill relish. And it’s all thanks to the French government, whose decision to ban team japes until September has kicked off the biggest hoohah since 2010, when Les Bleus decided it was simply impossible to envisage playing the World Cup so long as their manager spoke in a brusque tone. Following their government’s decree, the French league declared the season over and then confirmed the standings after 28 matches (27 in some cases) as the final table. That sealed a fairytale title triumph for the Embassy of Qatar, and Big Cup qualifications for Marseille and Rennes. But it also condemned Lyon to missing out on European competition for the first time in 24 years, and the club’s overlord, Jean-Michel Aulas, says that’s a bowl of sick he won’t swallow. “This is robbing us of an opportunity that is very significant, of high value,” he howled before vowing to deploy a crack squad of lawyers in an eat-this-mofos formation. “We are going to claim damages worth several dozen million euros,” stormed Aulas, scratching his nails down a chalkboard. “Noël Le Graët has to face the consequences as president of the FFF. His management here was poor. There were poorly thought-out decisions.” Aulas had proposed alternative ways of determining the final standings, including play-offs whenever, and pointed out that Lyon have a habit of finishing seasons strongly. A similar claim was made by the president of Amiens, who have been consigned to relegation. “Since our non-league days our success has always been built on our finishes to the season,” declared Bernard Joannin, the head of a club who had hope of survival despite being on a 13-match winless run. “I will go to the end to uphold our rights because I am a warrior. There were still 30 points up for grabs and we were just four below Nîmes! Football has shown a lack of humanity with this decision.” The only way to restore humanity, as everyone knows, is to call in the lawyers. QUOTE OF THE DAY “When he arrived I was the only person who spoke English. So one night I went to his home and he asked me if I wanted something to drink.

FIVER LETTERS “As esports have become the ‘in’ thing (unless you give a darn about Belarusian football), I suggest teaching Premier League managers video-game skills to finish the season. I can see Jürgen Klopp smiling at his monitor as Liverpool win the title. The vision of David Moyes and Mr Roy trying to figure the controls, however, would be comic genius or lead viewers to join the START FOOTBALL campaign” – JJ Zucal. “While the top levels of football discuss how to end the season, the decision to completely void the 2019-20 campaign for most of non-league was taken several weeks ago, and teams are starting to plan for next season. One club, Basford United of the Northern Premier League, announced that five players have signed new contracts, including forward Rev James.

Today’s winner of our prizeless letter o’the day is … Ed Taylor. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS The Championship is making plans to hold play-offs on neutral turf and without fans even if the season isn’t completed, while promoting Nasty Leeds and West Brom. Bradford City say the chances of fans being able to attend EFL games again this year are slim. The club think next season is “highly likely” to begin behind closed doors, with an “ever-growing possibility” that supporters will be kept away until 2021. Premier League clubs have shelled out on coronavirus testing machines that can turn around results in two-and-a-half hours as they try to find a way to complete the season. Brighton elder Glenn Murray is not into the idea of wearing a face mask at training. “It is going to be off-putting, it is not going to be natural,” he said. “People are going to be ripping them off in the middle of training. I think it is quite farcical.” Sergio Agüero reckons footballers will be fearful of returning while Covid-19 is still wreaking havoc in society. “The majority of players are scared because they have family, they have children, they have babies,” said the Manchester City striker. “I imagine that we will be very tense. It does scare me.” Meanwhile in Brazil, delightful-as-ever president Jair Bolsonaro wants footballers to just get back out there because they only “have a small chance of dying”. And Marvin Sordell has welcomed the chance to “create a better environment for the beautiful game” after joining Liam Rosenior on the FA’s Inclusion Advisory Board. STILL WANT MORE? “I still don’t have the words and don’t think I ever will. I’ll never forget it; it’s etched on my heart.” Pablo Marí gets his chat on with Sid Lowe and recalls being the first Spaniard to win the Brazilian title and South American Big Cup and how his Arsenal career was put on hold before it ever got started. Former Reading player Scott Davies talks openly to Ben Fisher about how he is using his experience of addiction to educate footballers about the dangers of gambling and how the shutdown has left restless players at risk. Michael Butler spent loads of time reading footballers’ autobiographies so he could bring you this quotes quiz, so the least you can do is give it a go. Bale! Bendtner! Er, Lee Chung-yong?

176	‘It was doomed from the start’ Alan Ayckbourn on Jeeves (1975) The biggest failure I ever had was my first attempt at a musical. Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice had just had two big successes with Joseph and Jesus Christ Superstar, and I was the golden boy of the West End at that point. So somebody had the bright idea of bringing the three of us together to adapt the stories of PG Wodehouse. It was doomed from the start. People were jumping on board with no previous experience. It was a case of the blind leading the blind. Tim had cold feet and Andrew said I could be the lyricist – “piece of cake”. I remember thinking Hammerstein and Gershwin would be turning in their graves. We had this idea that David Wood (playing Bingo Little) would be on a chandelier swinging around, but found out he gets the most appalling vertigo. He got up on his toes and he started screaming, so we had to abandon it. I wrote something that was enormously long and we never actually did a run-through. The first performance went on and on and on. The musicians had a four-hour call, so once we got to the four-hour mark, they all trailed out and went to the pub. The poor conductor very gallantly ran for the piano and played the last number, but with the cast not being operatically trained, they were completely thrown once they’d lost their harmonies. There was a lot of slamming of seats. We made ruthless cuts and staggered on. It never got any better. I cut some ballet sequences and the choreographer walked out. Come first night, Andrew said: “Are you going to sit in?” I said: “No, I don’t think so.” We went to a club round the corner and came back at the end. Apparently the audience had been booing. The rest of the cast had fled. We went to see David Hemmings, who was playing Bertie Wooster, who we heard was still in his dressing room. He was crying and sitting in the shower so I stepped in to get to him and told him it was all our fault. I was soaking wet, it was like a farce. It ran for another three sad weeks and got universally awful reviews. I said that was my lot as far as musicals are concerned. The next thing I did was Bedroom Farce, no songs at all. ‘Ever been spanked on the derrière?’ Lynn Nottage on Por’Knockers (1995) I still remember an audience member ripping up their programme into tiny shreds and throwing it like confetti, saying: “I am cancelling my subscription to the theatre!” Por’Knockers is a social satire about a group of radical idealists who blow up a building and inadvertently kill some children who are playing inside. I wrote it after working for Amnesty International for a number of years, when the world felt topsy-turvy. It was originally staged at Dance Theatre Workshop in London, and was immensely successful. As a result, a production was planned at the Vineyard theatre in 1995. Then the world changed. Timothy McVeigh blew up an FBI building in Oklahoma, killing hundreds of people, including children. Prior to this, it was seen as what it was – a satire – and people were able to laugh. Back then, at least in the US, terrorism wasn’t something that really touched us on a regular basis. Once we were faced with the reality, the play could not be received in the same way. Suddenly this social satire became really scary. There would have been more backlash if more people saw it, but few came because it was so badly reviewed. It’s never been redone. I was sued by someone who claimed I had stolen his idea at a reading, but he didn’t realise my show had been staged a whole year before his reading. And why would I steal an idea that’s gone so badly? But the strangest thing was I started getting prank phonecalls from this German man who said he had seen the play, loved it, and was writing a PhD on theatre of cruelty. We began discussing it and then in a whisper he said: “Have you ever been spanked on the derrière with a ping-pong paddle?” And I was like: “Excuse me?” I hung up but he kept calling me for six months. ‘It was supposed to be comic!’ April De Angelis on A Laughing Matter (2002) There aren’t many jobs where you can have 10 or so people publicly saying things about something you hold dear, something you have spent your whole life doing. But the only way a playwright ever learns is to write a play and put it on. I wrote A Laughing Matter in 2002. It was a play about David Garrick, the 18th-century theatrical all-rounder, putting on Oliver Goldsmith’s She Stoops to Conquer. The idea was that Out of Joint would tour Goldsmith’s play and have a new play written to accompany it. I decided to write a story of how She Stoops to Conquer came to be. It was originally refused by Garrick because he felt it was too crude. It had good audiences, but it just didn’t get well reviewed. One critic – actually it was the Guardian’s Michael Billington – said it was an inaccurate rendering of Garrick’s life, even though it was never meant to be accurate. It was supposed to be comic! We don’t know the facts, he never wrote his life down. And why can’t you write a slightly imagined history? I think I’ve written good plays and bad plays. The good tend to survive, the bad don’t. This was the only play where I’d put my hand on my heart and say: “That’s a good play, that should survive.” And it hasn’t. Any writer can tell you every bad thing that’s been written about them. I went through a phase of going: “I’m not reading the reviews.” But then I’d just grab my phone and ask: “What are they saying?” We need critics and sometimes bad comments are justified, but that one I just couldn’t. I’m still cross. ‘Web critics got it. Broadsheet ones didn’t’ Anthony Neilson on Narrative (2013) Our idea of stories is evolving in the digital age. I have increasingly started to feel like the 90-minute, hermetically sealed classical structure of a play now feels quite odd. It doesn’t have the same kind of pulse as life. I think my show Narrative was a reasonably successful attempt at changing the mainstream. It was performed upstairs at the Royal Court in London, and a lot of the younger web critics really got it but the old-school broadsheet ones didn’t. I don’t think it was some genius, amazing work, but it opened a dialogue that was worth having. And that’s all I want to do: think about what a mainstream new form of narrative might be in theatre. Something that moves in a different way and will make sense to people 20 or 50 years from now. If you look at the history of film, it changes somewhat in terms of people’s cognition. It has some feeling of response. I don’t see the same things happening in theatre, which means that 20 or 30 years down the line when this demographic – who the industry is so eager to cater for and who can afford to pay £100 for a ticket – is gone, I’m not sure where they’re going to get their audiences from. I’m finding myself pretty disillusioned by theatre. You can only make lots of money if you’re prepared to write adaptations of films. Risk is not rewarded and that’s going to lead to a point where we’re not really looking for different ways to tell those stories on stage. The artform is going to atrophy.
177	Few musicians can claim to have invented a revolutionary rhythm, but then few are quite like the late Afrobeat pioneer Tony Allen. Brian Eno called him “the greatest drummer that ever lived”, citing his style alongside James Brown’s funk breakbeat and the constant pulse of German band Neu! as the “three great beats of the 1970s”. Allen’s swirl of jazz, Yoruba and highlife was unlike anything the world had ever heard: a full-body polyrhythmic workout that would give most drummers sore wrists just thinking of it. Allen came to prominence in Lagos alongside Fela Kuti. He started drumming in the late 50s while working at a radio station, looking to jazz icons such as Art Blakey and Max Roach for inspiration as he taught himself to play. In 1964 he met Kuti and they spent the next half-decade fine-tuning their fusion of west African party music and American funk and jazz, in the bands Koola Lobitos and, by 1969, Africa ’70. While Kuti, who died in 1997, is more well-known than his musical soulmate, he said that “without Tony Allen there would be no Afrobeat”. Allen has always said he didn’t invent Afrobeat per se, but his drumming was the genre’s backbone. He was a machine behind the kit, his method providing the foundation for Kuti’s fancies. Allen’s was a physical, multi-limbed approach. He thought drumming should be akin to “riding a bicycle”, as he told the Wire magazine. “You have to use your four limbs,” he said, which was “very rare” among drummers when he was starting out: “Maximum was three.” It’s little wonder Kuti said that Allen did the work of five drummers, though Allen went one further. “When I’m in a happy mood playing, you can hear me like six drummers,” he said in one interview. “On some days it could be 100!” Guardian critic Robin Denselow called his style “constantly inventive yet never flashy … dominant, but never intrusive.” Although perhaps Allen would disagree with the flashy part – he once told Clash magazine: “I want people to hear my drums, I want my drums to sound like a piano. You have to hear different things at the same time, like a chord.” For Allen, music was the most important message. He became notorious for his all-night sessions at Kuti’s club, the Shrine, where Brazilian legends Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso, South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela and even Stevie Wonder would show up to jam. When Kuti’s compound Kalakuta Republic was raided by armed troops in 1977, Allen was on stage at the Shrine, lost in the groove. A year later, frustrated by Kuti’s increasingly erratic behaviour (you name it: his 27 wives, paranoia, political agitation, refusal to pay his band members), he quit Africa ’70 and went his own way. He briefly relocated to London and then, in the mid-80s, to France, where he spent the first few years kicking a heroin habit. Throughout the 90s he kept working: as a session player for the likes of Kid Creole and the Coconuts, and Manu Dibango. But by the end of the decade, Allen had come into his own. At the turn of the millennium, France was credited as “bringing back Afrobeat” and creating “the future of fusion”. The producers and selectors that he met in Paris, such as Frederic Galliano and particularly Doctor L, stoked his experimental spirit. On his 1999 album Black Voices, Allen teamed up with Doctor L to bring dub and electronica into the fray. They worked together again on 2001’s Psyco on Da Bus. Meanwhile the UK Afro-centric reissue label Strut released his first four albums: Jealousy (1975), Progress (1977), No Accommodation for Lagos (1979) and No Discrimination (1979). From there, Allen entered the pop fray, working with French electro-pop artist Sébastien Tellier on the album Politics, and its standout song La Ritournelle, and Charlotte Gainsbourg in 2007. Allen worked with artists as varied as Detroit techno innovator Jeff Mills, Malian singer Oumou Sangaré, South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela, Grace Jones and Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers. But his best-known musical partnership since Kuti came with Damon Albarn. The Blur singer namechecked him on the band’s 2000 track Music Is My Radar (“Tony Allen really got me dancing”) and the pair struck up a kinship that lasted a decade, on The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen’s eponymous 2007 album and again for 2018’s Merrie Land. As with Kuti, Allen has said that the supergroup’s music was written after he had supplied his drum patterns; he also joined Albarn’s travelling cohort of contemporary and trad African musicians, Africa Express, in 2012. There is no doubt Allen was intrigued by the music of the future, but he was also fervent about keeping the spirit of Afrobeat alive and passing his knowledge on to the next generation. Memorably, he hosted a drumming masterclass with Moses Boyd, one of the young leading lights of the UK’s (Afrobeat-indebted) jazz scene in what could be perceived as a symbolic passing of the baton. Until 79, he seldom stopped playing, nor did he lose his interest in new music, with a voraciousness that puts his peers to shame. As recently as last month, Allen had said that his plans for 2020 had included working on an album with young musicians across Nigeria, London, Paris and the US to “bring them on my beat”. That he will no longer share that groundbreaking beat with the world is a devastating blow: Allen traversed scenes and sounds, bringing disparate music fans under his hypnotic groove. It felt like he’d be around to continue doing that for a good while longer. His life is testament to the great physicality of live music and to keeping curiosity alive. “I don’t want to be stagnant or bored,” Allen said. Life is about “evolution”. As with those impossibly long sets at the Shrine, where he would play for a bladder-twisting six hours with no breaks, Allen just kept going.
178	As of 30 April, Vietnam has a coronavirus death count of zero and only 270 cases. While the mortality numbers climb into the hundreds of thousands across the world, Vietnam has managed to contain the outbreak of coronavirus through timeliness, aggressive infection control, mass mobilisation of its population and an unprecedented level of openness. Out of the key factors that contributed to Vietnam’s successful coronavirus response, timeliness was the first. Vietnam acted early and did not hesitate to alert its citizens. On 28 January, when the country recorded only two cases, the government announced that it was planning for a scenario in which thousands of people could contract the virus. In the following weeks, Vietnam continuously imposed restrictions and issued policies ahead of and sometimes against the WHO’s recommendations, such as a series of international travel bans and the compulsory wearing of face masks. In late January, the WHO was advising against international traffic restrictions – and to this day, it still stands by the recommendation that face masks are not necessary for the general public. Due to limited treatment infrastructures, the Vietnamese government has focused on mass testing and aggressive contact tracing – a tactic it had employed to fight Sars 17 years ago. Only this time on a larger scale. As of 30 April, Vietnam had conducted 261,004 tests and put tens of thousands of people in isolation. Testing and contact tracing is based on a four-level principle announced by the health ministry: confirmed Covid-19 patients and their direct contacts (level 1: isolation and treatment in hospitals); close contacts with level 1 (level 2: quarantine facilities); close contacts with level 2 (level 3: self-quarantine at home); and lockdown of the neighbourhood/village/town where the patient lives (level 4). Adhering to this principle has meant testing a massive number of suspected cases for every new patient. So far, Vietnam has tested nearly 800 people for each new confirmed case, the highest ratio in the world, according to Reuters data. Vietnam was able to make its own test kits and has even exported the kits to Europe and the US. In real life, this scale of testing is easier said than done. Vietnam has gone to great lengths to locate the virus, even utilising methods that could have been controversial in countries with stricter privacy rights. It publishes a detailed travel history of every new patient on social media and in local newspapers in order to seek people who have been in close contact with them. To increase vigilance, the government has also released a mobile app for people to alert the authority about suspected infections in their area. For all people entering the country, a health declaration is now compulsory, with criminal penalties for false declarations. Some would claim these measures are intrusive and would doubt their effectiveness if implemented elsewhere. This may be true. Vietnam is a one-party state with decades of experience in mobilising its population through wars, Sars and swine flu outbreaks. In the early days of the epidemic, the government framed the outbreak as a war. Doctors and nurses were referred to as “soldiers”, and the newly formed National Steering Committee for Covid-19 Prevention and Control was dubbed the “General Headquarters” – a reference back to a military body in existence until 1975. Not only has the language of war been revived, the military has been central to tackling the outbreak. It has been in charge of coordinating the food, transport and accommodation required to quarantine thousands of people returning home to Vietnam from outbreak zones such as the UK. As in wartime, almost every sector, including aviation, healthcare and food production, has been mobilised and dedicated to containing the pandemic. Citizens, meanwhile, are encouraged via social media, text messages and TV broadcasts to donate to the nation’s disease prevention funds. These messages have not been communicated in a rigid militaristic style. Instead, the government has been creative. It updates citizens via regular text messages and has teamed up with two famous pop singers to produce an educational song about the virus, commissioned artists to create posters, and used young, influential figures to broadcast positive messages to those under mandatory quarantine. These creative messages have resonated with many living in lockdown. Vu Dinh Thai, a 25-year-old Vietnamese graduate student in the UK, spent nearly a month in the government’s quarantine camp. Despite unhygienic water and limited access to the internet, he was grateful for the safety he couldn’t be assured of in the UK. “It’s free and they tried their best,” he told me via text messages, “and who would belittle their country for being poor?” Vietnam made it clear at the beginning of the pandemic that it wanted to protect its reputation as “a safe country”. Yet by being open with its people, the government has achieved more than just safeguarding its image; it has rebuilt public trust. For the past few years, Vietnam has had to deal with protests over non-transparent handling of environmental disasters such as a mass fish poisoning in 2016, land disputes, and most recently a controversial bill of special economic zones. The question is whether Vietnam can retain this level of transparency in the aftermath of the crisis. Respecting and being open with the people can only benefit Vietnam. • Trang Bui is a Vietnamese freelance journalist based in Ho Chi Minh City • This article was amended on 3 May 2020.

179	Who is the so-called bubble policy for, exactly? I first heard about it when it floated out of Belgium a couple of weeks ago. The idea is that the end of lockdown would start with everyone being allowed to socialise once a week, in groups of up to 10 (although it would always have to be the same group). This is separate, by the way, to the idea that burst, rather surprisingly, out of Switzerland a week later – that since children under 10 were not considered infectious, adults should be allowed to hug them. Brilliant idea. You could just park a nine-year-old in the street, and everyone would hug it. “But what if they don’t want to be hugged?” said my niece in horror, and I was all: “Chill, you’re 12.” The Belgian idea, on the other hand, sounded genuinely mad. Until, that is, it turned out that, after it was pre-briefed, or semi-briefed, to the media, it is also to be our own government’s bright idea. I am way past the point of being able to tell which rumour is true. But it seems safest to assume that the worst possible thing is the one that will happen, so we could soon need to start arranging ourselves in units of 10. I was talking to a friend about it (honestly, I was not sizing her up, but since you mention it, at a family size of three, with good age-compatibility across the generations, they wouldn’t be a bad fit if they lived in the same town). “I’d have to have my own family in the group,” she said. I thought about this for a bit. I would happily gatecrash her wider family. But why’s that her choice? “I’d never make anyone’s 10,” she said. “Of course you would.” “I wouldn’t. Nobody ever calls me.” “I’m calling you right now.” A pause. I pressed on: “You can be in my 10.” A really long pause. “Wait,” I said. “You don’t want to be in my 10?” Another goddamn pause! “I can’t believe you! You’re not worried about rejection at all. You’re worried that you won’t be in with the in-crowd!” “I can’t help it. I am what I am.” So how might it work? If you were single, you would be powerfully aware that you are an odd number, so you would be thrashing around for another, indispensable single person to attach yourself to. Your whole life would turn into that painful, endgame phase in a game of musical chairs. If you were a couple without children, perhaps you might know four similar couples, who you are both equally fond of, and perhaps they might all like each other as much as you like them. And perhaps you might have tested these propositions by holidaying with one another in the past, which only deepened your mutual affections. Perhaps you are not real people at all; you are the brainchild of a junior scriptwriting collective, and you live in Netflixania, and one of you is neurotic and another is kooky, but that definitely doesn’t annoy anybody. Add children and you are starting off as a unit of at least three; you probably only have room for one other household, maximum two. This looming decision-making reminds me of Brexit circa 2018, the effort of compromise driving everyone toward their least-preferred option. It’s all about the maths. Or the physics, I can’t remember which. I have a lot of buried referendum trauma. “There’s no democratic way of doing this,” says my Mr, authoritatively . What happens when we exhaust democracy in our house is known as Dictator for the Day. It’s a parenting thing for siblings who can’t get on. You stop trying to make them agree on a dinner menu, or the order in which they are to have a bath; you just make one of them dictator, on the understanding that one of the others will be dictator the next day. The kids just use it as cover to persecute one another (“But that’s what a dictator would do”; “The dictator is a metaphor”; “If you were being metaphorical, you should have said”). But my Mr and I use it quite a lot between ourselves when we can’t agree on a film. Obviously, because we’re adults, we can never remember who was dictator the last time round, so we always end up watching The Long Good Friday. But it wouldn’t work in the bubble context, because it would be Dictator for an Unknown Number of Months. Is there even a point in forcing the decision? We could just wait to see who chooses us to be in their group. And it might be nobody, because we are quite wearing to be around, what with all the sporadic, metaphorical totalitarianism. I could see by my Mr’s eyebrows that he was giving up on the bubble. “You know what I like?” he said. “I like a Zoom.” “You hate a Zoom.” “It’s a totally different experience of friendship. Nobody talks over each other …” “Nobody talks, everyone just asks questions. It’s like being friends with a pub quiz machine.” “Ah, the quizzes. I love a Zoom quiz.” “Sincerely, you hate a Zoom quiz.” “Remember that time your brother photographed mainstream chocolate bars in cross section and we had to guess which ones they were?” “I do remember. One of them was a fish finger. You said it was immoral.” Having to chat on a sub-optimal platform is hardly the cruellest adjustment of the age. But I dearly want to hug my friends – all of them, non-hierarchically and in no particular order, totally unpoliced and uninhibited – a limitless number of times. “What you need,” said my beloved, “is 10 under-10s.”
180	The books industry needs to “wake up to the world beyond the M25”, according to a new report into the under-representation of British working-class writers, which lays out a damning indictment of the “pervasive barriers” in their way today. The report, Common People: Breaking the Glass Ceiling in UK Publishing, draws on evidence from the 17 working-class writers chosen for last year’s Common People anthology, along with industry experts. Published on Friday to mark International Workers’ Day, it says that the full range of voices in British society “is neither heard nor acknowledged in UK publishing” and that aspiring, working-class writers are at a disadvantage when trying to get a publishing deal. Barriers cited include a lack of support networks and contacts, lower levels of self-confidence and the publishing industry’s lack of social diversity. Novelist Jessica Andrews, who wrote her 2019 debut Saltwater because she worried that the stories of working-class people were “slipping away”, said the most difficult part of writing for her was self-doubt. “When I was writing my first novel, I learned to constantly push back against the fear that my experiences were trivial and uninteresting, or were not ‘poetic’ or ‘literary’ enough, and that is because I had rarely seen a life like mine represented in literary fiction,” said Andrews, who won the Portico prize for the novel. An anonymous writer interviewed for the report highlighted the difference between their experience and that of a fellow author, who “got his publishing deal through a friend of a friend, he got a newspaper column through a friend of a friend, he got on Radio 4 through a friend of a friend”. “When I spoke with him about his career development it was just like watching somebody on the ski slopes when you’ve never learned to ski,” said the writer. “Off they go with all their friends, whizz whizz whizz and you’re still stood at the edge wondering how to strap on the ski boots.” The report’s author Katy Shaw, professor of contemporary writings at Northumbria University, writes that “there has never been a more vital point at which working-class stories and voices needed to be heard in mainstream culture”. After years of reports damning the publishing industry for its overwhelmingly middle-class and white workforce, publishers including Penguin Random House have launched schemes to find and publish writers from under-represented communities, while agencies like the Good Literary Agency, which is committed to representing writers from marginalised groups, have been successfully established. But the Common People project calls for “even greater reform”, with key recommendations including moving publishing’s focus away from London, through new public and private investment in launching more publishing ventures and writing development agencies outside the capital. More diversity among agents, editors and publishers was also stressed as key. “We are past the time for listening and now we need some action,” said novelist Kit de Waal, who edited the Common People anthology. De Waal used some of the advance from her first book to establish a writing scholarship for people from disadvantaged backgrounds at Birkbeck, University of London. “The publishing industry – and the UK government – still needs to wake up to the world beyond the M25. It needs to diversify its workforce and do more than say ‘we’re listening’,” De Waal writes in a foreword to the report. “It is vital that the Common People project does not stand alone and become a piece of history. This research and its findings and recommendations need to be the beginning of something bigger and better, a living breathing thing that continues to change lives for creatives and the creative industries in the UK.” Labour MP Jon Trickett welcomed the report as “a counterweight to the over-representation of establishment voices in British cultural life”. “Every day I am continually delighted to encounter the unrecognised talent, wisdom, intelligence and creativity of working people. We all lose out, if we fail to hear their voices,” said Trickett. The Common People project was launched by New Writing North and Writing West Midlands in 2018 and is the first ever joint research project between all seven UK regional writing development agencies.
181	A head of procurement for the NHS has set up a business to profit from the private sale of huge quantities of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, an undercover investigation by the Guardian can reveal. David Singleton, 42, a senior NHS official in London who has been working at the capital’s Covid-19 Nightingale hospital, launched the business two weeks ago to trade in visors, masks and gowns. Asked about the findings of the investigation, Singleton said he disclosed his business to superiors in the NHS, in accordance with the rules, and was told there was “unlikely to be a conflict”. However, the NHS launched an immediate investigation. “We take any potential conflicts of interest extremely seriously and as soon we became aware of these allegations an internal investigation was started,” a spokesperson said. A website for Singleton’s company, Sure Stock, which marketed PPE to private sector and NHS clients, made no reference to Singleton or his role in the health service. But in a phone call with an undercover reporter posing as a potential client, Singleton confirmed he was running the business. He said he was trading as a “sales agent” between suppliers and buyers of PPE. According to Singleton’s LinkedIn profile, which he deleted shortly after the Guardian told him about its investigation, he is a head of procurement for the NHS in London. He works within a large commissioning support unit (CSU) that covers the capital’s north and east and surrounding areas. It is understood the investigation is being conducted by his employer, the NHS north and east London CSU. During the conversation with the undercover reporter, Singleton said he was “currently an NHS employee” but said his role did not involve buying “any products”. “I deliver services,” he said. “So none of the suppliers that I’m working with do I have any interactions with during my day job.” Asked later whether he was exploiting his NHS expertise and contacts, Singleton said in a statement that he was not “directly involved” in responding to the PPE shortage in the NHS “as my role does not involve purchasing or procuring of these products”. However, information collated by the Guardian, including internal NHS email evidence, suggests Singleton may have been involved in procuring PPE supplies. Asked to respond to a request for comment about the email evidence, Singleton replied “no comment” and hung up the phone. The NHS declined to comment on the email evidence. Singleton created his PPE company on 15 April, as the shortage of protective equipment for NHS and other health and care workers working on the frontline of the coronavirus outbreak was reaching crisis point. His company, Sure Stock Limited, originally registered to Singleton’s home in Essex, launched a website that same week, marketing PPE products for “medical, dental, adult social care, the food industry and personal use”. The website offered large amounts of PPE and hygiene products for sale, including protective face shields, or “smart visors”, which were priced at £19,500 for minimum orders of 10,000 units. Posing as an agent for a meat processing factory, a Guardian reporter approached Sure Stock claiming his client urgently needed large quantities of PPE to protect about 800 workers and return the facility to full production. Sure Stock’s salesperson, a friend and associate of Singleton, confirmed the company had been created by Singleton and said he could help source batches of 20,000 visors, masks, gowns and gloves – as well as 1,000 litres of hand sanitiser – as part of an initial order. The sale would have totalled more than £100,000. The salesperson told the undercover reporter: “Essentially a friend of mine is head of procurement for NHS London. He has really struggled to get stuff to people in the right timeframe. So essentially what we decided to do was set up a little company and become sales agents for people in the UK who have got stock. And then essentially we would help in linking up the supply chains that are massively disastrous at the moment.” The undercover reporter then asked to talk to Singleton directly. During a 40-minute telephone conversation, Singleton told the undercover reporter: “What we do is we work with the supplier and then our margin, our commission, our referral, comes from them before the prices go out. So we just work as a sales agent.” He also disclosed he was an NHS employee. “We want to nurture relationships like yours. Because people like you can open doors for some of my suppliers into areas that they don’t currently reach into,” he told the undercover reporter. “So it’s growing a network of trusted suppliers and buyers because you can’t be a supplier unless you’ve got a buyer. You can’t be a buyer unless you’ve got a supplier. You need to have these things. You need to connect up.” Towards the end of the call, Singleton emphasised how competitive his visor prices were and encouraged the undercover reporter to “piggyback” a large order “currently … going through with the Far East [and a UK importer]”. He added: “What I’d close off by saying is when you are in a position where you know you want to place an order, rest assured that you are going to be dealing with a UK company.” Singleton told the undercover reporter that during the Covid-19 outbreak he had been “redeployed” to the Nightingale hospital at the Excel Centre and the Royal London hospital and was “helping them set up their pop-up ITU [intensive treatment unit] wards and their stock rooms”. In his statement to the Guardian following the undercover investigation, Singleton said he had not set up ITUs or stock rooms and had not been involved in any procurement at the the hospital. He said he had notified his employer about Sure Stock, as is required, and had been informed by a superior that “there is unlikely to be a conflict”, as it was perceived there would be no crossover in terms of customers. Singleton said declaring the directorship was the main step towards compliance and this had been completed. However, the Guardian understands that while Singleton recently declared his new business via an internal online NHS reporting system, the disclosure was under review and had not yet been approved. In his conversation with the undercover reporter, Singleton’s salesperson appeared to give conflicting accounts of whether or not the firm planned to market to the NHS. At one point he said: “We’re not really wanting to approach anyone in the NHS, because there is a bit of conflict of interest, so we are sort of staying out of that.” But during another part of the conversation, about the scarcity of gowns on the market, the salesperson said: “We’ve got a lot of NHS trusts frantically phoning around trying to get hold of these and they can’t.” He added: “Now what we are doing with those, we are offering the NHS 30 days to pay.” In his emailed statement, Singleton said Sure Stock “has not and will not sell PPE and related equipment to the NHS, or any NHS organisation”. He added: “Any such allegation is false”. However, a photograph on Sure Stock’s website advertising face shields showed a visor with the NHS logo printed on the front, and the company offered deals for NHS clients. “For our NHS heroes your price is fixed!” the website stated. In his statement, Singleton said the face shields have not been sold to the NHS because they did not meet the complex medical devices regulations which govern the manufacture and supply of such products. Sure Stock’s website was mothballed shortly after Singleton was contacted by the Guardian for comment. It now just states: “Coming soon”.
246	The US supreme court may be the highest in the land, but because of the small number of cases it hears each year, justice usually does not get that far. Final rulings in the vast majority of federal lawsuits are issued one tier lower, in the 13 appeals courts spread across the country. And this is now where key policy questions increasingly land, because partisanship has slowed legislative dealmaking in the United States in recent years. It is in these appeals courts where judges serving lifetime appointments have extraordinary power over issues as public as the climate crisis and as private as the right to choose. That longer-term trend has converged with a much more recent development: Donald Trump’s appointment of a record number of appeals court judges installed with unprecedented speed, as part of a grand project coordinated with conservative legal activists to remake the federal bench for generations to come. Nearly 30% of the 179 active circuit court judges are now Trump appointees. Owing to this extraordinary push, the ideological makeup of the courts has slowly tipped in a conservative direction. Since 2017, three of the courts have “flipped” from a majority of judges appointed by a Democratic president to a Republican-appointment majority. The US court of appeals for the eleventh circuit, which oversees cases in Florida, Alabama and Georgia, has gone from an 8-3 majority of judges appointed by Democrats, with one vacancy, to a 7-5 majority of judges appointed by Republicans. Elsewhere, Trump has “flipped” the second and third Circuits, and he has effectively flipped a fourth court, the ninth circuit, some analysts think. “I still like to think there’s a bottom line for even conservative Trump appointees on the court of appeals, that there’s a line there that they won’t cross over, that we’ll remain a country of laws and not men,” said Sheldon Goldman, a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who focuses on the federal bench. “But who knows?” Together the ninth, eleventh and fifth circuit courts decide thousands of cases a year with broad repercussions for daily life in America. Here’s a look at how the three courts are changing under Trump. Eleventh circuit Florida, Georgia, Alabama Key issue: Who gets to vote Floridians struck a historic blow in favor of universal suffrage in the 2018 midterm elections, passing a constitutional amendment that restored the right to vote to felons who had completed their sentences. With a 30-point margin of victory, the will of the voters was unambiguous. But the reality of voting in Florida, a key presidential swing state, has been slow to change. Last May, the Republican-controlled legislature passed a law curtailing the right of felons to vote who owe money from legal penalties, significantly rolling back the 2018 referendum result. In reply, would-be voters sued the Republican governor, and now voting rights in Florida are in a very different place from where they seemed to be in November 2018. Instead of being before the electorate, the issue is before the federal courts, which means it is in the hands of judges appointed by Trump. In a ruling expected in the coming months, Trump’s judges could strip the right to vote from the 1.5 million people who had it restored in the 2018 referendum, in defiance of the popular will, potentially swaying the results of the November 2020 election, in a swing state that Trump needs to hold in order to return to the White House. “We had fears about what these jurists would do when they got on the bench, just from their records,” said Marge Baker, executive vice-president of People for the American Way (PFAW), which maintains a tracking tool of Trump’s judges called Confirmed Judges, Confirmed Fears. “This administration more than any has really been putting movement ideologues on the bench who have an agenda. And once we got far enough into the administration, we realized that the judges about whom we had fears were issuing decisions that were highly problematic.” Rulings by circuit courts, which average about 13 active judges each, are typically issued by randomly selected three-judge panels, meaning that the overall makeup of the court does not directly come into play in every ruling. Over time, however, the composite ideological orientation of a court comes through. And Trump’s judges on the eleventh circuit have shown what critics see as a hostility to a central issue for the state of Florida and the country: voting rights. The legal team representing voters in the Florida felony disenfranchisement case claims in part that the state law was passed with racial and discriminatory intent in violation of the constitution. “This issue of felony disenfranchisement is a really important issue in the United States,” said Sean Morales-Doyle, a Brennan Center lawyer who is litigating the case. “Florida’s voters came forward and really made clear that they rejected this, that this wasn’t a policy that voters on any part of the political spectrum believe in. And then we promptly saw the Florida legislature attempt to undo that.” Ninth circuit California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Hawaii, Montana, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona Key issue: Immigration Since Trump became president, the US court of appeals for the ninth circuit has gone from an 18-7 majority of active judges appointed by Democrats, with four vacancies, to a much narrower 16-13 majority of judges appointed by Democrats. But the court’s senior judges, who carry about half the caseload of active judges, also issue rulings – and at the senior level, Republican appointees now outnumber Democratic appointees 10-3. “Maybe it’s already flipped in some ways,” said Carl Tobias, a professor at Richmond School of Law specializing in federal judicial selection, of the ninth circuit. Whatever the balance on the bench, activists express concern about decisions coming down from the court, historically one of the most progressive in the country. Trump judges on the ninth circuit have been especially abrasive in immigration cases, denying spousal visas in violation of long precedent and dismissing asylum claims, including in a case where the plaintiff had evidence of murders of multiple family members in his home country. In one dissent, a Trump-appointed judge supported a Trump proclamation banning entry to any would-be immigrant who could not prove either possession of health insurance or an ability to pay for healthcare. The judge ruled that the government would “suffer immediate, irreparable harm” unless the health insurance screen was allowed to stand, quoting Trump on the “financial and public health burdens that the uninsured can impose”. Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who analyzes the shifting makeup of federal courts under Trump, said the ninth circuit had undergone “a big change” and noted that the outsized caseload of the circuit, the biggest in the country covering 60 million people, often required visiting judges to fill in. Fifth circuit Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi Key issue: healthcare Since Trump became president, the US court of appeals for the fifth circuit has gone from a 9-5 majority of active judges appointed by Republicans, with three vacancies, to an 11-5 majority of judges appointed by Republicans, with one vacancy. Trump judges on the circuit have boosted key administration projects, especially on immigration, greenlighting $3.6bn in spending on the border wall and taking a chilly view of asylum claims. They have issued rulings inimical to employment equality and fair housing claims, and protected law enforcement from liability for excessive use of force. In a case with ominous resonance under the coronavirus pandemic, the court has defended objections on religious grounds to immunizations. “It’s worth pointing out that four of the courts, the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth, had Republican-appointed majorities when Trump took office,” said Wheeler. “So he has perhaps strengthened the Republican-appointee majority on those courts by putting younger and perhaps ideologically more committed judges in the place of older Republicans.”
197	Before I start a column, I talk about it with a friend. They will ask idly, “How’s the writing going?” And when I’m not shrieking, “It’s not! It’ll never go!” because I am behind schedule, I test my ideas. This week I’d planned to write about the cats that pass through my garden and how, because the circumference of my life has contracted to the flat’s perimeter, a drop-in from these nimble-pawed visitors was the day’s excitement. Meanwhile, actual celebrities have lost all relevance: a seismic change for a millennial raised on the minutiae of strangers’ lives. I figured there was something in this, or in how owning a cat is a communal kindness. I hadn’t fleshed it out. But my friend seemed mortified by the idea. She’d heard that cats could spread the virus if an infected person touched their fur. I Googled it: there were no cases of this occurring, nor a reputable authority mentioning it. “It won’t age well,” she insisted, pointing to the two-week lag between writing and publishing. “By then, the government could have put cats in lockdown.” I confess I did briefly enjoy the mental image of the health secretary, Matt Hancock, flapping around, literally trying to herd kittens, but I felt my friend had a point. Not about the cats , but about time. Although it may feel slower and our world is smaller, we are, in fact, racing through it, like a pod through space, even if inside there’s just a pair of astronauts binge-eating freeze-dried cheese. Weeks contain a month’s events. Months are worthy of a history book. I have no idea what any of it means, other than having had enough of living through “historic” times. But I suspect I won’t easily forget how quickly everything can change, or how fast time can move. Best not to take the joys for granted, or to wait to do the things that make us happy. Cats may have nine lives, but I have only one.

199	It is easy to see why it could be thrilling fiction for our times: it has a mysterious and fatal virus, an epidemiologist hero, a desperate search for a vaccine and murky political skullduggery. It also features a green monkey. But whether it is the moment for Stanley Johnson, the father of Boris Johnson, to be pushing his 40-year-old novel for a new release is another question. Nonetheless, British publishers have been invited to consider reissuing Johnson senior’s 1982 thriller The Marburg Virus, the Guardian has learned. His agent is so convinced of his ability to effectively publicise a reissue that his pitch describes him as “a tireless self-promoter”. Long out of print, the book is based on a real disease outbreak in Germany in the late 1960s. Johnson denied being opportunistic in wanting his novel to be made available again. “I’m a professional writer,” he said. “Is it opportunistic for journalists and newspapers to be writing about the coronavirus?” He pointed to his previous thrillers which have also tackled contemporary issues, including his latest book Kompromat, which tells a story of devious Russian influence on western politics. Johnson said his novel had a prescience, in that the plot was driven by the desperate need to find a vaccine. “I don’t think the novel is far fetched because look at what is happening now,” he said. The novel is a pacy environmental and medical adventure story involving illegal animal traders, corrupt pharmaceutical company bosses, the KGB and a US president desperate to come out on top. In Johnson’s story, the equivalent of Wuhan is New York, the virus breaks out at the Bronx zoo. Soon the rest of the world bans planes travelling from the US. The main characters are involved in a desperate attempt to track down a rare breed of green monkey, which was the source of the virus. Some subplots are more improbable than others. One involves the Brazilian head of the World Health Organization and his deputy, a sinister, monocle-wearing Russian with an upper-class English accent, travelling to the Congo to personally oversee the destruction of monkeys responsible for the virus … or so they thought. Johnson said there were lessons to be learned from his story because he thought more effort should be being made today to tracking down the source of the current pandemic. “Instead of focusing on the Wuhan ‘wet’ market, I think people should be looking for some release of the virus via an animal being used in the secretive Wuhan research laboratory,” he said, in remarks echoing Donald Trump’s so far unsubstantiated claim to have seen evidence that the virus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. “Then of course the race will begin to find where the animal or batch of animals came from so that a world-saving vaccine can be developed in record time.” The pitch to UK publishers by Johnson’s literary agent, Jonathan Lloyd of Curtis Brown, urges publishers to purchase what he describes as “an unnervingly prophetic, intelligent thriller”. It continues: “When a young woman in New York City dies mysteriously after a trip to Europe, top epidemiologist Lowell Kaplan identifies the cause of death as the Marburg virus – a fatal strain that has surfaced only once before in history. “Determined to trace the source of the disease, Kaplan follows a trail of intrigue from the labs of Germany to the jungles of central Africa.” Lloyd is “looking for a publisher who can capitalise on the wonderful opportunity Stanley’s profile presents and make this urgent, exhilarating novel quickly available to his wide audience, at a time when it feels eerily prescient”, he writes. The pitch describes Johnson as “an excellent, tireless self-promoter” and it hopes publishers “can agree that this is an exciting opportunity to have this book back in print again (firstly as an e book)”. The book was published in the US in 2015 with the title The Virus but it remains to be seen whether UK publishers will bite. Johnson said Amazon was charging £57 for the paperback edition. “All the more reason to produce a new version now,” he said. “I do hope it happens … I had such fun writing it.” Reviews of the novel are sparse and mixed. On Goodreads coverage ranges from praise for its “breakneck action” to a less glowing response: “Made it about a third of the way through this before I got too annoyed with its stupidity and quit.” But another reader on the site noted the book’s possible prescience in 2015: “The scariest thing is, because we live in a scary world, I can totally envision every bit of it happening.” They also said they had received a copy directly from the author. ‘They made love in a brass four-poster bed’: extracts from The Marburg Virus Doctor Lowell Kaplan, Head of the Bureau of Epidemiology at the National Center for Disease Control at Atlanta, Georgia, was on the telephone to Japan. He sounded worried. He was worried. He pushed back a lock of thick greying hair which had fallen over his forehead and hunched forward as he spoke, the suppressed energy visible in every line of his body. “Okay,” he shouted into the phone. “It differs from A-Brazil, but does it have pandemic potential? That’s the question.” She pleaded with him. “Lowell, don’t go. Not now. I need you tonight.” They made love in a brass four-poster bed which Stephanie had bought in an antique shop off Les Halles when she first came to Paris. Kaplan stayed the night. They had breakfast in bed. Then, pushing the tray aside, they made love again. There was none of the urgency there had been the previous evening. It was though a dam had burst on a river. Now, after a temporary turbulence, the water was flowing smoothly again.” The President’s reaction, once he was informed of the crisis, was immediate. “Why in God’s name don’t we have a vaccine? You people” – he was addressing an emergency meeting of Federal and state health officials – “have a vaccine for polio and flu and whooping cough and even the goddam common cold. So why haven’t you got a vaccine for Marburg if it’s the deadliest disease known to man?”
200	Apart from the multiple kindnesses of friends and new-found neighbours, it’s hard to find a silver lining to the current situation, but one positive is having time to learn stuff you don’t know. In wine terms, that could be a country, a region or a grape variety, particularly one you may have failed to get to grips with in the past, and the immediate one that pops to my mind is riesling. Now, before you say you wine writers are always banging on about riesling, that’s true, but I wouldn’t go so far as to call it the greatest white wine grape in the world (for me, that’s chardonnay). It is, however, massively intriguing in the way it reflects the place where it’s made, its wildly varying levels of sweetness (no, it’s not all sweet) and its ability to age, which may mean that that elderly bottle you stumbled across at the back of the cupboard is, in fact, OK. Riesling also has the advantage of going brilliantly with spicy food and being relatively low in alcohol, which makes it perfect for this time of year. Part of the problem, of course, is that riesling is inextricably associated with Germany, so has to deal with the historic baggage between our two nations, though that’s mercifully dying out, and not before time. It’s also fair to say that the German wines exported here in the 60s and 70s – not always riesling, but often mistaken for it – were woefully poor. Add to that a bewildering labelling system (how can spätlese be both a dry and a sweet wine?), as well as tortuously complicated names and labels, and you can see why the stuff fell so out of favour. But German rieslings have changed: these days, they’re drier, higher in alcohol (many Mosel wines are now 11% or 11.5%, rather than 8-9%) and, in many cases, snappily packaged, as you can see from the Shhh… It’s Riesling in the panel below. And, hooray, sealed with a screw-cap rather than a cork. You also find great riesling in Alsace, Austria and in the new world in Australia, New Zealand and North America’s Washington State. The most rewarding ones, as usual, are to be found in independents such as The Winery, or online retailers such as The Wine Society, which has just started delivering again, though at time of writing only by the unsplit case. These supermarket rieslings should at least give you a taste for it, however. Who knows, you might even be able to convert the neighbours… Five rieslings to try on your own (or drink with friends on Zoom) Shhh… It’s Riesling 2019 £6 Co-op, 11.5%. I’ve been warned that there are limited quantities of this crisp, citrussy, dry riesling with its beguiling whiff of green granny smith apple, so grab one if you see it. I like a bottle that pokes gentle fun at itself. Riesling Scheurebe Halbtrocken 2018 £5.99 Lidl, 11.5%. A good buy from Lidl’s latest ‘Wine Tour’ release, which focuses on riesling. Deliciously fruity but, as the word halbtrocken indicates, off-dry. Would stand up well to an Indian, Thai or Chinese takeaway. (Lidl’s lively, limey Clare Valley Riesling at £6.99 is a good buy, too.) Specially Selected Alsace Riesling 2018 £6.99 Aldi, 12%. A well-priced example of the drier style you find in Alsace. Would be perfect with creamy sauces or an onion tart. Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference Austrian Riesling 2018 £8.75, 12.5%. Austria also produces drier, less floral rieslings than Germany – a good starting point, if you’re new to riesling. Lovely with a schnitzel or, more realistically, a breaded chicken fillet. Fritz Willi Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium 2018 £11.25 Rannoch Scott, £12.95 The Secret Bottle Shop, 11%. An altogether more elegant affair, seductively rounded, with a lovely touch of honey and lime. I’m thinking salmon, if you have some. • For more by Fiona Beckett, go to matchingwineandfood.com
201	UK businesses borrowed record sums in March, while consumers cleared £3.8bn of debt, according to figures from the Bank of England that show firms and individuals “battened down the hatches” as the coronavirus crisis hit. The Bank said £34.1bn of loans had been advanced to firms during the month, the highest figure since records began in 1998. The figures include new lending made under the government’s coronavirus business interruption loan scheme and the Bank’s term funding scheme, put in place to support businesses during the crisis. The annual rate of growth in borrowing by UK businesses rose to 8.2%, and within this borrowing by large businesses rose sharply, to 11.8%. Deposits held by businesses rose by £34bn over the same period, and the Bank said changes in deposits and loans correlated closely across industries. Meanwhile, new borrowing on credit cards and loans plummeted. New lending fell by £5.4bn over the month, resulting in the highest level of repayments recorded by the Bank since it started tracking the figures in 1987. Credit card spending was down by 0.3% year-on-year – the first time the Bank has recorded an annual drop. The fall is likely to be a reflection of the huge fall in consumer spending since physical distancing measures were introduced and households began to avoid shopping and leisure activities, rather than a sign that households are actively clearing debt. Deposits held in bank accounts leapt by £13.1bn, despite falling interest rates. The Bank also noted a £1.3bn fall in repayments during the month, which could be a result of payment holidays being offered by banks and credit card providers to those who incomes have reduced by the crisis. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Economics, said the figures showed “that private-sector demand for cash surged in March, as businesses and households battened down the hatches. “Data for April will provide a clear steer on whether businesses are collapsing, though March’s figures are tentatively encouraging.” The Bank also reported a drop in the number of mortgages approved by lenders, with loans for both purchases and remortgages falling in March. The number of house purchase loans fell by 24% to 56,200 – the lowest level for seven years, while the number of remortgages was its lowest since August 2016, at 42,600. In February, house purchase loans had hit a seven-year high and the market appeared to be geared for a year of rising activity and prices. But it was, in effect, suspended in late March after ministers told would-be movers to delay their moves where possible. An estimated 373,000 sales are on hold. The UK’s biggest building society, Nationwide, said on Friday the housing market was “grinding to a halt” and warned it might not be able to produce its regular house price index over the coming months if there were too few transactions. The lender reported a 0.7% increase in UK house prices in April, but said that 80% of the deals in its sample related to mortgage applications that started before the lockdown, and before the full extent of the impact of the pandemic became clear. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said the medium-term outlook for the housing market was “highly uncertain”, with much depending on the performance of the wider economy. “Economic activity is set to contract significantly in the near term as a direct result of the necessary measures adopted to suppress the spread of the virus,” he said. “But the raft of policies adopted to support the economy, including to protect businesses and jobs, to support peoples’ incomes and keep borrowing costs down, should set the stage for a rebound once the shock passes, and help limit long-term damage to the economy.” Hansen Lu, a property economist at Capital Economics, said the rise in house prices would not last, and predicted a 4% drop over the year. “House prices are sticky – buyers may be seeking discounts in light of uncertainty and the economic hit from the pandemic, but owners won’t accept unless forced to by worsening economic circumstances,” he said. “This suggests that while house prices may appear resilient in the short term, as the economic hit from the pandemic continues, some owners will be forced to accept price cuts eventually.”
202	When Campwell opened for the first time on 14 February, the outlook was bright – despite the horrendous weather. The woodland eco-site near Bath may have been lashed by storm Dennis but it was full that first weekend and forward bookings were “fantastic”’ according to founder Tim Bowles: “It was really positive – we were already beyond our targets in terms of bookings and thinking we might even make a profit.” Just over a month later, the UK went into lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic and, like every other tourism business in the country, Bowles shut up shop. The outlook for his inaugural season went from bright to bleak. “It hasn’t been an ideal start,” Bowles said, although he admits he’s more fortunate than some. His landlord is a friend who is flexible about rent and two supervisors he employs have other work they can fall back on. But even without the pressure of meeting those costs, Bowles says it’s impossible for him to refund all his customers without putting the fledging business at risk. “Most customers have been very accommodating and agreed to reschedule. We have refunded some people, but if we refunded everyone we would be on our knees.” “There’s a lot of talk on social media about how evil businesses are for not giving a refund, but it’s important to remember that these are small business that are dependent on these bookings – we are a very seasonal business and half our season has already been erased,” added Bowles. He says he “appreciates other people are going through financial difficulty too,” but the timing of the crisis, coming at the beginning of the season, has been “brutal.” Unlike Airbnb, which announced full refunds or credits for guests who booked before 14 March (for stays up to 31 May) – a decision that hit individual owners hard – few small independent businesses have cash reserves to fall back on. In the first few months of the year, owners often use deposits to refurbish accommodation ready for the new season, so most have little money in the bank, and some are in debt. Easter bookings are relied on to inject some cash into the business. Mary and Simon Sparrow, owners of Hippersons Boatyard, a collection of four houseboats and a glamping pod in Suffolk, invested in a second pod this year to increase capacity for the 2020 season, leaving them with no financial cushion. “People think we have loads of money behind us but we don’t. We are now trying to plan ahead financially and considering cashing in our pensions.” This year, Alistair Handyside, owner of Higher Wiscombe in south-east Devon, a collection of three cottages, invested £200,000 in the largest one. “One week later, we went into lockdown and the business stopped dead,” he said. “In 15 years of running a business, we’ve had three cancellations. On 23 March, we had 16, so this is on a scale that is unprecedented.” Handyside has already lost £80,000 in deferred business; if he is unable to accommodate guests in July and August that will rise to £140,000. “Good businesses do not want to see customers missing out. If customers are being offered a full-value credit at a reasonable time – in other words, a fair swap, that is helping that business survive on really thin wages,” said Handyside, who is also chair of the Professional Association of Self-Caterers (Pasc). In a survey of 900 accommodation owners in the south-west conducted by Pasc and the South West Tourism Alliance, 80% said they would collapse if they had no income through this summer, despite some of them receiving a grant of £10,000 and the prospect of government-backed rescue loans. For Handyside, the biggest frustration has been the failure of insurers to pay out. “Most owners have business interruption insurance, but insurers are refusing coverage,” he said. “It’s probably going to be one of the big scandals of Covid-19.” The problem is being compounded by the failure of guests’ holiday insurance. Many holidaymakers are being told it’s up to their accommodation provider to compensate them, so holiday-home owners are becoming the “insurer of last resort”. The “insurance scandal”, as Handyside puts it, has left small businesses between a rock and a hard place. Many rely on repeat business from customers for the majority of bookings and do not want to jeopardise that loyalty but simply do not have the funds to refund everyone. Handyside said he is fortunate that his business is year-round, so there is a possibility of some recovery later in 2020, but seasonal businesses have already seen half their year wiped out. “It’s an absolute nightmare,” said Jacqueline Saggers who, with her husband, runs Guilden Gate, a smallholding in Hertfordshire with two glampsites. They have refused all refunds: “Not because we are being difficult but because we are a small family business and would go under if we did, and that doesn’t help anyone.” With only two sites, a VW van and a Hobbit-style shelter, she hasn’t even been able to give all guests the alternative dates they want because that would mean even more loss of income: “If we took everyone who’s cancelled and put them in July and August, we would have no income. We’re asking them to swap to September and October.” Adding “most guests are being very accommodating”. The Saggers have received a £10,000 government grant but “have to make it last” until they can start operating again. As to when that might be, there is no clear indication from the government yet. On 28 April, minister for the Cabinet Office, Michael Gove, announced that tourist hotspots will be off-limits “for some time to come”. Two days later, prime minister Boris Johnson told the daily briefing that it was important to “get tourism going again”, but not to the extent that “an influx of people would create a second wave of the disease”. Johnson said a “roadmap” for unlocking various parts of the economy will be revealed next week but “dates and times for each individual measure will be driven by where we are in the epidemic and what the data is saying”. Duncan Jordan, owner of Cambrian Escapes near Llandovery in Carmarthenshire, which had been running for just under a year when the crisis struck, said: “We’re working on the basis that the summer’s gone. We’re hoping it isn’t, but when you hear the news, the work that needs to go in to helping people accept visitors and incomers into the community is huge.” Others are more hopeful that tourism businesses will be able to operate at some level from July onwards. “The worst case scenario is being shut down and not being able to operate until next year,” said Malcom Bell, head of Visit Cornwall, a region where one in five jobs are in tourism and one in three homes depend in some way on the tourism sector. “What we need is not to open a day too early or a day too late – we have to get this right,” said Bell. “There will be compromises: how do you make sure businesses are compliant? How do you give customer and community assurance? And how you minimise any risk to visitors?” Measures currently being considered to ensure Cornwall can safely welcome visitors include timed-ticketing at attractions to control numbers, vehicle restrictions in towns to keep numbers of visitors at a manageable level, and even a change in the law requiring holidaymakers to have documentation proving they are allowed to visit. “These might be seen as draconian, but let’s not rule them out at the moment,” said Bell. “The alternative is to keep everything shut – but we have businesses in despair, it’s causing mental health issues. We have to come up with a solution to help the economy while minimising the risks to visitors and the community.” In the meantime, owners facing the potential loss of their livelihoods are trying to stay positive. “At the moment the land is heavenly. The wildlife is incredible,” said Jacqueline Saggers at Guilden Gate. “But I can’t wait to be able to share it again with guests.”
203	Welcome to this week’s roundup of developments in the coronavirus pandemic, as scientists continue to work on vaccine trials and the role of face masks for the public continues to be debated. In the US, President Donald Trump continues to cause consternation among scientists Trump, who previously shocked experts by suggesting injecting people with disinfectant could cure Covid-19 – a dangerous idea that scientists and doctors were quick to debunk – has now claimed to have seen “convincing evidence” that Covid-19 originated in Wuhan lab, contradicting his own government experts. Once again, the scientific community has swiftly rebutted Trump’s assertions. Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: “We have good evidence from the genomics research that the virus is not manmade, and the scientific world has very much moved on from this idea. It is unhelpful for high-profile individuals to repeat the debunked conspiracy theories, as it undermines the public health response”. There is cautious optimism around an experimental coronavirus drug There are signs the antiviral medicine remdesivir – which has previously been used in Ebola patients – may be a useful tool in helping those with Covid-19. While it is not a “cure”, a new trial has suggested it can reduce the recovery time of those seriously ill with the disease. Early results from an international trial of 1,000 participants reveal the drug cut recovery time from a median of 15 days to 11 and was also linked to a better chance of survival. The findings come after results from a smaller trial among patients in China, that was cut short, initially suggested the drug had little effect. “What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus,” said Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government’s top infectious disease expert. However experts have warned the drug is unlikely to be available widely in the UK any time soon, as it is very difficult to obtain, while they say the trial’s data must also be rigorously analysed and licensing approved. In the last edition of Science Weekly, Sarah Boseley talks to Prof Helen McShane about why there has been interest in the tuberculosis vaccine and whether it could play a role in protecting us against Covid-19 In the UK, face masks continue to be a hot topic Boris Johnson has said the UK has passed the peak in the outbreak and is planning to outline the country’s exit strategy next week. But the role of face masks for the general public remains contentious. This week, Boris Johnson said face coverings will be “useful” going forwards, suggesting they may give people confidence when going back to work, while Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the Scottish public should wear them in cases where it is difficult to maintain physical distancing, for example when shopping, although the guidance is not mandatory. However, she cautioned that people should not feel “invincible” when wearing a mask, or stop adhering to distancing guidelines. Experts have previously said that while wearing face masks in the community may reduce the chance of an infected person spreading the virus, there is no evidence they reduce the chance of being infected, and may even offer a false sense of security. It is understood the UK’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has similarly advised the government there is weak evidence face masks can reduce the spread of infection. However, some scientists have said the public should wear masks as a part of the ‘precautionary principle’, adding these can be homemade, noting surgical masks should only be used by health and social care workers. Sturgeon has recommended the public use something like a scarf or bandana. Doctors around the world are reporting a rare inflammatory condition in children In countries including the US, France, Spain and the UK, doctors are reporting cases of children with an unusual, but potentially deadly, inflammatory syndrome that has been linked to Covid-19. According to doctors in Europe, children of all ages appear to show symptoms including fever, digestive problems and vascular inflammation. Concerns were first raised in the UK after seeing a number of children admitted to intensive care with a combination of toxic shock and an inflammatory disorder known as Kawasaki disease. However, experts say the syndrome is rare. “Whilst this is an evolving situation, it is clear that these symptoms are reported in only handfuls of cases,” said Dr Nazima Pathan, a consultant in paediatric intensive care in Cambridge. “The important message is that if parents are worried about their children’s health, they should seek medical advice.” While progress is made with a coronavirus vaccine, doctors have raised concerns routine vaccinations are being missed Doctors say they have seen a drop in uptake of routine vaccinations as a result of the coronavirus lockdown, raising concerns that could lead to outbreaks of other diseases such as measles. In the US, MMR (mumps, measles and rubella) shots were down 50% in the week of 5 April, with diphtheria and whooping cough immunisations down 42%, while concerns have also been raised in the UK. Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners in the UK said: “Children can become very ill and die from the complications of common illnesses like measles that haven’t gone away. And immunisation is a fundamentally important part of preventing that from happening. We cannot allow delays in immunisations to go on for a long time, otherwise we really will see a crisis.”
204	A mosaic depicting Vladimir Putin and other top Russian officials will not be mounted in the Russian military’s new megachurch, a senior church official has said, after leaked photos of the artwork prompted public ridicule and received little Kremlin support. Photographs of the mosaic, leaked by the MBKh News website last week, showed Putin, his defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and other politicians and top brass in a crowd of people rallying in support of the 2014 annexation of Crimea. A missing panel, photographed separately, shows several women in front of a sign that reads “Crimea is ours”. The mammoth building, one of the world’s tallest Orthodox cathedrals, is situated in the military’s Patriot Park outside Moscow. One church commentator called it a “guilty plea to The Hague”. The Kremlin has distanced itself from the exhibit, with a spokesman saying: “Someday our thankful descendants will appreciate our merits, but it’s too early to do so now.’” On Friday, the senior priest of the Russian defence ministry’s new cathedral, the Resurrection of Christ, which will be one of the largest Orthodox churches in the world when opens, said its arts committee had decided against installing the artwork. “Consistent with the wish of the chief of state, the arts council decided against installing it,” Bishop Stefan, a church official, told the Interfax news service on Friday. He said the artwork had been photographed in a workshop and never been mounted in the church, which was due to open on 9 May, Victory Day, which this year marks the 75th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany. The opening has been delayed because of the coronavirus epidemic. Asked if the mosaic would be preserved, Bishop Stefan indicated it would be destroyed. “Why keep it if there is no use for it? You should ask mosaicists. They may install it somewhere if they need it,” he said. The cathedral is likely still to feature mosaics supporting the annexation of Crimea and depicting the image of Stalin on a banner at the 1945 victory parade It is a rare image of the Soviet leader on a state building in Russia since he was denounced by Nikita Khrushchev in 1956. Bishop Stefan and other church officials had defended the mosaic by saying that images of historical events, and of contemporary leaders, had featured in past artworks displayed in cathedrals.
205	Six weeks after first feeling unwell, Jenny* is still recovering from what she believes was Covid-19. On 17 March she, like many others, began preparing for an expected lockdown in the UK, stocking up on supermarket essentials. She was feeling a little flushed – something she put down to a reemergence of cold-like symptoms from a few weeks before. Then the other symptoms began, including a runny nose, sneezing and phlegm. “At that time, everybody was saying that runny noses and sneezing were not symptoms of coronavirus so I still didn’t think I had it,” the 33-year-old said. “Then I started coughing.” As the days marched on, other symptoms developed, including chest pains, shortness of breath and marks like dappled bruising on the feet – something Spanish doctors have suggested could be a sign of the disease. “It really was like one thing after another,” Jenny said, adding that on attempting to get back to work, typing in bed, she developed muscle pains in her wrists. Her flatmate also became ill – with symptoms including a fever and loss of taste and smell. Without testing, it is impossible to be sure, but it seemed highly probable that the cause of the illness in both flatmates was Covid-19. Jenny still feels exhausted, with days of feeling better followed by setbacks. “I still don’t feel better because a few days ago I started shivering, like I got a chill somehow,” she said. She is not alone: Fiona Lowenstein, a writer in the US, co-founded a group on the social media platform Slack for people who have experienced Covid-19 after it took her weeks to recover from being admitted to hospital with the disease. Many report waves of symptoms over a period of weeks – from heart palpitations to headaches, shortness of breath and fatigue. In a survey of group members, 89% of the 465 respondents said they had symptoms that fluctuated in intensity and frequency; 23% had tested positive for coronavirus, taking on average just over nine days to be tested from the onset to symptoms; 28% tested negative and were, on average, tested after about 15 days; and just 3.5% were admitted to hospital, although 38% visited an emergency department. With symptoms long-lasting, some members have concerns over whether they are still infectious. A report published in February by the World Health Organization, based on preliminary data, suggested in mild cases, the median recovery time from Covid-19 is about two weeks from the onset of symptoms, and about three to six weeks for severe or critical cases. But while severe Covid-19 may mean a long road to recovery, it seems even mild cases can, for some, involve many weeks of recuperation. Alice* is still experiencing symptoms more than 50 days after first becoming ill. Based in the UK, the 51-year-old said she joined the Slack group after reading an article by Lowenstein in the New York Times, and that finding the group was a “big relief”. From 11 March, Alice experienced consistent severe fatigue, chest pain and tightness, and a cough – but no fever. Other symptoms came and went in waves, including chills, insomnia and heart palpitations. “Day eight, nine, 10 was just really horrible, you are just concentrating on breathing and hanging in there,” she said. By week four she felt on the mend, and began some work and to exercise – but then relapsed. Eventually she went to A&amp;E. But despite being put in one of the hospital’s “coronavirus pods”, and having various investigations, she was not tested for the virus, she said. The symptoms continued to come and go, Alice said. “It is like a storm. One day you can have zero symptoms … then it will just go crazy and as quickly as it hits you it can go.” Lauren Nichols, 32, from Boston, Massachusetts, is another member of the Slack group. She has tested positive for Covid-19 twice and still has symptoms more than 50 days after first feeling unwell. She said the experience was a rollercoaster of symptoms and severities. “My biggest concern is that there is little visibility into the reality of what recovery truly looks like, as recovery from a medical perspective simply means that the patient ‘did not die’ and simply does not capture the lingering and painful symptoms that the Covid-19 recovery road truly entails for some or many,” Nichols said, adding that some of her most alarming symptoms occurred in her third and fifth weeks of being unwell. “I am concerned that employers and governments are rushing the recoveries of thousands who are still in pain and still symptomatic, without understanding that this causes both mental and physical complications for people already in a very vulnerable and unwell state of being,” she said, adding that she was also concerned about the lack of support for those recovering. • • • Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said it was perhaps not surprising that some people had long recoveries. “Many people often take weeks to completely recover from pneumonia,” he said. “In these cases, the viral illness has typically long since subsided and thus it is unlikely the patient will be infectious.” But it is unclear why some take longer than others to recover. “We know that recovery time after pneumonia is often influenced by the presence of co-morbidities and by age of the patient,” said Head. “Alongside that, many people will have undiagnosed co-morbidities, such as diabetes, also influencing how ill a patient becomes, and their recovery time.” The Slack group survey found two-thirds of respondents had a pre-existing medical condition, mainly seasonal allergies or asthma. Why there should be such variation in recovery time remains unknown, but a genetic element may play a part, said Dr James Gill, an honorary clinical lecturer at the University of Warwick and a locum GP. Preliminary work from King’s College London has suggested that genetic factors could account for about half of the variation in a number of key symptoms of Covid-19. Gill said he was only seeing about two to three patients a week with long-lasting symptoms, suggesting the experience is not common, although he noted that without community-level testing to know who had had the virus, it would remain unclear how common a recovery path was. But Gill said data from the Sars outbreak revealed that almost a third of those who had had that particular coronavirus still had a reduced tolerance to exercise many months later, despite having normal lung function. While Gill stressed that Covid-19 was a different disease, he said it could be that a similar proportion of about a fifth or a third of those with Covid-19 had lengthy recovery time . Although symptoms may linger, it is thought an individual is unlikely to be infectious once three days have passed with no raised temperature, but coughing should be treated with caution, Gill said. What recovery looks like is an evolving picture, he continued. “We are learning on a daily, weekly basis, things about how people are recovering from this, and we can’t know about the long-term impacts until we are in the long term.” Prof David Heymann, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, agreed with Gill. “Whenever a new virus that has come from the animal kingdom is identified in humans there is great concern about what is not known because humans do not have previous experience with this virus and the immune response it will cause,” Heymann said. “The only way to completely understand is by observation over the long term – and this includes recovery time from infection.” With suggestions that some cases of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) may arise after illnesses including viral infections, Gill said concern was starting to mount. “There are a lot of people wondering whether or not we are going to see an uptick in cases of chronic fatigue going forwards as a result [of Covid-19],” he said. “We don’t know that, but it is something that we are thinking may be possible.” Carmine Pariante, a professor of biological psychiatry at King’s College London, agreed there could be a rise in people experiencing a CFS-like syndrome. “We don’t know if this is going to happen with Covid-19 because we don’t have the follow-up data,” he said. “But the picture unfortunately, both in terms of the biochemical picture [of the immune response] and the acute fatigue, which is very prevalent, make us think it will be possible.” Gill said it was important that those who had had a coronavirus infection or suspected Covid-19, had access to physiotherapists and nutritional advice. Also helpful would be leaflets with advice on recovery, such as reminding patients to drink plenty of fluids and to do breathing exercises, said Gill, adding that some advice could be drawn from existing knowledge of other conditions. Ultimately, it is important to take time to recover, he said. “If you have had coronavirus and you have been flattened by it, you have no get-up-and-go, and you are fatigued. You need to rest, and you need to go back to work – or doing whatever you do – in a step-wise progression.” *Some names have been changed
206	The leader of one of the UK’s biggest teaching unions has told the government not to risk a “free-for-all” policy of allowing individual schools and academy trusts to decide when and how they will reopen. Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT, said he was concerned there had been discussions in government about giving schools and multi-academy trusts the flexibility and freedom to decide for themselves about reopening. In an interview with the Guardian, Roach said: “What should not happen is that the government just simply sets a date for schools to be reopened, and then says to schools, to local authorities and multi-academy trusts, it’s over to you now to work out how we are going to deliver that. “The government has a responsibility to have a clear and coherent plan around the reopening of schools which is led by the scientific evidence which does not result in a free-for-all, where individual schools make their own decisions which could compromise public health and the welfare of those working in schools.” Schools have been closed to all children, except those of key workers and those classified as vulnerable, since 20 March as part of national efforts to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Roach and other union and school leaders have since been holding regular talks with the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, and department officials about how schools should respond to the pandemic. Roach, who took over as general secretary of the NASUWT in April, said: “There have been discussions about leaving it up to schools to decide, in keeping with government policy over the last 10 years to increase freedoms and flexibility in the system. “We’ve been very clear it’s vitally important that the government take charge of the situation and they give schools clarity, certainly of what the national expectations are in relation to schools reopening and how schools should go about doing that.” Conservative education policy has focussed in recent years on allowing greater flexibility and increasing school autonomy through its academies programme, which moves schools out of local authority control and into multi-academy trusts. Williamson told MPs on the education select committee on Wednesday that schools would reopen in phases and Boris Johnson has promised to set out further plans next week about how to ease lockdown restrictions. The government has said schools will reopen only when it is safe to do so. Roach said he was concerned, however, that ministers were coming under pressure from Conservative backbenchers and others to speed up the reopening of schools, which would allow parents back to work to help kickstart the economy. “We are asking ministers to resist that pressure and focus on the public health issues,” said Roach. “But that pressure may prove to be irresistible and ministers might move sooner rather than later to reopen schools in some form. “I’m sure there’s a desire to see schools open this side of the summer break. From my point of view, what’s critically important is that such decisions are taken on the basis of public health concerns, ensuring the health and safety of our members and pupils.” Roach said it was still unclear how social distancing might work in schools, or whether personal protective equipment (PPE) would be available for staff who need it.
207	US fossil fuel companies have taken at least $50m in taxpayer money they probably won’t have to pay back, according to a review of coronavirus aid meant for struggling small businesses by the investigative research group Documented and the Guardian. A total of $28m is going to three coal mining companies, all with ties to Trump officials, bolstering a dying American industry and a fuel that scientists insist world leaders must shift away from to avoid the worst of the climate crisis. The other $22m is being paid out to oil and gas services and equipment providers and other firms that work with drillers and coal miners. Melinda Pierce, the legislative director for the Sierra Club, said: “The federal money Congress appropriated should be going to help small businesses and frontline workers struggling as a result of the pandemic, not the corporate polluters whose struggles are a result of failing business practices and existed long before Covid-19 entered the public lexicon.” More than 40 Democratic lawmakers have argued that fossil fuel companies should not get any assistance under the coronavirus aid package. Some Democrats have also warned the forgivable loans being made under Congress’ Paycheck Protection Program could be a transparency disaster. Banks and lending institutions are distributing the money, so the government says it cannot track recipients in real time. The loans revealed have been made public only through news reports and securities filings by publicly-traded companies, although the Federal Reserve has committed to issuing monthly reports. So far, it’s clear the program is not working as intended. The funds are aimed at helping small businesses to keep paying their employees and covering other recurring expenses during the economic downturn. But they have been exploited by large companies forced to return the money amid a public outcry, including the Los Angeles Lakers, Shake Shack and Ruth’s Chris Steak House. The industry aid comes as the Trump administration is reportedly considering a broader bailout for oil and gas corporations, which were already under pressure before the coronavirus and have watched oil prices nosedive because of a global price war and low demand for gasoline. The US government could make loans to oil and gas companies, essentially making taxpayers investors in the industry. The Federal Reserve on Thursday also announced changes to its lending rules that could help indebted petroleum firms. “The idea that oil workers are getting a paycheck is great,” said Jamie Henn, a spokesman for the Stop the Money Pipeline campaign who co-founded the environment group 350.org. “The worry is that the money’s going to the top and not going to filter down.” The $50m already paid to fossil fuel companies is a small fraction of the the $2.1tn Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, known as the Cares Act. But the total assistance to the industry is likely much larger than can currently be tallied and will continue to grow. Environmental advocates and oversight experts tracking the funds say it’s impossible to count how much of the money will assist fossil fuels, including because some firms provide services across multiple industries. “All of this is voluntary disclosures by the companies,” said Jesse Coleman, a senior researcher with Documented. “No matter what, it’s going to be an incomplete picture of what’s going on.” Coleman said in many cases the fossil fuel companies getting aid have made bad investments and “now they’re going to come crawling hat in hand and say: look at what the coronavirus did to us”. Among the coronavirus aid recipients is Hallador Coal, an Indiana-based coal mining company that hired Donald Trump’s former environment chief Scott Pruitt as a lobbyist. The company’s former government relations director now works at the energy department. Hallador is taking $10m to fund two months of payroll and other expenses. Coal mining company Rhino Resources, which was formerly run by Trump’s Mine Safety and Health Administration head, David Zatezalo, is receiving $10m. Coal firm Ramaco Resources, whose CEO, Randy Atkins, is on the energy department’s National Coal Council, is getting $8.4m. The US coal industry has been in steep decline, driven out of the market by cheap natural gas and environmental concerns. Trump campaigned on putting coal miners back to work, and his agencies have unsuccessfully explored ways to bail out coal companies, which are seeing their lowest employment levels in modern history. The Trump administration has also rescinded nearly all of the environment and climate protections the fossil fuel industry has opposed. Fossil fuel companies can also take advantage of tax benefits under the coronavirus legislation, including deferring payment of social security and medicare taxes. The Missouri-based Peabody Energy coal company has said it will speed up collecting an alternative minimum tax refund of $24m to 2020 and defer $18m of owed taxes. US taxpayers already subsidize the fossil fuel industry at roughly $20bn a year, according to conservative estimates. The Center for International Environmental Law has accused the oil, gas and plastics industries of “exploiting the crisis by aggressively lobbying for massive bailouts and special privileges in a desperate attempt to revive an oil and gas industry already in decline”. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis argues that federal lending to the oil and gas sector would be “a complete waste of money”, because it wouldn’t fix the industry’s underlying financial problems. Oil industry lobbyists have pushed for changes at the Federal Reserve to let companies with large amounts of debt use its Main Street Lending Program and borrow to pay off existing loans. In an 15 April letter to the Federal Reserve, the oil trade group the Independent Petroleum Association of America asked for the new provisions, saying “oil and natural gas producers are not looking for a government handout; they are seeking a bridge to help survive this economic disruption.” Environmental advocates say the move would disproportionately benefit small and mid-sized oil and gas companies, such as Occidental Petroleum, which has nearly $80bn in liabilities on its balance sheet. Graham Steele, who directs the corporations and society initiative at Stanford Graduate School of Business, called the situation the “classic disaster scenario where an opportunistic administration and industry is taking advantage of a crisis”. “And by the way, these are industries driving climate change. It’s both a bad financial proposition of the Fed and for taxpayers and a bad situation for the planet.”
208	Lawyers for the Duchess of Sussex have insisted her privacy claim against the publishers of the Mail on Sunday (MoS) will continue after she was dealt an initial blow when a judge ruled that part of her case should be struck out. Lawyers for Associated Newspapers had argued last month against elements including that some words and sentences from a letter by Meghan to her estranged father, Thomas Markle, had been “dishonestly” cut out before publication in order to paint a misleading picture of the relationship between the two. She is suing the newspaper group for misuse of private information, breach of data protection and copyright infringement after the Mail on Sunday and Mail Online, which it owns, published contents of the handwritten letter sent to Markle, 75, in August 2018. Associated Newspapers denies the claims. Delivering his ruling on Friday, Mr Justice Warby struck out allegations that the publisher had acted “dishonestly” by leaving out certain passages of the letter. He also struck out allegations that the publisher deliberately “stirred up” issues between Meghan and her father, and that it had an “agenda” of publishing intrusive or offensive stories about her. Those allegations should not form part of the duchess’s case at this stage, he said, because they were “irrelevant” to her claim for misuse of private information, copyright infringement and breach of the Data Protection Act. But he said those parts of her case may be revived at a later stage, if they are put on a proper legal basis. “Some of the allegations are struck out as irrelevant to the purpose for which they are pleaded,” said the judge in a written ruling. “Some are struck out on the further or alternative ground that they are inadequately detailed. I have also acted so as to confine the case to what is reasonably necessary and proportionate for the purpose of doing justice between these parties. “I do not consider that the allegations struck out on that basis go to the ‘heart’ of the case, which at its core concerns the publication of five articles disclosing the words of, and information drawn from, the letter written by the claimant to her father in August 2018.” Schillings, the law firm representing the duchess said the ruling made it very clear that the core elements of the case do not change, saying: “The duchess’s rights were violated; the legal boundaries around privacy were crossed.” A spokesperson added: “Whilst the judge recognises that there is a claim for breach of privacy and copyright, we are surprised to see that his ruling suggests that dishonest behaviour is not relevant.” The action by the duchess focuses on five articles – two in the Mail on Sunday, and three on Mail Online – reproducing parts of the letters, with the headline on one reading: “Revealed: The letter showing the true tragedy of Meghan’s rift with a father she says has ‘broken her heart into a million pieces’.” During a hearing last month, which was heard remotely before a virtual court hearing in London, lawyers for Meghan accused the Mail of “stirring up” issues between the duchess and Markle, then using it to justify publishing a “private and confidential” letter. She was said to have been distressed at the realisation that Associated Newspapers had an agenda of “intrusive and offensive” stories about her. But counsel for the publisher argued that allegations of “dishonesty and malicious intent” were not relevant in a misuse of private information case. Claims that the newspaper had “harassed, humiliated, manipulated and exploited” her were “remarkable” given that she had not contacted her father to ask if he agreed, he added. The ruling was a “total loss” for Meghan, according to Mark Stephens, a libel and privacy expert at the law firm Howard Kennedy, who said that the judge had struck out a “significant but ill-informed” part of her claim. She now faced paying between £200,000 to £250,000 in costs for pursuing what he described as “a wide-ranging attack on the media,” and the prospect of being cross-examined during the case about the way she and friends “curated” her reputation. “She had a very simple and quite strong – on the face of it – case of privacy, because it was a confidential letter written from an estranged daughter to an estranged father. It has now pared back to a privacy and copyright claim,” Stephens added. Another lawyer, Jonathan Coad of Coad Law, said the newspaper had scored a tactical victory by paring down the claim, which he said had been “over-egged” in a way that had not stood up to the forensic scrutiny of the court. “This will all contribute to the exertion of pressure by the MoS on Ms Markle to abandon her claim,” he added. But the campaign group Hacked Off said that the judgment would make no difference to the substantial claim for misuse of private information. Nathan Sparkes, the policy director at Hacked Off, said: “Harry and Meghan have been dragged through the mud by the Mail, which has waged a campaign of intrusion and abuse against Ms Markle in particular.”
209	You cannot accuse Car Seat Headrest, AKA Will Toledo, of taking the easy route. Four years on from the release of breakthrough record Teens of Denial, Toledo is back with new album Making a Door Less Open, only now he is going under the name Trait and is wearing a gas mask in photos. Toledo’s restless and impassioned indie rock is looking a little different, too. The new album blends his classic songwriting chops with a bold exploration of electronic textures. This is the result of essentially making the album twice: once as Car Seat Headrest, and again alongside producer Andrew Katz as their jokey EDM side project 1 Trait Danger, before landing on a middle ground. “My process is always reactive [when making a new record],” Toledo says over the phone from his home in Seattle. “I didn’t have any concrete ideas beyond something that did not sound like Teens of Denial.” Repeating the formula that made Car Seat Headrest one of the most critically acclaimed new acts in recent years “wasn’t even a possibility”. If anything, his success thus far was more reason to embark on a musical pivot. “I’m driving the car and I know where I want to go,” he says. “Now people can really see what I’m capable of.” In reality, Making a Door Less Open is not the huge leap in sound that it may first appear – guitars bristle and explode throughout the scabrous Hollywood, while Toledo’s love of Radiohead’s Kid A shows itself in the glitchy pulses of Martin and Can’t Cool Me Down. The prolific artist – this is somehow the 27-year-old Toledo’s 13th album – admits that he is “too much of a shut-in’’ to embrace club culture and argues “good party music is songs you can listen to on your own or in a group setting. The goal was to make music that could flip-flop like that.” Escaping his introverted tendencies is also at the heart of Toledo’s Trait character. It doesn’t take a psychoanalyst to deduce that wearing a mask is one way to escape; Toledo is quick to cop to this. “Trait is a creature filled with exuberant energy. The character is a way to be an embodiment of that energy rather than some schmuck with a microphone.” He needn’t be so bashful. By effectively collaborating with himself, Toledo has avoided the pitfalls of repetition and complacency; a trap that he recognises makes some bands sound “conservative”, amid a lack of “tension” between old friends who have become overly comfortable. Making a Door Less Open has also shown a new path for artists, who can now collaborate with their own alter ego. In a period when getting into the studio with someone else isn’t possible, it might just be an unlikely way forward.
210	Physically, I’m about as robust as Stick Man. I’m weak enough to have seriously considered that my five-year-old is now physically stronger than me. When I hear “core”, all I think of is Andrea and her Irish singing siblings. So the idea of wearing a very heavy jacket like this sturdy biker one, gives me pause for thought. It will, I realise, force a rethink of how I move, and how I walk. But I’m being open-minded about the style, because the biker jacket has come a long way. It was created by Irving Schott in 1928, in conjunction with Harley-Davidson, with a specific function in mind (belt buckles placed in certain places to protect you from the wind while riding; zippers for easy access). Marlon Brando’s jacket in The Wild One was from this range. Brando helped move it to the mainstream, and since then it’s been loved by wrong ’uns, rebels, greasers and Ramones. About seven years ago, it became a womenswear staple, paired with a delicate dress. And then it went mass market: H&amp;M, All Saints and Gap all produced their own versions, which varied widely in dimensions and style (quilted, studded, weird zip placement). The biker jacket has been back this season thanks to Givenchy, Saint Laurent and Burberry, and looked convincing on the catwalk. But when I put it on, it feels strange. I’m unsure if I’m wearing it, or it’s wearing me. The zips confuse me, too: what can I put in all these extremely skinny pockets? A couple of tissues? A stick of gum? A single Kraft cheese slice and two playing cards? I don’t see myself trading in my bomber or trench any time soon. But if you’re looking for something that will anchor you against the strongest spring breeze (and a lifelong investment) this one’s for you.
211	Many of us, while nipping to the shop or on our daily walk, will find ourselves gazing into the dark, empty windows of pubs and restaurants, looking forward to the day when things go back to “normal”. But it’s becoming increasingly clear that the high street of six weeks ago is gone, as businesses struggle to pay rents with no income. Even successful pubs and restaurants are already being listed for sale. We’re now starting to get the first tentative bits of economic analysis into where all the pieces may lie when things finally start picking up. And it’s very apparent that the north of England is about to hit serious economic trouble. Of the 20 places in Britain with the highest proportion of employees working in restaurants and pubs, 10 are in the north, and just five in the south. Indeed, research from the Royal Society of Arts this week found that chancellor Rishi Sunak’s constituency of Richmond in North Yorkshire could lose the most jobs, as 35% of his constituents work in hospitality. Naturally, very few parts of the UK will be spared serious damage. Yet, while the wealthier regions of London and much of the south could absorb the impact of another recession, there are a lot of indications that the north simply cannot go through that again. Figures show the south-west is taking enormous hits in this crisis too. But the south hasn’t had quite the same economic battering over the past decade – between 2009-10 and 2017-18 public spending in the north dropped by £3.6bn, while rising £5.1bn in the south. The reality is that whole swathes of the north have still not fully recovered from the last financial crash. When the IPPR thinktank looked into the five-year progress of the Northern Powerhouse project last year, it found the number of children in poverty in the north had increased by 200,000 to 800,000, the jobs paid less than the living wage rose by 11%, and real-terms weekly pay increased by only £12 in the north compared with an average national rise of £19. So not only is the north-south productivity gap at Victorian levels thanks to decades of underinvestment and a brutal 10 years of austerity – it is actually getting worse. Northern councils are now warning of “alarm bells” over huge gaps in funding, as some are struggling to provide basic services. Most councils in Britain have already been stripped to the bone and, with no cushion, some are now considering bankruptcy. Put simply, there’s nothing left to cut in the north. Another round of austerity would simply collapse many towns and cities that were already just scraping through. We have the developed world’s biggest regional economic divide, across virtually every measure. For our London-dominated politics it’s a simple case of “out of sight, out of mind”. Governments have a history of protecting the financial centre of London and the south-east. Despite the chancellor’s own constituency being hit badly, there’s little indication that this time will be any different – which would be such a wasted opportunity. There are endless ways of investing in Britain that would support the whole of the UK and reduce the north’s drag on the economy. The government could temporarily suspend the 20% VAT on food served in pubs and restaurants for the year after lockdown finishes, or remove tax on beer and wine. Just like Gordon Brown’s car scrappage scheme, these measures would cost the exchequer in the short term but could keep local economies afloat, saving more in the long term. Or something even more substantial – a holiday voucher scheme where the government pays, say, 30% per cent, towards the cost of a trip in the UK, whether that’s a weekend in a caravan in Blackpool or 10 days in a luxury eco-home in the Cotswolds. It’s likely this government will fall back on the same regressive measures that Conservatives have traditionally used . But it’s now clear that, without careful handling, the looming economic collapse in parts of the north will totally overshadow the 2008 crash and its aftermath. • Robyn Vinter is a journalist and editor based in Leeds, UK.

212	It was a low-key comeback. After a week in hospital, and two more spent recuperating at Chequers, the prime minister’s official country residence, Boris Johnson arrived at Downing Street last weekend in an inconspicuous Volkswagen mini-van. He slipped inside. There was no victory sign or cheerful wave. For an unprecedented period, the prime minister had been missing. He was either laid low from his coronavirus symptoms, in intensive care in St Thomas’ hospital in Westminster, or recovering from what the tabloids called his “brush with death”. It was clear that few major government decisions had been made in Johnson’s long absence. Now, according to aides, he was “raring to go”; he was ready to “take control” of government affairs and to “bounce back”. The country, not to mention deferential cabinet colleagues, were waiting for some answers. Was Johnson in favour of easing lockdown? When and how might this happen? And were his laissez-faire instincts a thing of the past? There were personal questions, too. Namely, whether Johnson’s experience of grave illness had recast his personality for the better. In the pre-virus days, the serious politician played second fiddle to the crowd-pleasing comedian and columnist. Now, some saw Johnson taking on a new persona befitting our pandemic-shaped age: that of a statesman. On Monday, for instance, the Times reported an unnamed cabinet minister saying his illness “has changed him … He now has an emotional connection to the NHS that you don’t get from anything except a near-death experience.” The early signals, though, were mixed. At 9am on Monday morning Johnson appeared in front of Downing Street. His five-minute speech showed a man labouring to breathe as he spoke. His clothes seemed to hang off him – his appearance and demeanour a physical embodiment of the effects of the infection. He gave no hint as to when schools and non-essential shops might reopen and some measure of normal life resume. Nor was there acknowledgement – tacit or otherwise – that his time away had clarified his thinking, or made him inclined to choose this moment to “level with the country”, as he has previously promised to do, about the decisions that have been taken, the potential mistakes that have been made over the timing of the lockdown. He swerved around the questions about the lockdown, the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the chaos over testing. Instead, Johnson asked the nation for patience. “I believe we are coming now to the end of the first phase of the conflict”, he said. There seemed to be deliberate echoes here of Churchill’s famous second world war speech about the “end of the beginning”. Johnson offered further flourishes. The disease – as he himself knew – was “an invisible mugger”. Thanks to our collective efforts, Britain had “wrestled it to the ground”. The phrase didn’t really capture the grim and multitudinous truth. By Monday more than 20,000 people had officially died of the virus – in hospitals, care centres, or in quiet agony at home, surrounded by loved ones. They were not so much mugged as extinguished before their time. By the end of the week the official tally was 27,000-plus, and probably much higher. To his critics, who have included normally loyal supporters in the rightwing media, there are still searching questions about the prime minister’s decisions in late February and March – or lack of them. By some analyses, the UK is on track to have the highest death rate in Europe. Other countries, led by Germany and Denmark, have done much better. Were they less complacent and more organised? Either way, they are now emerging from lockdown. Another moment for Johnson to address these issues might have been prime minister’s questions on Wednesday. He was due for the first time to face up to Sir Keir Starmer, the new Labour leader. But the evening before, Downing Street wouldn’t say whether Johnson planned to turn up, which was odd.There was speculation Johnson might still be somewhat unwell. In fact, something else was going on. On Wednesday morning, Johnson was at his partner Carrie Symonds’ side as she gave birth to a baby boy at an NHS hospital. It was the latest dramatic event in what had been an extraordinary period for Johnson, several lives squashed into one almost: Brexit, Covid-19, and the unparalleled shut-down of national life. A photo taken on the stairs of Downing Street showed a grinning Johnson, back from his fiancee’s bedside. He looks elated and nobody could begrudge the couple their happiness. Well-wishers noted babies change people for the better; cynics pointed out that Johnson has been a father five – or more – times before, and that this arrival might prove a distraction from the tasks ahead. In the nine months since he became PM, Johnson has frequently seemed semi-engaged. Over New Year he had a holiday in the Caribbean. In February he spent 12 days at Chevening, the government’s estate in Kent, missing five Cobra meetings as Covid-19 spread from China. Reportedly he took weekends off. Former colleagues have joked Johnson prefers to do many things badly, rather than one thing well – more of a chairman than a CEO. Downing Street aides say this is wrong. They insist Johnson is devoting his full attention to the coronavirus crisis. One ministerial adviser said he was busier at the end of his time off than was admitted. He asked for submissions on a whole range of issues, not just Covid-19. His time in hospital reignited his desire to take care of the NHS, and to get back to work, the adviser said. Johnson is now determined to “turn the tide” on the virus by mid-June, officials suggest. In his absence ministers have argued about the right way forward. Johnson is keen to take back control of the political situation, officials stress, and is reportedly annoyed at leaks suggesting the cabinet is split between pro-economy hawks and cautious lockdown doves. So what next? Before falling sick, Johnson could be counted among those who were bullish about the prospect of easing restrictions and returning to business as usual relatively quickly. Multiple sources with knowledge of his thinking say some of that optimism has faded. They says this partly reflects his own experiences in intensive care – but also the changing scientific picture presented to him. “There has been briefing from some close to No 10 against Matt [Hancock]. But the truth is the PM’s position is much closer to Matt’s than those pushing for measures to be lifted. Dom [Raab] has come round to that view as well,” one cabinet source said. It was Johnson, apparently, who approved the decision to add care home figures to the daily death tally – a risky move towards transparency, given the horrifying numbers involved. And then on Thursday the prime minister appeared for the first time in well over a month at the government’s 5pm press conference. Again, he was breathless. And more hesitant than usual, misreading the figure for deaths. And again, he chose not to address the questions that have been asked of him personally, or his government. So far, neither he, nor anybody in his top team, has wanted to meet the challenge set them by Intisar Chowdhury, the 18-year-old son of an NHS doctor who died with coronavirus. The teenager has asked for an apology, for ministers to “openly acknowledge there have been mistakes in handling this virus.” At the daily briefing, Johnson stressed the allegedly good news. The UK had passed the peak of the disease. It was was on a downward slope. He promised details next week of how lockdown might end. There would be a “roadmap” and a “menu of options”. There was a warning, too. Johnson likened the pandemic to a pleasant European motoring holiday that had got into unexpected difficulty. Britain was driving through a “huge Alpine tunnel”. Ahead were “sunlight and pasture”. It needed to keep control, lest it run into a “second and bigger mountain”. He claimed the UK had avoided the tragedy that had engulfed other places. Asked if his time in hospital had altered him, he said he was “very, very lucky” and paid tribute to the “thousands of people” who had been less fortunate. For the moment, Johnson’s political opponents recognise he is unassailable. His popularity ratings are high. The country, polls suggest, is inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt, at least for now, while the virus is still a threat and the NHS is under great strain. The new baby will generate further goodwill. There have been gushing headlines from the pro-Boris ringwing media, with more to come when the boy is named, and the first pictures emerge. It is the perfect plotline in a time of gloom. But Johnson will not be able to put off a reckoning forever. The government’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said as much on Thursday when he suggested the country needed to focus on the crisis in hand, and not dwell – for now – on how we got here. Other leaders have emerged from the crisis with their reputations enhanced – Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand, Angela Merkel in Germany, Andrew Cuomo in New York. But they followed a different template: level with the public, admit mistakes, explain the facts. Will Johnson do likewise? There were few indications last week that Johnson is inclined to do so. So far, at least, the new Boris looks remarkably like the old one.
213	Magnus Carlsen has qualified for this weekend’s semi-finals in his $250,000 online elite invitational, but Norway’s world champion, 29, now faces strong and ambitious rivals in the context of his own erratic form. Carlsen won several games in fine style in the all-play-all preliminaries, but also suffered eight defeats, three of them to China’s world No 3, Ding Liren, who he meets again in Saturday’s semi-final. The match starts at 3pm, and can be viewed free and live online at chess24.com with move by move grandmaster and computer commentaries. The reigning US champion, Hikaru Nakamura, defeated the world No 2, Fabiano Caruana, 4-2 in the all-American first semi-final on Friday. The pair finished 2-2 in 15-minute rapid but Nakamura won 2-0 in five-minute blitz. Scores in the group phase were Nakamura (US) and Ding (China) 15 match points, Carlsen (Norway) and Caruana (US) 13, Ian Nepomniachtchi (Russia) 8, Alireza Firouzja (ex-Iran) and Anish Giri (Netherlands) 7, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (France) 6 (13.5). Carlsen won his first four matches impressively, but then, with his semi-final qualification almost assured, he became too careless, relaxed or erratic and suffered reverses using offbeat openings. His first black game against Ding began with a dubious Scandinavian Defence 1 e4 Nc6 2 Nf3 d5 3 exd5 Qxd5, and his second with the outlandish 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5 h5?! Playing White, Carlsen lost with the King’s Gambit 1 e4 e5 2 f4. His worst opening disaster came against Nepomniachtchi, Russia’s world No 4, which began 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Nxd4 Nf6 5 Bc4?! Nxe4 6 Qh5 e6. Here White should play 7 Bb5+, but after several minutes thought Carlsen chose 7 Nxe6?? Bxe6 8 Bxe6 Qe7! when Black wins a piece and the game, although White continued for another 20 moves before resigning. “I just completely blanked and couldn’t remember what to do,” said Carlsen. The same unsound sacrifice at e6 occurred 56 years ago during Bobby Fischer’s 1964 US simultaneous tour. Fischer was Black and instantly found the refutation. Ding’s performance was sharp, confident, and completely recovered from his disastrous over-the-board Candidates where his play suffered from enforced quarantines at home and in Russia. He won in 16 moves against the Frenchman who led the Candidates when it was abandoned. Ding could be the favourite Saturday, but Carlsen said: “Now it’s dead serious. From now on you will see me from a completely different side.” Just two days after the Carlsen Invitational ends, the global chess body, Fide, launches the Nations Cup with teams from China, United States, Europe, Russia, India and the Rest of the World. China are the favourites, fielding their top four men plus Hou Yifan and Ju Wenjun for the women’s board. While Carlsen’s tournament has been played on chess24, which he partly owns, the Nations Cup will be on chess.com, which was already a partner in the 2019 Isle of Man world championship qualifier. Their website rivalry is set to intensify, as neither publicises the other’s tournaments. A third major site, lichess.org, which is user-friendly and the best for newcomers to internet chess, hosted Carlsen’s marathon bullet match against Firouzja and is the venue for Britain’s online 4NCL league, now in its fourth week and where matches can be viewed every Tuesday evening. Carlsen’s absence from the Nations Cup could mark the beginning of a fundamental split. A few years ago he stated that the world championship needed a new format, much like what has been on show on chess24 this week, and he has also conspicuously failed to confirm that he will defend his global crown in Dubai in December 2021, which is Fide’s current plan. For its first 60 years the world champion decided his own challenger, and some worthy candidates were rejected because they could not raise funds while lesser lights were sometimes accepted because they had backers. There was another hiatus from 1993 to 2005 when Garry Kasparov broke with Fide and there were two rival claimants. It could have happened in 1975, too, if the Bobby Fischer-Anatoly Karpov negotiations had been successful. Now, as in the era of Emanuel Lasker, José Capablanca, and Kasparov, there is a dominant champion, while due to Covid-19 the official world body has been forced to substantially curtail its programme. In particular the Candidates tournament to decide Carlsen’s challenger was stopped at halfway and remains in limbo with resumption unlikely before 2021. Could Carlsen try to fill this vacuum with his own online world championship series? 3669: 1...Bxe4 2 Qxe4 Qxe4 3 Rxe4 Rxh4! when if 4 Rxh4 Bxf2+ with Bxh4 and the extra bishop wins.
214	Brexit could put at risk the contact tracing of coronavirus patients on the island of Ireland if the UK crashes out of the EU without a trade deal at the end of the year, the health minister in the Northern Ireland assembly has conceded. Contact tracing in the region is expected to resume next week but may face challenges if the virus, as is probable, continues to threaten communities beyond the 31 December deadline for a Brexit trade deal, local politicians have said. The tracing of number plates, flight passenger lists and coronavirus test results could become impossible unless the UK agrees a deal on its future relationship with the EU that includes security and data-sharing arrangements. “What detail, what level of information we share [in 2021] has still to be worked out,” said Robin Swann, Stormont’s health minister. Data shared between authorities in Belfast and Dublin helped in February to trace passengers on a plane that landed in Dublin airport who may have had contact with a resident who went on to Northern Ireland and later tested positive for coronavirus. The Social Democrat and Labour party assembly member Matthew O’Tooleasked Swann if this would continue beyond December in the absence of a trade deal or extension to the transition period. “We will probably still be contact tracing people, we will still be moving from Dundalk to Newry and Buncrana to Derry,” said O’Toole in reference to border towns. “Is there a risk that if we leave the transition period without a deal and there is legal uncertainty around our information governance framework that would put contact tracing particularly in border areas into risk?” Swann replied that it had been flagged as an issue under Brexit’s Operation Yellowhammer contingency planning but that no action could be taken until they knew what shape Brexit would take. “This is new to this island, this is new to the UK, this is new to Europe and we look at how we actually start to do this level of contact tracing so when it comes to legalities, who holds the information? Is it held on your phone, is it held in a central database? That all has to be [worked out] at this point of time,” he told the Stormont assembly. “Let’s get it up and running and we will work round the rest of it when we get to the end of the year and we see where we are in regards to Brexit.” Swann’s comments come as the European commission told the UK that time was short to implement the Northern Ireland protocol that Boris Johnson included in the withdrawal agreement in January. A technical note issued by Brussels put flesh on the bones of the protocol and served as a reminder of the scale of the challenge facing businesses and now health authorities in the face of a national health emergency. After the first meeting of the specialised committee of EU and UK officials tasked with implementing the Northern Ireland rules, the commission said the exchanges “now urgently need to be followed up by tangible measures”. Andrew McCormick, a senior official from the Northern Ireland civil service, was present at the meeting.
215	Thousands of workers stream in single file, at dawn and mid-afternoon, to suit up in masks and chain gloves and put their lives on the line so you can put cheap sausage on your biscuit. They are accustomed to living in fear – of starvation from drought in Guatemala, or death squads in El Salvador or drug cartels in Mexico. Of being hunted and caged, whether documented or not. And now, of meeting their fate over a pork chop. “It’s genocide against the working class. It’s hard to visualize it and articulate it for what it is,” Jesse Case, the leader of Teamsters Local 238, the largest private-sector union in Iowa, told me. Donald Trump, invoking the Defense Production Act, has ordered meatpacking plants to stay open no matter the cost. Plants won’t even close for a deep cleaning when a deadly pathogen is found. The president said he is protecting companies from liability – you know, in case somebody keels over because of someone else’s negligence. Across America, packing plants for beef, pork, chicken and turkey have been closing as workers fall ill with Covid-19 or die. The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) has said that at least 72 of its members have died from coronavirus, and thousands more may be infected; because of the lack of tests, no one knows the true number. Despite repeated warnings in the presidential briefing books months ago, nobody instructed industry to gear up or how. In Storm Lake, Iowa, center of the densest livestock-producing region in America, none of the roughly 2,500 pork and turkey processing workers at Tyson Foods plants have been tested for the coronavirus. Hence, Buena Vista county reports only four cases so far, while nearby red meat hub Sioux City is the hottest spot in the USA. Workers’ temperatures are checked. If they feel sick they are advised to stay home. They are told to space out and not crowd into the locker rooms. Plastic hangs between workers on the line. Tyson says it is doing all it can by staggering breaks and spacing workers. Iowa’s governor, Kim Reynolds, a Republican, directed testing resources to Tyson’s Waterloo plant. There, workers are represented by the UFCW. The local sheriff said he wanted a boot slammed down on the slaughterhouse. But in Storm Lake, testing is limited to healthcare and nursing home workers and patients. None for the packinghouse crowd, who are overwhelmingly Latino and non-union. Before the order they did their duty and clocked in. Nobody had to threaten them. They need the check. If you report sick with the virus, you might imagine finding yourself on the next bus to Juárez whether you have papers or not. They want to work – safely. Tyson says that its workers are documented. But Trump and the likes of the Iowa congressman Steve King, the race-baiting Republican, have Latino workers shaking in their boots. The governor warns that if a plant reopens and you don’t show up, unemployment benefits cease. And then the president orders that the plants shall reopen come hell or a virus. The leaders of the big meatpackers are warning of spot meat shortages – plant capacity has dropped 40% in recent weeks from worker shortages. You just can’t let this Storm Lake plant shut down. But what happens if it explodes? The anxiety cuts to our quick. Remember, too, that Smithfield Foods is owned by a Chinese conglomerate. Prestage Farms, in Eagle Grove, Iowa, has taken to sending whole hog carcasses to China for lack of further processing help amid our cornfields. This is not really an American food shortage. The supply chain is so tight that when two plants go down – Smithfield in Sioux Falls and Tyson in Waterloo – fully 10% of national pork production is knocked out. Everyone has to eat, and they have not yet developed a taste for algae or even tofu. The world eats meat. Shoppers can clear out a grocery display in minutes, and a meat supply in a week. Somebody has to process the hogs and birds that keep coming no matter a virus. Mike Pence called our neighbors heroes. The secretary of agriculture, Sonny Perdue, called them patriots. Trump stopped legal residency permitting for immigrants. Nobody is talking about amnesty or even hearing the refugees. In fact, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa told Bloomberg Law nobody is talking about providing undocumented workers healthcare. The state and federal governments did not order slower line speeds or provide protective gear for the packinghouse. Tyson asked for imposed guidance and resources, and got a promise of liability protection from worker claims. But there is this sticky thing called the 10th amendment that does not allow the president to waive corporate liabilities in state courts or workers’ compensation processes, says Storm Lake attorney Willis Hamilton, who has been advocating for food processing employees for nearly 50 years. The order was about instilling fear, Hamilton said. He says his clients are afraid of sick leave and afraid of filing for workers’ comp or unemployment. “They have to threaten people. These ‘don’t even think about it’ orders fit into a system that marches workers to their deaths,” Case said. “Fear is turning to anger, and that’s when people organize.” Or just pray. Art Cullen is editor of the Storm Lake Times in north-west Iowa, where he won the Pulitzer prize for editorial writing. He is a Guardian US columnist and author of the book Storm Lake: Change, Resilience, and Hope in America’s Heartland (Penguin)
216	Thousands of Indian students unable to leave the UK because of the coronavirus lockdown are relying on food donations from charities because they can no longer afford to eat. Student groups representing the students, from across the UK, have been coordinating emergency food drops with local community groups and charities. Many of the young people have lost their part-time jobs and can no longer afford even basic living costs. The Indian National Students’ Association, one of the largest student groups, says so far it has helped to distribute food to more than 3,000 struggling students across the country. A second UK-wide students’ group, the National Indian Students and Alumni Union, says it has also had calls from hundreds of students who cannot afford food. Charan Sekhon, chair of an Anglo-Indian charity based in Bedford called the Seva Trust, which has delivered food parcels to more than 60 Indian students in its local area, says: “We have had lots of examples where students are actually starving. They haven’t got anything at all to eat.” Virendra Sharma, Labour MP for Ealing Southall, wrote to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, on Wednesday calling for universities to ringfence money from hardship funds, which are often discretionary, for international students. He also called for minimum service standards for universities to ensure they are offering students enough advice and support. He wrote: “I have heard stories of international students contemplating suicide because they do not know what to do and cannot afford to eat.” India banned all international flights from 22 March, giving students only two days to arrange to get home. Flights that typically cost around £300 were selling for £2,000, and thousands of students found themselves stranded in Britain. India is the fastest growing market for British universities, with nearly 27,000 Indian students coming to the UK in 2018-19. International students can pay up to £38,000 a year in tuition fees to study for an undergraduate degree at a UK university. Indian student groups and charities say many Indian students are not from wealthy families, and have to rely on part-time jobs to cover their living expenses. Sekhon says his small charity, which usually focuses on education projects, has been flooded with queries from students since being listed by the Indian high commission as a coronavirus support group. It has been delivering free hot meals and food to Indian students in Milton Keynes, Bedford and Luton for the past four weeks. He says the students are mainly from the universities of Cranfield, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire. “I don’t think universities fully understand what is going on,” he says. “Many of these students have been doing cash-in-hand or hourly-paid jobs, which they have lost. They can’t get home to their families, and they feel alone and don’t know how to access help like food banks.” A spokesperson for the University of Bedfordshire says: “Students don’t always highlight their difficulties and don’t contact our support team. We would urge students who are struggling to get in contact straight away.” The university can provide care packages and financial support as well as help finding work, she says. Cranfield University says it is aware of only one case of hardship. “Our student support and wellbeing team is looking into the details and will offer help,” it says. The University of Hertfordshire says is it offering wellbeing support, care packages, accommodation and food vouchers and has set up a new fund to help students in hardship as a result of the pandemic. Sameer Dhore, a student at the University of Greenwich and president of the university’s Indian Society, says: “Students are crying on the phone saying they want to see their mum or dad. The major issue is finance. Students are running out of money right now. There are students with nothing to live on.” The National Indian Students and Alumni Union says it has received thousands of queries from anxious students “trapped” across the UK, hundreds of whom say they do not have enough to eat. Sanam Arora, NISAU’s chairwoman, says: “A lot of students rely on part-time jobs, and now they have lost them they can’t pay their rent or buy food.” She says there is an atmosphere of panic: “The mental health issues are just flabbergasting. Some students have even threatened suicide.” The organisation has called on the Indian government to help get students home, and is backing a call by the UK’s National Union of Students for the UK government to do more to help. “International students are falling through the safety net,” she warns. Meanwhile, the Indian National Students’ Association said it had helped to distribute more than 3,600 rescue packages of groceries and ready meals to students so far. Of these, 90% were in England, although it has also supported students in Wales, Scotland and Belfast. Indian grocery stores and restaurants have been contacting the association offering spare food, and helping to get this to students in need. Prerit Souda, an INSA committee member, says that as well as being unable to buy food, some students have been facing eviction because they cannot pay their rent. “We connect them with legal experts, but in some scenarios students have been sub-contracting and that is much more difficult as they don’t have the same rights. In those cases we have been working with Indian community organisations to find them somewhere free to stay.” The Indian government has said the flights ban will continue until midnight on Sunday. Student groups, charities and parents are calling for students to be put to the front of the queue for repatriation. Universities UK, the vice-chancellors’ group, says all universities now have support systems in place. Vivienne Stern, UUK’s international director, says: “The first piece of advice we would give students is please, please contact your university. If they don’t know, they can’t help you. They might not be able to fix everything, but there are people on hand who want to help and listen to your problems.” Stern says some universities are going the extra mile to reach out to students, rather than waiting for students to come to them. These include Exeter University, which has been calling all remaining international students daily. Meanwhile, Bath University has moved students who were in halls in the city centre into rooms on its campus, and is providing three free meals a day. Meanwhile, parents and relatives back in India have been using social media to beg the Indian government to bring their children home. They include Dipti Taluja, whose 18-year-old son is doing a degree in sound engineering and music production at a private higher education institution in London. “It is very scary sitting thousands of miles away and knowing you are helpless and cannot do anything to bring back your child,” she says from her home in Gurugram, near New Delhi. Her son has been “very depressed”, she says, but is coping better after speaking to volunteers at NISAU. The UK Council for International Student Affairs has an advice page to help students.
219	The Rugby Football League’s chief executive, Ralph Rimmer, has warned clubs that the sport’s £16m emergency loan issued by the government is not to be seen as a “gravy train”, as he set out the conditions for how the money will be distributed to ensure the game’s long-term future remains intact. Clubs from across the professional game are expected to apply for much-needed funding, with Rimmer admitting many faced an uncertain future without the government’s help. The Guardian understands funding will be distributed based on projected revenue forecasts that were submitted to the RFL before the season began, rather than every club simply receiving the same amount, and Rimmer stressed they will not simply be issuing cash to clubs without good reason. “It’s certainly not a gravy train; there are conditions attached to this money and we’ll use it wisely to steer ourselves into a better place,” Rimmer said. “We have to make this last as long as we can. The sport took some drastic measures to cut its cloth when lockdown began, and none of those measured should be backtracked as a result of this. It’s not about dropping a lump sum in a club’s bank account and telling them to carry on as normal: we have to be far more meticulous.” Rimmer confirmed the sport’s professional clubs will receive the majority of the money, with the community game instead set to benefit from other initiatives with the likes of Sport England. Overseas clubs such as the Super League sides Catalans and Toronto, however, are not eligible to receive a share. “We’ve done some modelling on where we think the interventions will be required,” Rimmer said. “There will be some clubs that will require far more support than others, and we will use the money to get the collective through and use it responsibly.” Rimmer admitted dialogue would continue between the government and the RFL in terms of further funding and revealed the sport has started to put modelling in place for a potential resumption of the domestic season, which could include playing multiple games in single venues behind closed doors. Clubs are eyeing a return in either June or July, and Rimmer said: “There is the possibility of playing a number of games at one particular venue in terms of how we re-emerge in the first instance. We have to keep our clubs solvent and finish with some finals and big events, and there are several different models available to us.”
220	Even amid a roaring pandemic, there are currently two Americas: “Unemployment America” and “Stock Market America”, dueling lenses to view the same country. Unemployment America is bleak but in Stock Market America things are looking up. Taken together, this split reality portends a rough ride for the president’s re-election bid and even greater national discord. Donald Trump has every reason to worry. First, Unemployment America. On Thursday, the labor department reported that another 3.8 million people filed first-time unemployment claims, bringing the total of those who are recently out of work to more than 30 million. This cataclysmic data came on the heels of the steepest first-quarter GDP decline since the Great Recession, projections of a second-quarter GDP drop of 40% and an admission by Kevin Hassett, the president’s chief economic adviser, that unemployment could hit 20% by June, a level not experienced since the Great Depression. For a president who claimed to be a champion of the working class, this is an abject failure. The answer to the question of whether you are better off today than you were four years ago would appear to be simple. But it isn’t. At the same time as the economy is cratering and coronavirus’s death toll has surpassed the number of US troops killed in Vietnam, the stock market has rebounded from its March lows. As a result, its behavior under Trump still surpasses its performances during the Reagan and Bush Sr years. For how much longer is still an open question. On the other hand, as far as Barack Obama and Bill Clinton went, Trump isn’t even close. Still it’s a quantifiable achievement, and those close to the president and his campaign know it. In a conversation with the Guardian, a connected Trump campaign adviser took pride in the market’s April advance, expressed displeasure with the word choices of Trump’s economic advisers, and remained mute with regard to recent job losses. In Trump’s world, it’s the “stock market, stupid”. No wonder Jared Kushner boasts that the administration coronavirus response “is a great success story”, and opines “that’s really what needs to be told.” Can you say, “Mission Accomplished 2.0”? At the 1984 Democratic convention, Mario Cuomo, the late New York governor and father of Andrew Cuomo, the incumbent, riffed on Charles Dickens and delivered the most memorable keynote speech in recent history. Cuomo told those assembled that the nation was more a “Tale of Two Cities” than a “Shining City on a Hill”. To be sure, the speech won accolades but failed to resonate. Walter Mondale, the Democratic nominee, was shellacked on election day. Mondale’s problem was that by 1984 most of the US came to believe that it was Morning in America. The recovery was real, inflation had been drained from the system. Beyond that, President Reagan had not made the stock market the exclusive barometer of the country’s wellbeing. Rather, the drop in unemployment moved in tandem with the Dow’s rise. 2020, however, is a very different time and Trump is a very different president. Unemployment America is getting ravaged. The labor department’s latest report is also flashing red over key electoral battlegrounds. Michigan and Pennsylvania are among the states with the highest insured unemployment rates. At the same time, Florida and Texas are among the states showing largest numbers of initial jobless claims. Not surprisingly, recent polls show Joe Biden with small but persistent leads in Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania To put things into perspective, if those results hold on election day, Biden would be the 46th president and Trump would go down as an impeached one-term president. But now even Texas is in play, which last went Democratic in 1976. Back then, the ticket of Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale prevailed over a Watergate-stained Republican party. Indeed, the latest poll of Texas voters gives Biden a one-point edge. Beyond that, Texas’s emerging woes may signal problems ahead in the rest of the oil patch. There is a reason that the president reportedly threatened to sue his campaign manager and erupted, “I’m not fucking losing to Joe Biden” – because he possibly will. Trump’s Two Americas strategy appears devastating to working Americans and to himself. Lloyd Green was opposition research counsel to George HW Bush’s 1988 campaign and served in the Department of Justice from 1990 to 1992
221	Good morning. If there’s a big winner from the coronavirus, then it’s Amazon boss, Jeff Bezos. On Thursday his online retail corporation announced revenues of $74.5bn in the first quarter of 2020, 26% higher than the same period last year and equivalent to more than $33m an hour. Meanwhile, hundreds of workers in Amazon warehouses and Amazon-owned Whole Foods supermarkets are staging a sick-out on Friday, in protest at what they say are unsafe working conditions. An Amazon spokesperson said the company objected to “the irresponsible actions of labor groups in spreading misinformation”, while Bezos announced plans to plow $4bn into pandemic-related expenses, including personal protective equipment (PPE) and higher wages for workers. Amazon’s news came as US Labor Department data showed 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment since 21 March. That’s 18.4% of the entire working population, a level unmatched since the Great Depression. Rent strike. Thousands of Americans plan to participate in a rent strike on Friday, demanding state leaders in New York, California and Pennsylvania cancel rent during the crisis. Running water. A third of American households risk having their water shut off over unpaid bills during the crisis, and face exorbitant fees to be reconnected to the supply. Trump claims there’s evidence Covid-19 came from a Wuhan lab US intelligence agencies say they agree with the scientific consensus that the coronavirus was “not manmade or genetically modified”. But Donald Trump begs to differ: on Thursday the president implied, without details, that he had seen evidence to support an unproven theory that Covid-19 originated at a virology lab in Wuhan. Reports suggest the administration is pressurising intelligence officials to turn up proof of the theory, and analysts fear the president is looking for propaganda to prop up his attacks on China for its handling of the pandemic. On Friday, Trump will leave the White House for the first time in a month, to travel to Camp David. Whistleblower complaint. The government’s former vaccine chief, Dr Rick Bright, is preparing a whistleblower complaint after claiming he was dismissed from his role because he resisted political pressure to expand the use of a malaria drug touted by Trump as a potential Covid-19 “gamechanger”. A paroxysm over polls. Trump flew into a rage last Friday after being presented with poor poll numbers by his campaign manager, Brad Parscale. The president reportedly threatened to sue Parscale, telling him “I’m not fucking losing to Joe Biden.” Anti-lockdown protesters tried to storm the Michigan capitol Hundreds of protesters, many of them armed, tried to force their way on to the floor of the legislative chamber at Michigan’s state capitol in Lansing on Thursday, to demand an end to the state’s lockdown after the Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, requested an extension of her emergency stay-at-home measures. In California, the governor, Gavin Newsom, has closed beaches in Orange County after a backlash over pictures of crowds hitting the sand last weekend. Sam Levin asks how risky is a beach day, really?. Contact tracers. California is trying to follow South Korea’s example by organising a massive programme of testing and contact tracing, with San Francisco already enlisting an army of extra health department staff to meet the challenge. At least a million people have recovered from the coronavirus Some better news: more than a million people worldwide are now known to have recovered from Covid-19, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. South Korean health officials said on Thursday that a flurry of apparent reinfections were in fact a result of testing faults, providing reassurance that those who recover are most likely immune to reinfection. Denmark and the Czech Republic have eased lockdowns without a fresh spike in infections. But elsewhere in the world … … Russia recorded a record daily rise in infections, as the country’s prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, self-isolated after testing positive for Covid-19. … British black Africans and British Pakistanis are dying from coronavirus in English hospitals at more than 2.5 times the rate of the white population. In other news … Biden will break his silence over a sexual assault claim. The presumptive Democratic nominee is expected to respond to the allegation by Tara Reade, a former senatorial aide, in an appearance on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on Friday. Nasa picked Bezos and Musk to develop lunar landers. The US space agency has selected three private space companies, including Bezos’s Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX, to lead development on the vessels for future moon landings. A deadly virus is spreading exponentially … among bees. UK scientists say cases of chronic bee paralysis virus have surged in Britain and around the world. It causes severe trembling, flightlessness and death within a week, often wiping out entire colonies. Great reads How Gael García Bernal ‘fills the screen completely’ The young star of Y Tu Mamá También is now 41, and alternates between mainstream US movies and more politically charged Latin American work, such as Ema, his new film with the Chilean director Pablo Larraín. He tells Ryan Gilbey the “nirvana of acting” is “being able to go into places where you’re not sure what the hell is going to happen”. Life in Beijing with a quarantine handler Like many people in China, Lily Kuo has a Covid-19 quarantine “handler”: Ms Du, a mild-mannered, middle-aged local volunteer. To the outside world, China’s strict lockdown may look impressively draconian, writes Kuo. But on the ground, it feels more bumbling than intimidating. Trump tips the scales in America’s most powerful courts Tom McCarthy continues the Guardian’s series on Trump’s conservative takeover of the courts, by looking at how the president’s judicial appointments to three key appeals courts affect cases on issues such as voting rights and immigration. What plague literature can teach us about life after Covid-19 Shortly before lockdown, Marcel Theroux stocked up on great works of plague literature by the likes of Defoe, Camus and Thucydides. History’s pandemics all came to an end, but what did their chroniclers say about whether they changed society for better or worse? Last Thing: RIP Tony Allen, ‘the greatest drummer on Earth’ Tony Allen, the Nigerian drummer credited with establishing the Afrobeat sound alongside his late bandmate Fela Kuti, has died in Paris aged 79.

222	In times of fear, rules go out of the window and the default position is often one of force. A recent doorstep tribute in a Johannesburg suburb to applaud the efforts of essential workers was dubbed an “illegal gathering” by police summoned to break up the event. A resident remarked that it was an eerie reminder of South Africa’s past – a throwback to the times of apartheid. “The rules keep changing,” admitted one officer when it was suggested that the response was heavy-handed. No harm was done but the incident highlights the potential shifts in power dynamics that fear brings, as well as the disconnect between good intentions and how they are implemented. In unprecedented times Covid-19 remains an unknown adversary, with the African continent left to second guess its trajectory. So far it has not matched the terrifying numbers in China, North America and Europe, but it is early days. History shows how power thrives on confusion, and trade-offs between freedoms and security. These need to be constantly recalibrated – and science and politics need to work together. Leaders of 300 African civil society organisations are among 600 globally to have penned an open letter to heads of state urging adherence to the rule of law, warning that all responses should be evidence-based, “time-bound and proportionate”. In many ways lockdowns echo previous state crackdowns in the wake of terror attacks on the African continent. In Kenya and Uganda, emergency measures in response to violent attacks have amplified excesses of the security services. Covid-19 would appear to be no different; there are reports of killings by security services enforcing lockdowns in Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa. Like the terrorist threats, will the legacy of Covid-19 shape how countries are governed? Although – in a rare break with tradition – Kenya’s President Uhuru Kenyatta apologised for overzealous policing, now more than ever the need for tough executive oversight is clear. In South Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa has blended economic pragmatism with compassion, with a 500bn rand (£22bn) rescue package to support businesses and the vulnerable. His tough lockdown measures received international praise. Yet Ramaphosa’s response has arguably been soured by the revelation that 73,000 South African troops – virtually the entire national defence force – are to be deployed until the end of June. Military deployment should be a last resort, not a useful governance tool. Soldiers have been used to help build hospitals, distribute food and provide engineering assistance in countries such as the UK and Spain; in South Africa their role appears to be as enforcer. While the South African National Defence Force has a proud history of peacekeeping across the continent, its troops do not belong in the streets or crowded informal settlements. What would be their response to a rowdy food distribution for instance – restraint or firepower? Monitoring state excesses would traditionally be a job for the media. Journalists in South Africa have been afforded “essential worker” status, but in recent weeks have found themselves under fire. A camerawoman was shot at by police as she tried to capture footage of the lockdown. In Zimbabwe, a court earlier this month derided the police for using Covid-19 as a pretext for media harassment. Many African countries have demonstrated an admirable ability to leverage tech to assist in the Covid-19 response. Examples include bluetooth platforms used for contact tracing in Nigeria, WhatsApp live chats for providing health information in South Africa, and mobile money solutions for welfare payouts in Kenya and Mauritius. South Africa, with its long tradition of human rights struggles, has stopped short of copying South Korea’s introduction of wristbands to track citizens evading lockdown. But in the northern province of Limpopo, the use of drones by the police as a means of social control has almost gone unnoticed. Surveillance by stealth is a threat to be closely watched. While the assumption is that suspensions of our liberty are bonded with a sunset clause, the danger of “function creep” – where the application of a piece of technology is not as originally intended – is real. Not least in evolving democracies where oversight institutions are weak. Not wishing to undermine the clear benefits of emerging tech, function creep poses a risk to citizen rights given the fetishisation of, and uncritical reliance on, technology. Imagine if surveillance deployed to track Covid-19 was applied to migrants, alleged terrorists or the LGBT community, branded as undesirables by Uganda? We need to have a “kill switch” so that such technologies are not misused after the pandemic. At the very least we need to start the conversation. It is well documented how technologies developed as defensive tools by the military continue to find broader applications – not all sinister. And what of the vast troves of personal data that the monitoring of Covid-19 has collected? Will this have a shelf life? While the right not to be seen is protected in tightened-up data privacy laws, a global pandemic trumps such conventions. While many concede that extreme measures are required in the face of the spectre of mass infection in the poorest parts of Africa, will privacy overrides be reversed when this pandemic has passed? • Karen Allen is a consultant to the Institute for Security Studies and a former BBC Africa correspondent.

223	Heathrow airport has warned that it may soon follow British Airways in announcing mass redundancies unless the government restores confidence by planning for how flying could restart. The chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said physical distancing measures could not work in airports and common international standards for health controls were needed, such as temperature screening at the entrance to airports and the wearing of face masks throughout the process to ensure a low risk of transmission. Passenger numbers at the UK’s largest airport fell by 97% in April, and Holland-Kaye urged the government to take a lead in developing a global agreement for new measures. He said while forward bookings implied there was still “massive demand for travel”, it was vital to plan ahead. “If we don’t do that work now, the UK economy will not get back on its feet as quickly as it should. We must have a package of measures that does not involve social distancing … It is impossible for transport, let alone aviation … You need a queue a kilometre long for one plane with 450 people, if you need social distancing – the problem isn’t the plane it’s the airport,” he said. “We want to make sure that only people with a low risk of infection are travelling. That’s likely to include some form of temperature screening when you come into the airport.” Holland-Kaye said it would become normal for people to wear face masks and more parts of the airport process could be automated to reduce contact between passengers and staff. But he warned that without government planning, to ensure confidence that flying would restart, there would be widespread layoffs. Heathrow has already made a third of managers, about 500 people, redundant. He said many companies had been holding back on job cuts because of the furlough scheme but “aviation need more than that or it will be the last sector out of the crisis. BA’s announcement [of 12,000 redundancies] is just the first of many to go down the path – and we may follow.” There was a striking difference between the UK and how most countries had moved to protect airlines and airports, Holland-Kaye said, and although Heathrow – backed by sovereign wealth funds – did not need state support, the sector needed it. He said business rates at Heathrow were “now higher than our entire revenue”. Meanwhile, he called for any state aid for airlines to be linked to environmental targets. “There should be an obligation to get to net-zero as soon as possible and that should apply to aviation,” Holland-Kaye said. “There should be a commitment to the use of sustainable aviation fuels, and the government should stimulate production of synthetic fuel as a way of helping to reinvigorate the economy.”

225	My brother and I have always had quite a difficult relationship, but he cut off contact two years ago. I was suffering from severe anxiety and OCD at the time and he wanted me to travel two hours to meet him. He wanted to tell me in person that he and his wife were expecting a baby – I didn’t know this at the time and was just thinking about getting through each day, so I refused. I tried to reach out over the next few months and sent gifts for his baby. Then, when I got engaged, I called to invite him to our wedding. He never responded. He maintains a relationship with my parents and my sister, but apart from gritted politeness at my sister’s wedding I haven’t seen or heard from him. I am expecting my own child and, although I am happy, it is tinged with sadness at this loss. He clearly has grievances, but I am not sure what they are or how else to address them. Has anybody been through a similar situation? •When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help and may well view your comments here.

227	The 2001 Philadelphia 76ers are a tall tale that only grows unlikelier with time. The premise flatly stated is absurd: the Sixers built a ballclub around a 5ft 11in delinquent from Virginia Beach and it worked. Allen Iverson became the least conventional star ever to lead a team to the NBA finals and the Sixers became the ultimate underdog squad for the ultimate underdog city. From almost the day he arrived in my hometown aged 20, Iverson was plainly one of the NBA’s most transcendent talents, whose scoring instinct was amplified by a new-generation, kill-your-idols edge. His was the perfect game for the teenagers we were: reckless, almost violent, crackling with anarchic energy. It quickly became the greatest show in sports and it was happening right in our backyard. AI was just cool as shit. The whole city loved him. He was a singular but flawed talisman: who could win games by himself but refused to lift or do any real treatment, blew off practice because he was hungover, cursed out the coach and all but begged to be kicked off the team. Yet Iverson’s preposterous feats of bravery – watching him throw his 160lb frame into the paint, carom off the elbows of linebacker-sized defenders, score a bucket and then bounce off the deck to do it again – were his nightly penance and absolution for more than a decade. If clean-cut superstars like Jordan and Kobe strived to embody the (false) ideal of perfection, Iverson unapologetically spoke to the frailties innate in us. He was beloved because he was fallible. No team before or since has ever made a player that little the focal point and understandably so; deep down we knew the blueprint was doomed. But in 2001, it all came together. The concept was simple: the Sixers surrounded Iverson with selfless role players who wouldn’t get pissed the smallest guy on the court was chucking up 30 shots a night, their names familiar only because most were on their third or fourth team. The result was Iverson’s finest season. He became the shortest and lightest player ever to be named MVP, and the Sixers won with a lunch-pail style tailor-made for a town where people care a little bit too much about sports. Even as the injuries mounted during a grueling six-week playoff run – Iverson’s own list of ailments became almost comical – they kept ripping wins away from opponents in low-possession thrillers where your ass was not touching the seat for 70% of the game. The Sixers were given no chance in the finals against the seemingly invincible Los Angeles Lakers, the in-form defending champions led by Shaq and Kobe who hadn’t lost in more than two months. Even at full strength Philadelphia would have had their hands full, but the depleted Mash unit that arrived at the Staples Center for Game 1 of the series was written off entirely. The Lakers immediately showed why, rattling off 16 unanswered points behind the most physically fearsome big man in NBA history at his elemental peak. But after a patchy start Iverson caught fire, slashing and careening to the goal in transition, effortlessly shedding his perimeter defenders out of half-court sets and silencing the Hollywood plastics at courtside. By intermission he’d poured in 30, five off Jordan’s finals record for points in a half, as the Sixers built a lead that would swell to 73-58 in the third quarter. After watching Iverson shred Kobe and Derek Fisher for the first half hour, the Lakers looked way down the bench to Tyronn Lue, the seldom-used point guard who had spent the run-up mimicking Iverson against the Lakers’ first team in practice. Lue harried and hounded Philadelphia’s star relentlessly, denying him the ball or forcing him into contested jumpers. Whether borne from tactical genius or desperation, it was working. With Iverson in check, Shaq at his unstoppable best and my entire city hanging on every loose ball and rebound, the Lakers chipped away and sent the game to overtime. Then comes the part everyone remembers. The Sixers are clinging to a two-point lead with about a minute to go when Iverson receives a pass near the corner. He hesitates a half-beat, as if to assess his prey, before crossing over Lue and lofting a stepback jumper that hangs in the air for what seems like ages before ripping through the net, punctuating the coup de grâce with an exaggerated high-step over his fallen foil. Forty-eight points, five rebounds, six assists and five steals. Sixers take Game 1, 107-101. It was the apotheosis of the Iverson era and a Whitmanian triumph of the individual, a moment that struck so far beyond sports into the essence of our city’s insurgent soul, validating everything Philadelphia embodies and fiercely protected in our Allen: uncompromising, defiant, self-certain to a fault with a taste for the fight. The better team won over the best-of-seven series, as happens in basketball, but Iverson’s Game 1 masterclass has come to transcend the outcome in NBA history and define his place in the basketball pantheon: the greatest pound for pound to ever do it and a hell of a player.
228	Recently I’ve been trying to fill our plates with as much greenery as I can. We are shopping for food less regularly and buying veg in bulk, meaning greens are often not at their freshest by the time I use them. This week, I created two recipes that made use of tired greens; both are inspired by food photographer Joe Woodhouse, who is one of the most inventive vegetable cooks I can think of. All greens pasta (pictured top) This recipe is mainly about the sauce, which can be kept in the fridge or freezer and used for a hit of green with pasta or any grain when fresh reserves are running low. Here I’ve put it with some orzo and some buttery fried leeks, but almost any other veg would work. Prep 10 min Cook 20 min Serves 4 5 tbsp olive oil 2 onions, peeled and finely sliced 4 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced 3 tbsp white-wine vinegar 500g greens (such as kale, spring greens or cavolo nero), shredded 2 leeks (or another green veg of your choice) 400g pasta (I used orzo) Hard cheese (such as cheddar, parmesan, pecorino, comte), to finish (optional) Put a frying pan on medium heat, add a tablespoon of olive oil, then the onions, and cook for 10-15 minutes, until soft and sweet. Add the garlic and cook for another three minutes, then add the vinegar and let it evaporate. Next, stir in the greens and leave them to cook for a couple of minutes, so they are wilted but still have their colour (how long this takes will depend on what type of greens you are using – spring greens will take longer than kale, for instance). Put the lot into a blender with the rest of the olive oil, and blitz until you have a thin, green sauce, adding a little water if you need to loosen it. Prepare your other veg: I used leeks, which I cut into 2cm rounds and fried in butter until soft. Cook the pasta in boiling salted water to packet instructions, then drain, reserving a little of the cooking water. Put the pasta back into the pan and toss it with about four tablespoons of the green sauce (you might need more or less – trust your judgement), add a little of the cooking water to loosen, and then add the leeks. Serve topped with a good grating of cheese. Peanut butter roasted kale Roasting kale (or any green) until crisp in this peanut-buttery dressing elevates it from a likeable green to a snack that is fought over. Eat straight from the bowl or use to top soups, dal, rice and noodles. Prep 5 min Cook 20 min Serves 2 1 head kale or other green (roughly 500g) 1 tbsp sunflower oil 2 tbsp crunchy peanut butter (or other nut butter or tahini) 1 small thumb ginger, grated 1 splash vinegar or a squeeze of lemon or lime juice 1 tsp soy sauce (or a pinch of salt) Tear the kale or greens from the stalks. Rip the leaves into bite-sized pieces and slice the stalks finely. Mix the rest of the ingredients in a bowl with a tablespoon of cold water until you have a spoonable dressing. Toss the kale in the dressing. Lay the kale on baking trays in one layer (you may need two trays). Roast for 15-20 minutes, until crisp. Leave to cool before eating. I eat these as a snack or next to some buttered rice with lots of toasted sesame seeds and a fried egg.

248	Monday Anxiety is still the first feeling of which I am aware every morning. First as a sense of unease as I regain consciousness and then physical and mental distress as I reconnect with the reality of the new normal. It can still take me a couple of hours of hiding under the duvet before I feel brave enough to get up and have breakfast. Some things have changed, though. Thankfully my dreams are no longer quite so terrifying. Rather, they have switched into something more distant and desolate where I am disconnected from the present. One night I dreamed first I was with my son, who was learning to fly in the Lofoten Islands – somewhere I’ve never been (nor have I watched the TV series Twin) and would not be unable to place on a map of Norway – and then that I was in a spaceship with Buzz Aldrin as we were flying to the edge of the solar system. Buzz didn’t seem that pleased to have me for company. What’s also changed is that during the day some of the anxiety now dissipates into sadness and depression. Sadness both at the scale of the crisis – we are now well past the chief scientific adviser’s “best result” death toll of 20,000, with no end in sight – and at my own personal losses. In particular the separation from my family, friends and colleagues. In the early days of the lockdown I was somehow able to kid myself that maybe the quarantine wouldn’t last that long. But now it’s sunk in that the government is making things up as it goes along, life may not return to normal for many months and that all plans will have to be put on hold. I remember my mother telling me how she and some friends danced down Piccadilly during an air raid in the second world war (I’m assuming they were a bit pissed) before a warden angrily shepherded them into a shelter. I can’t quite work out whether I need a bit more or a bit less of that sort of spirit. Tuesday While almost every other sporting body has either cancelled or rearranged fixtures for the months ahead, the Premier League still appears to be under the delusion that it can not only somehow reschedule the remaining games of the current season but also start the next season more or less on time. I know the clubs don’t want to sacrifice any TV money or refund season ticket holders, but I can’t help wondering what part of the government’s coronavirus advice they have somehow missed. Clearly, as a Spurs fan, I would be more than happy for the current season to be declared null and void and for Champions League places to be decided on where clubs finished in May 2019, but I can see that might not be a universally popular choice. But someone has got to make a decision quickly, even if it means pissing some people off, as the situation is getting ridiculous. Still, at least there is someone I know who is still making money out of football. Louis, the son of my friend Kevin, is 42% up on his portfolio investment in the FOOTIE, football’s equivalent of the FTSE, where you buy and sell shares in footballers. Often ones you’ve never seen or heard of apart from a three-minute YouTube compilation. Louis’ best investment is a £10 stake in an Italian teenager, of whom I’d never heard, called Sandro Tonali – bought because he had a passing resemblance to Andrea Pirlo – now showing a profit of 220%. Despite a lengthy tutorial from Louis, I’m still not entirely sure how the FOOTIE really works – apparently Paul Pogba’s current value of £8 per share has fluctuated wildly in the past few months despite him not having played a single minute of football – but apparently it has become the go-to site for all fans with a few quid to risk who are overwhelmed by the mass monotony. Wednesday Some of my more intrepid colleagues have made a point of still going into Westminster so that they can observe 90% of MPs dialling in their contributions by Zoom on eight screens in the chamber. It won’t surprise you that I have taken a rather more timid approach, preferring not to take my chances on public transport and following proceedings via Parliament TV instead. I already feel I have used up most of my nine lives. The distance has done nothing to convince me that the government’s response to the coronavirus has often felt as if it has been getting worse rather than better. First we had Boris Johnson on his return to Downing Street declaring that other countries were looking at our apparent success. I wonder what an apparent failure would look like. Then we have had three contradictory briefings on Dominic Cummings’s contributions to the government’s scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage). First was that he had definitely never attended a Sage meeting. Next that he had been present but not involved. And finally, that rather than being a supporter of herd immunity as it had originally been reported, he single-handedly saved the UK by making the scientists introduce an immediate lockdown. We’ve also had Michael Gove talk up his HMRC academy for training 50,000 new customs officers (current applications = zero) to cope with new post-Brexit customs regulations, while Dominic Raab insisted the coronavirus was a magnificent opportunity for the UK to strike an advantageous Brexit deal with the EU by 31 December and that we shouldn’t believe everything Michel Barnier or the IMF say about the economy shrinking by 35%. But pride of place definitely has to go to Priti Patel, whose performance before the home affairs select committee was every bit the car crash that was anticipated. At one point, the home secretary told the committee that the reason the UK didn’t follow other government’s guidelines for self-isolation at airports was that we had both more and fewer international passengers arriving. Schrödinger’s airport. The public inquiry that will follow all this should make for compelling reading. Thursday Every crisis has its winners. The coronavirus has therapists, funeral directors and makers of sports equipment. With the change in temperature, I have finally had to admit I am basically a fair-weather cyclist. Pedalling my way up and down the same hill on a bike that is far too small for me for an hour in the wind and the rain really doesn’t appeal, and with it looking less and less likely that gyms will be reopening, something had to give. So I have found an online distributor that can deliver by 1 June – most manufacturers can now only promise July delivery, such is the demand – and I have ordered an exercise bike for £229, which means I will only have to endure another month on my wife’s bike outdoors. For someone who prefers their exercise to be dull, repetitive and painful, this is the ideal solution. Not least because it offers up the possibility of my own 24-hour-gym at home. If I can’t sleep because I’m feeling anxious, I will shortly be able to get up at 2am and cycle precisely nowhere to relieve the cortisol levels. What could be better? I’ve also ordered myself some resistance bands, which my friend Alex insists are nearly as effective as weights. If all goes to plan, I will be all sorted in case gyms are closed for a year. Though as soon as Virgin Active in Streatham does reopen, I will be one of the first back in to nab my favourite cross-trainer. I’ve always been a creature of habit and I’ve been going to the same gym for well over 20 years now, so why would I stop? Mens (in)sana, in corpore sano. Friday Before my wife took up pottery seriously about eight years ago, I had only a passing interest in ceramics. It was an art form I didn’t really get. But having watched Jill develop her work – and having lived through her many failures as well as the successes – pottery has become yet another serious passion of mine. To go alongside football, opera and Panini stickers. One of the things I most love about ceramics is the potters themselves. When you buy a piece directly from an artist, they are always keen to explain exactly how the work was made. What clays and glazes were used, whether it was thrown, handbuilt or both, and how many times and at what temperature the pot was fired. It’s as if ceramics is a form of artistic alchemy and even the creators aren’t entirely sure of how their work will actually look when it emerges from the kiln – and want to share the process with you. This week one potter called John, some of whose works we already have in our collection, took this to the extreme by not just sending me a pot he had made but including a letter, with accompanying photographs, of exactly how it was made. He had started by going to an old gravel pit in the Netherlands, where he had dug down to the 2.5m-year-old clay underneath, which he had taken back to the studio to be churned in a baker’s dough mixer before throwing it on the wheel. There was plenty more technical detail, but what I loved most was his end note. “Then of course there is my input into the making, the joy of throwing and all that happens along the way, be it philosophical, spontaneous, accidental, expressive, all of which play a part but may have different emphasis on the day of making.” I wrote some weeks ago that I have taken to talking to my pots. Some of my friends thought I was losing it a bit. But now, I feel vindicated. Because if you know a pot well enough, every time you look at it, it will talk right back to you. Digested week, digested: Mainlining Dettol.﻿
249	Sweden has persisted with the strategy of coronavirus mitigation that the UK government eventually abandoned in March. The policy is widely supported by the public, even though the Swedish Covid-19 mortality rate is among the 10 highest in the world, at 240 per million population and steadily rising, and many of the nursing homes in Stockholm are now affected. The typical explanation for this continued public support is that Swedes are trusting and unflappable. The country’s chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, the public face of the Swedish response to the pandemic, is after all a dry scientist-turned-bureaucrat, not some populist politician trying to whip up nationalist go-it-alone emotion. But beneath the surface, Sweden is anything but calm. The public debate is inflamed with a sense of wounded national pride. As a believer in the kind of liberal nationalism that encourages self-critical national attachment, this pains me. But as a scholar of nationalism, I recognise the pattern. This is what Isaiah Berlin called the nationalism of “the bent twig”, which lashes out against anyone who steps on it. It began with a self-conceit that seemed more comical than harmful. Why, one columnist asked, could we not just “let Sweden be Sweden”? Others suggested we brand ourselves “smart Sweden” or “kind Sweden”, the country immune to the hysteria of southern Europe. The next step was the ridicule and delegitimisation of opponents. A group of 22 scientists wrote a joint opinion column arguing for a drastic change of strategy. But within a few hours no one was paying attention to the substance of their arguments. Instead the debate came to revolve entirely around the fact that they used Covid-19 death numbers that made Sweden look worse than the more cautious estimates of the public health agency. This was certainly clumsy, but did not undermine their main conclusion. Nor does the fact that Sweden does indeed now have close to six times more deaths per capita than neighbouring Norway or Finland. Then came contempt for emotions, mixed with misogyny. Lena Einhorn, one of the 22 critics, was interviewed via videolink from her home. She broached research reports and numbers, but influential columnists focused on making fun of her hair or curtains. Her “hysterical” voice when describing the suffering of Covid-19 patients was also widely mocked. The detached response to her by chief epidemiologist Tegnell was hailed as evidence of his credibility. It is true that he speaks clinically about death in terms of statistical curves. But it is equally true that he did not offer much rebuttal of the research reports she quoted. From this trope of Sweden being alone in doing it right, we seem now to have shifted to denying that Sweden is doing anything exceptional at all. An opinion piece by a political scientist suggested that the Guardian had “blacklisted” Sweden, and that its reporting had described Sweden as “free from restrictions”. “Who would have thought Trump’s fake news would one day turn out to be somewhat real?” he concluded. But these claims are themselves untrue. The Guardian among others rightly reported the comparatively mild restrictions in Sweden. Nor was it “fake news” when Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported that Swedish doctors could soon be denying respirators to patients over the age of 80, and even those as young as 60 with underlying health conditions. In fact, this is now taking place. The public veneration for Tegnell has gone far beyond trust. He has become an icon, his face appearing on tattoos and baby garments. Writers otherwise known to cringe at any sign of nationalism describe him as the incarnation of Sweden’s soul. He should be named Swede of the year, says the former minister of public health. Serious newspapers run hagiographic stories on Tegnell and the general director of the public health agency, Johan Carlson. Pictures of their head offices flooded with flowers sent by private citizens are included. Some failures of the Swedish model have been acknowledged. But they are often linked to the lack of “compliance” of immigrants. Former chief epidemiologist Johan Giesecke explains the failure to protect the elderly in nursing homes with reference to “asylum seekers” and “refugees” on the staff, who “may not always be understanding the information”. This has met with silence, if not approval. It may already have been picked up by the Sweden Democrats, Sweden’s anti-immigration party, who now claim the health of elderly people has been put at risk for the sake of integrating uneducated immigrants. Defenders of the government’s strategy keep repeating that it is too early to evaluate it. But carrying that argument through to its logical conclusion suggests that veneration should also be postponed until the pandemic has passed. Any successful strategy should be transparent and welcome public scrutiny. My fear is that in our vehement defence of the Swedish approach, we have released forces we cannot control. As is clear for anyone who has followed Brexit, a nationalism unable to handle criticism can easily tear a society apart.

250	We’ll conclude our Australian rolling coverage of Covid-19 developments here. Thank you for your company and correspondence, commendations and criticisms, all of it a welcome and vital part of our community’s discussion. Be well, and stay safe. Tonight in Australia: 6,767 cases have been recorded in Australia after 14 new cases in the past 24 hours. 1,022 are still active cases, 83 people are in hospital, with 28 in intensive care. South Australia has had no new cases for nine days, Queensland for five. The death toll is 93 – NSW 43, Victoria 18, Tasmania 13, WA eight, Queensland four, SA four, ACT three. Twenty-one of the deaths were among passengers of the Ruby Princess cruise ship, four were on the Artania in WA and 13 were residents at the Newmarch House aged care home in Sydney. More than 3.5 million people have registered with the federal government’s tracking app Covidsafe since Sunday. On restrictions, closures and suppression measures: National cabinet will decide on relaxing some social and economic clamps next Friday, a week earlier than expected. Australia’s borders won’t reopen for at least three months, the federal government says. More than 340,000 businesses have received a cashflow boost worth over $6bn Aged care providers will get $205 million to help keep homes open to visitors through extra screening staff and protective equipment. More than 1.5 million people are on jobseeker, with 900,000 claims processed in the past six weeks. In NSW from midnight Friday, households will be allowed two adult visitors, and their children, under an initial easing of self-isolation measures. Most beaches are open for exercise, swimming and surfing only. In WA, up to 10 people are able to gather for non-contact recreational activities and outdoor personal training, while open homes and display villages will also be permitted. In Queensland, some stay-at-home restrictions will be eased on Saturday, allowing people to travel 50km from their residence to visit parks, have picnics and jet ski. Shopping for non-essential items will also be permitted. The Northern Territory is implementing a three-stage easing of restrictions starting with reopening parks and allowing people to golf, fish and swim with others from May 1 before restaurants and bars reopen with a two-hour limit on May 15. Bans on entertainment venues will be lifted in the third stage. Tasmania will on Monday ease restrictions in the state’s northwest which forced retailers and schools to stay closed. Victoria has no plans to lift restrictions until May 11 at the earliest. Victoria will launch a website showcasing live music and comedy performances on Sunday with creators given access to $2.35 million in grants. NSW students will attend school one day a week starting from May 11. Queensland will on May 15 review keeping children at home. No change has been flagged in Victoria. Western Australia hopes all students will return to classes by May 11 while 63 per cent of students have gone back in SA. Still open: supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, public transport, some schools, hairdressers, petrol stations, postal and freight services, bottle shops, newsagents, retail shops. Restaurants restricted to takeaway and delivery in most states. In other developments: Five Australian hospitals will receive the experimental drug remdesivir from US pharmaceutical company Gilead. Five defence force officers have been flown home after contracting the virus in the Middle East. 23 aged care facilities have had an outbreak, 15 have cleared it. The Guardian’s international liveblog continues here: And to the Northern Territory: The Northern Territory government insists its health system is prepared for a potential second wave of coronavirus cases, as four defence force members with Covid-19 arrived from overseas. The four returned from the Middle East on a routine Australian Defence Force flight that landed in Darwin early on Friday morning. It occurred a day after Chief Minister Michael Gunner laid out his road map for winding back coronavirus restrictions in three stages over five weeks, with all businesses including restaurants, bars, cafes and gyms to reopen. The NT had recorded no new cases of coronavirus since April 6, with only three of 28 people to test positive still recovering. There have been no deaths or community transmission, with all cases related to travel, but a second wave of the virus is considered a high risk, especially if restrictions are removed too quickly. The Australian Defence Force says it decided to test personnel “after being notified that a number of locally engaged contractors had tested positive” but did not say where the officers became infected.. The four were asymptomatic and taken to Royal Darwin hospital for assessment and placed in isolation. A number of other people on that flight went into mandatory quarantine, NT Chief Health Officer Dr Hugh Heggie said. A fifth ADF member who tested positive recently completed their deployment and returned to Australia and is currently in mandatory quarantine in Brisbane. “Defence will take all necessary measures in consultation with our coalition partners, relevant host nations and Australian federal, state and territory governments to ensure ADF personnel receive the treatment and care required,” the ADF said in a statement. The public were safe because everyone on that plane that landed on the Friday morning plane was in quarantine and not “walking the streets or in shopping centres”, NT Health Minister Natasha Fyles said. Fyles said the health department had done acute care scenario testing to prepare for an outbreak of COVID-19, it had a pandemic plan, and a lot had been learnt when repatriated Australians from China and a cruise ship were quarantined in Darwin earlier this year. NT Police Commissioner Jamie Chalker said Territorians had been wonderful in their compliance with restrictions so far and urged them to remain vigilant and maintain measures, such as physical distancing, with parks starting to open this long weekend. South Australia has enjoyed nine days of zero new Covid-19 cases. But the premier has warned against complacency, and lifting restrictions too early. From AAP: Talks of lifting South Australian coronavirus restrictions will begin in a week’s time but if done too early, could be a blow to the economy, the premier says. Steven Marshall said restaurants, cafes and pubs could open to a bookings-only system where social distancing and good hygiene would remain in place when restrictions lifted. “We may need to go back to the proprietor of that restaurant to find out who was dining there on a certain night if we find out someone had been infected and was present there, so there will be modifications,” the premier said on Friday. He encouraged South Australians to participate in non-contact sports, such as tennis, golf and lawn bowls, so long as they coincided with current restrictions. “As long as you’re not using the change rooms and facilities and keep the numbers under 10, we’re encouraging people to get out and play.” Marshall said more clarity around contact community and recreational sports could also be given from next Friday, now it’s been confirmed that decisions will be made by individual states or territories. Decisions on elite sports that require crossing jurisdictions will be made at the national level. “We know sport is part of our psyche here in Australia but we’ve got to do it in a way which is safe,” Marshall said. “We have to recognise that different jurisdictions are at different points along the curve in terms of the pandemic.” He said the cabinet will meet twice next week to further discuss the right way to incrementally lift restrictions. “We’ve got one shot to get this right here in SA. “We didn’t want to have this in-and-out orientation, releasing them and then putting them back in place a few weeks later. “It would have an enormous cost to the economy.” It comes as the state reported its ninth consecutive day of zero Covid-19 cases. The state’s total remains at 438 with 97 per cent considered recovered. There are no longer any patients in intensive care but three people remain hospitalised. SA Pathology has conducted more than 58,000 tests since February and although the two-week blitz has finished, the testing remains open to anyone who has minor symptoms. The Australian Digital and Data Council (you didn’t know we had one, did you) met today by phone: a meeting of the state, territory and federal ministers, as well as NZ’s minister for broadcasting, communications and digital media. The major topic was, of course, Covid-19, “the largest disruptive event the world has seen in many years”. The meeting reported that 3.5 million people in Australia have downloaded the Covidsafe app. “Ministers acknowledged privacy concerns are still front and centre for many people when deciding whether to download the app and were an important consideration in the app’s design.” The NSW government has released a statewide Covid-19 ‘heat map’, showing pandemic information by postcode. The map details the number of active cases, testing rates, and number of recovered cases in each local community. “This new way of showing NSW Health data will help communities understand the numbers of people being tested, and encourage more people with symptoms to come forward for testing when they see the impact COVID-19 is having on their local area,” NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian said. “It also provides encouraging data showing how people are bouncing back from the virus.” It’s accessible here. Cholera has largely been beaten in the west, but it still kills tens of thousands of people in poorer countries every year. As we search for a cure for coronavirus, we have to make sure it will be available to everyone, not just to those in wealthy nations. This is a fine piece by Dr Neil Singh. For coronavirus is not the only pandemic the world faces. There is another one raging right now. Since cholera first spread across the globe, two centuries ago, it has killed about 50 million people. In the time it takes you to read this article, another five people will have died from it. It is now mostly ignored in the west, but in other parts of the world, it has never gone away. The chief of Australia’s Defence Force, General Angus Campbell, has written to the families of ADF members, thanking them “for the continuous sacrifices that you and your family make in supporting us”. He said the role of Defence in Australia’s Covid-19 response was critical, “and I thank every Australian Defence Force member, their parents, partners and children for the patience, resilience, understanding and support they continue to provide so that we can continue to serve”. The ADF has established Operation Covid Assist, deploying military personnel within Australia to assist state and territory governments with contact tracing, planning and logistics, and working alongside police to enforce mandatory quarantine arrangements for international arrivals. Five members of the Australian Defence Force have caught Covid-19 while serving in the Middle East. On that note I am going to hand over to Ben Doherty. Stay safe, stay warm, and if you have any respiratory symptoms or a fever, however mild, please do get a Covid-19 test. My nephew (a reliable source) had one today and says they “tickle”. So I imagine adults can manage it. A reminder: In other news, if you, like me, are in Melbourne, you may have noticed that it is quite cold. Almost record-breakingly cold for the first of May, in fact, although the dial did just inch above 12C this afternoon. There has been significant snowfall across the alpine resorts, which just a few months ago were on fire or close to it. The ski season doesn’t officially start until next month so it’s possible coronavirus restrictions could by then be eased to allow some skiing. In the mean time, check out these beautiful photos. Here are a few more details on that study on the potential spread of the coronavirus in schools, which the WA government announced earlier in partnership with the Telethon Kids Institute. It will be conducted across 80 public schools, education support centres and residential colleges across WA, covering a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds. Participation in the study is voluntary, and requires the consent of both teachers and the parents of all children involved. That doesn’t mean you have to give consent if your child attends one of the 80 schools, only if they specifically are part of the study. The first part of the study involves surveillance testing of a sample of staff and students across 40 schools over three months, potentially longer depending on the number of cases detected. Parents will be advised of the outcome of tests and the tests used will be different to those at a Covid clinic. It’ll be a less invasive swab. That will start next week. Any positive tests will be subject to contact tracing, and any close contacts identified will “undergo multiple tests for Covid-19 at intervals over two weeks, irrespective of whether they show symptoms”, a WA government statement said. Close contacts will also be required to keep a diary during that period. This is intended to identify any onward transmission and “provide a greater understanding of the role schools play in the transmissibility of Covid-19 between students and staff, and the wider community via household members and other non-school contacts”. The third part of the study is about the psychosocial impacts of the pandemic. Also below the line folks, we will be switching comments off soon as our hardworking moderator is about to clock off. While we’re talking about sport, Mark McGowan was just asked about the prospect of AFL returning (they aren’t interested in rugby league in Western Australia). He said players would be subject to a 14-day mandatory quarantine, just like everyone else entering the state. The difference in the NRL seems to be that they plan to keep players permanently quarantined, apart from games. That’s why Queensland has granted them a free pass through the border. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, says she had a phone conference following national cabinet with the NRL chairman, Peter V’Landys, and the CEOs of the Broncos, Cowboys and Titans, and told them they could resume training for the season reopener on 28 May. In a statement, Palaszczuk said: I said I was as keen as anyone else to see the NRL return and I meant it. The only condition was that it did not put our excellent work containing the spread of COVID-19 at risk and the Chief Health Officer advises that the NRL plan is workable. She also demanded assurances that the NRL will enforce home quarantine, after reports of some players breaking restrictions this week. The decision means players have permission to travel across the Queensland border to play, effectively making them essential workers. First round games will be played in Queensland and of course I put in a bid for a local grand final and we all look forward to hosting the State of Origin. South Australia has recorded no new cases of Covid-19 for the ninth day in a row. That’s no new cases since 22 April. Cook is outlining a plan for a study, which will be done with the Telethon Kids Institute, to monitor and track any transmission of Covid-19 in schools. It will involve a random sample of staff and students who volunteer to be tested for Covid-19 over a period of three months. Any positive tests will be contact traced, and participants are required to keep a diary. The study will examine whether any of the transmission occurred at school. Cook says “all available evidence indicates that schools are safe and our commitment to this study should provide the community further assurance that we are taking all available steps” to ensure that schools are safe, and that any undetected spread at school is discovered. And a clarification on that earlier figure re the number of tests. Cook says the WA figures related to the number of people tested (which to date is more than 41,000), not the number of tests done. That’s why WA’s test figures could appear low compared to other states, because some states report the number of tests done and there can be multiple tests done per person. The Western Australian health minister, Roger Cook, says WA has the highest rate of tests per community transmission of the virus. Which seems to be quite an esoteric way to measure it. Still, a high rate of testing. Cook makes the point that the overwhelming majority of WA’s cases are imported. They’ve had a few cruise ships land. McGowan says WA recorded no new Covid-19 cases overnight. There are now only 32 active cases in the state, 23 locals and 11 from elsewhere. Only three of those active cases are in regional areas, in the Goldfields. Eleven patients remain in hospital, with three in ICU. More than 41,000 tests have been conducted. The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, is addressing the media in Perth. He starts by talking about a fatal police shooting that happened at the South Hedland shopping centre, which is about 1,500km north of Perth, a few hours ago. More on that here. McGowan says he would “like to thank everyone who has dealt with that situation ... those police officers. I would like to thank them all.” An Aboriginal woman, Joyce Clarke, died after being shot by police in Geraldton in September. A police officer has been charged with murder. Just after Scott Morrison’s press conference ended, the government announced another tweak to its childcare package to ease concerns about some services facing funding shortfalls. Under the temporary “free childcare” policy, parents are spared from paying any fees, but providers have been crunching the numbers and finding problems. While the general funding under the relief package was intended to work together with the jobkeeper wage subsidy of $1,500 per worker per fortnight, some services do not meet the test for the payment and those that do qualify cannot claim it for some casuals or work visa holders. The education minister, Dan Tehan, issued a statement this afternoon saying the government had expanded the eligibility for extra payments to childcare services that miss out on the jobkeeper wage subsidy. It says: Providers that are not eligible for the JobKeeper Payment, including non-government schools, large charities and not-for-profit organisations, will be eligible for a top-up payment. Tehan said the government would also help family day care and in-home care providers that were not eligible for jobkeeper and apply for an ABN by 1 June. You can read more about that here: Some more details on that one-off $205m payment to the aged care sector. It’s intended to facilitate testing by ensuring centres have adequate staff. The payment is linked to the number of residents at a facility. Providers will receive about $900 per resident in major metropolitan areas and $1,350 per resident everywhere else. The aged care Code of Conduct on Pandemic Procedures sets out the requirements for aged care centres to facilitate family visits. It can be viewed here. (This is the link the PMO provided, even though it says ‘draft’.) It comes after the aged care sector received criticism for, in some cases, shutting down facilities and not allowing visitors even when no outbreak was present. When there is a Covid-19 outbreak, a lockdown is allowed but communication with family members and residents must be swift and extensive. The code says that visits to residents should be short unless the person being visited is dying, or the resident has an established pattern of receiving visits that help in their care or support. When it comes to residents who are dying or in their final weeks, the code says, homes should be flexible with regards to the number of visitors at any one time and the length and frequency of visits. Erring on the side of compassion is important, given the difficulty in predicting when a person is going to die. Where visitors have an established pattern of always coming at a set time to help their loved one, for example coming to help with meals, “the length, frequency, and nature of the visits should reflect what is needed for the person to be cared for appropriately and consistent with established practices and routines”. While we are talking about sport, Scott Morrison, a keen Cronulla Sharks fan, refused to comment in that press conference on whether the NRL had been or would be given permission to resume its 2020 season. The league has set a return to play date of 28 May. More on that issue here: The national principles for the resumption of sport and recreation activities are 15 points long, so I won’t go through all of them. Point 13 is that sport, if resumed, will be spectator-free for the foreseeable future. The principles say the resumption of sport will be based on “objective health information” and that while the Australian Institute of Sport’s Framework for Rebooting Sport in a Covid-19 Environment will provide a “general guide” the final decisions will be made by state and territory governments. Other key points: Outdoor activities are considered lower risk. Community sporting activities involving 10 or fewer participants in a “non contact fashion” will be able to resume first before sport involving larger groups and full-contact sports. Physical distancing will have to be maintained. That will also apply to children’s sport. Golf, fishing, bushwalking, swimming etc will also be required to stick to physical distancing rules. “Significantly enhanced risk mitigation” must be applied to all indoor activities associated with outdoor sorts. So no shaking hands in the change rooms. The AIS framework is the minimum baseline standard required to be met before the resumption of training or match play of professional sports. Sports seeking specific exemptions must seek approvals from the relevant state or territory governments, or local public health authorities. At all times, sporting organisations must respond to the directives of public health authorities, including if ordered “quarantine of a whole team or large group, and close contacts, for the required period”. “For the foreseeable future, elite sports, if recommenced, should do so in a spectator-free environment with the minimum support staff available to support the competition.” The ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, has announced a very slight easing of restrictions. The definition of household units will be expanded/clarified to include children. Household units will now be allowed to visit each other, so adult children can visit their parents. Barr described this measure as a “down payment” on further changes to be announced next week, which he hints will include an easing of restrictions on the number of people allowed to congregate together outdoors. Barr also issued advice that non-essential retail is also allowed, like buying a winter coat before winter. Barr warned Australia has “still got a long way to go” and it’s “more a matter of when further outbreaks occur rather than if they do”. “The one race I am happy we’ve won [in the ACT] … is we have no active cases”. So, what did we learn from that press conference? Well, not as much as we may have expected. We know that the national cabinet has brought forward its decision on whether to ease those baseline shutdown provisions to next Friday 8 May. Previously the deadline was 11 May. Downloading the CovidSafe app is not mandatory, but Morrison says the number of downloads will be one of the factors considered. He will not say how many people need to have downloaded it, but suggests there need to be many more downloads for national cabinet to be comfortable with its ability to improve contact tracing. So: app not mandatory but strongly encouraged, particularly if you want to go back to the pub or play sport. On sport, a set of principles has been agreed to on allowing the resumption of professional and community sport, but no decisions have actually been made. Those decisions will be made next week. The biggest aged care providers have also signed on to a new industry code of conduct on managing the coronavirus, and the federal government has agreed to give them a one-off payment of $205m. And the chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said Australia will begin testing cohorts of asymptomatic people in an attempt to ensure early detection of any new outbreaks and avoid a second wave. That cluster testing will be focused on groups that have a high risk of exposure or work with vulnerable people, like aged care workers or healthcare workers. Teachers are among those who might get tested. Anyone with any respiratory symptoms at all – a cough, runny nose, anything – is now encouraged to get tested for Covid-19 and to avoid work. Murphy also comments: We weren’t at the the time of the view that information was being withheld from us. Morrison says an independent investigation would look at what happened and why it happened. So we can learn if something similar could happen in any part of the world so the world will be able to respond quicker. Because clearly in these cases time is everything. Scott Morrison is asked to comment on Donald Trump’s claim to have evidence to substantiate a theory that the coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Trump’s comment was made despite US intelligence agencies concluding that the virus was “not manmade or genetically modified”. Morrison says he has not seen any evidence to suggest that’s the case, but says Australia is still pushing for an independent investigation into the origin of the disease. What we have before us doesn’t suggest that that is the likely source. There’s nothing that we have that would suggest that that is the likely source, but you can’t rule anything out in this scenario. He says the virus did originate in Wuhan, but “the most likely scenario that has been canvassed related to wildlife wet markets”. That is why Australia wants an “objective independent” investigation, he says. While that can’t be ruled out, it’s not something we have seen any hard evidence of that that is the position. Guardian Australia’s Daniel Hurst asks if the free childcare policy will be extended past the initial three months. Morrison says it’s too early to say. A reporter asks if the easing of restrictions next week is contingent on more people downloading the CovidSafe app. Morrison says it is. He says if you want to go to the pub, you have to download the app. Now if that isn’t an incentive for Australians to download CovidSafe on a Friday, I don’t know what is ... that is a prerequisite to even getting to that conversation. There will not be any additional restrictions. We haven’t been considering additional restrictions, we have been out of that mode for some weeks ... but the degree, honestly, to which we can consider easing the restrictions we have now, that depends on how many people have downloaded the CovidSafe app. It really does. Morrison says the principles agreed to for restarting sport and recreational activities are based heavily on the Australian Institute of Sport’s plan. He says national cabinet has not made a decision on when and in what way sport can resume. That will be made next week. Among the principles are that outdoor activities are lower risk, and that there should be a staged resumption of sport. Possibly with smaller groups, less than 10 people in a non-contact sport, being allowed out first. Again, no decisions made yet: Decisions have not been taken to move on any of those matters but these principles set out the basis upon which we might be able to go forward when we set that out next week. Richard Colbeck is also the minister for sport. He says the return will be staged. We are currently in stage A – no sport. The next stage is stage B – outdoor, non-contact sports in groups of 10 or less. Then it’s stage C – all sport. He makes another plug for the app If you want to get out to play, download the app today. Both Scott Morrison and Brendan Murphy are asked for their opinion on Victoria’s deputy chief health officer, Dr Annaliese van Diemen, making a tweet. The state opposition has called for her to resign and reported her to Victoria’s public health commission. Morrison made some remarks on that earlier, and said he won’t comment further. Murphy defended van Diemen’s ability to do her job. She’s a fine young public health physician who has been working 80 hours a week for the past three weeks. She made a personal tweet on a personal twitter account ... I don’t personally agree with her but that’s a matter for her. A question on how people living in densely populated areas should deal with the easing of restrictions. Journalist: People are told “don’t do a Bondi”. What if people go down to the beach and see it’s really busy. Do they go home? Morrison says people need to “exercise commonsense”. Physical distancing, the requirement to remain 1.5 metres apart, will not lift when the restrictions lift. Those things would always have to be practised. So long as the coronavirus is out there then that is your best defence against it. Morrison says people should be motivated by their own desire not to get sick. I think people will be able to exercise judgment in their own self-interest. People walking into a crowded room ... will be putting their health at risk. Murphy: Whilst we are living with this virus the way that we interact with each other will have to be different and will remain different. Murphy is asked if the cohort testing of asymptomatic people will include testing of schoolchildren. He says no, but it will include testing of teachers. He says there has been cohort testing of asymptomatic schoolchildren, when a school reports an outbreak. There really isn’t a strong basis to test a cohort of children at this time. What about the NRL? Morrison says it’s a matter for state jurisdictions to clear or not clear any particular sporting codes. But the health advice to the states will be consistent and provided by the AHPPC. So each state should be saying the same thing to each code. In relation to the New Zealand Warriors being given permission to travel, Morrison says “no amount of reporting” will change that outcome. It has been received and is being considered. Will employers be requiring people to download the app, or will the government require businesses to require employees to download the app, before restrictions are lifted? Morrison says it cannot be required under law “but we are encouraging it”. It’s done on the basis of encouragement in the national public health interest and I have to say in the national economic interest. It is our path back to download the CovidSafe app. Morrison is also asked about the strained relationship with China. It is a mutually beneficial partnership. It is not a one-way street ... we will continue to work within that arrangement and pursue that relationship. To questions. I think Morrison just suggested he will try out Barre class, which is a joke that has run the length of this lockdown period and proved that we truly are starved for information. The question was asking for an indication of the kind of restrictions that might be lifted. Morrison says he won’t predict what national cabinet will decide. He says it will also be a matter of figuring out what mitigation measures can be introduced. Murphy is outlining the plan to ensure enough testing is done to detect any possible second wave of coronavirus. Australia will do cohort testing, identifying particular groups and testing asymptomatic people to ensure the virus isn’t undetected. Those cohorts include aged care workers, healthcare workers and hospital patients. (If they consent, of course.) Says Murphy: We need to test more people. If we are going to get on top of those small outbreaks ... we cannot afford to have an outbreak that takes off so that we get a second wave when we reduce restrictions such as a number of other countries have seen. So our testing has to be very good. He says that the case data shows that most people who transmit the virus do still have symptoms, so anyone with any symptoms should get tested. The most important thing in testing is for anyone who has respiratory symptoms, a cough or a cold or a sore throat, to get tested ... get tested and don’t go to work. Murphy says case numbers in Australia are now so low “that we can examine each case, each cluster, and get really detailed epidemiological information on what’s happening”. Murphy shows a slide using data given to the government from Apple and Google, showing how many people are on the roads. It has fallen substantially, showing people are obeying stay at home orders. A quip: Google does track people. The CovidSafe app does not. Murphy says Australia has beaten the modelling in terms of the number of new cases of Covid-19 reported. Pretty convincingly we have flattened the curve. There are now only two states on the graph showing the effective reproduction number. Last week the ACT and NT had dropped off the graph, because their case numbers were so low. The case numbers in every other jurisdiction are so small that the models feel that they can’t effectively use the effective reproduction number ... only in NSW and Tasmania are there enough numbers to show an effective reproduction number. Brendan Murphy is going through the requirements that need to be in place before restrictions can be eased. Australia now has enough testing kits and a secure supply line. We have enough masks and a good supply line, and the supply line for other PPE is being restored. The public health workforce needed to be ready to respond to an outbreak. Murphy says Australia has excelled in that space. Every state and territory now expanded so much in the very active stage of the outbreak that they are now able to stand down some of the workforce but they are there and ready to be active if we need them again. Murphy says that the requirement for improved contact tracing was almost there, “accept for the app uptake”. We need the app uptake to be higher before we can say that that final piece in the jigsaw puzzle of contact tracing is there. Australia currently has 6,765 cases of Covid-19. The chief health officer, Brendan Murphy, says we are “still consistently getting less than 20 new cases per day over recent days”. There have been 93 deaths. More than 570,000 tests have been done. Scott Morrison says Australia is expecting a 30% fall in overseas immigration in the 2019-20 year, on 2018-19 figures. In 2020-21, the forecast is for an 85% fall on 2018-19 figures. The aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, says all the major aged care providers, including Anglicare and BaptistCare, signed up to the new aged care code last night. It sets out rules and rights for people visiting their loved ones at the end of their life, and people who are used to receiving regular visitation as part of their care, such as dementia patients. Colbeck says “only 23 residential aged care homes” have had an outbreak of Covid-19 in Australia. (Weird use of “only”.) Fifteen of those residential aged care centres have now cleared the infection and in eight it is ongoing. Colbeck says most centres had only two or three residents with an infection. Among those who have now been declared Covid-free are Dorothy Henderson Lodge, the first aged care home to have an outbreak. At least six residents of that aged care facility died after testing positive to Covid-19. The aged care industry code has been agreed to by the major establishments in the aged care industry in Australia, and also interest groups in the sector. Morrison says the government is also making a one-off payment of $205m into the aged care sector to help it respond to the coronavirus and comply with the new industry code. National cabinet has agreed to a set of principles for sport and recreation, which will be released today, and also approved the aged care code. Morrison says there are now 3.5m downloads “and there needs to be millions more”. We need that tool so we can open the economy. So if you haven’t downloaded the app yet, download it. The app is voluntary, and the government has said it will not make individual participation in activities contingent on having the app on your phone. But it appears that our collective ability to get on with our lives will be tied to the app. So it’s over to you Australia. Morrison says national cabinet has brought forward its decision on whether the baseline restrictions should be lifted to next Friday 8 May. Australians deserve an early mark for the work that they have done. National cabinet will meet twice next week to work through the detail. Morrison says Australia has now met 11 of the 15 conditions set by the AHPPC for lifting restrictions. One of those conditions is downloading the CovidSAFE app. This is a critical decision for national cabinet when it comes to making decisions next Friday about how conditions can be eased. Morrison says that 1.5 million Australians are now on jobseeker and 900,000 claims have been processed in six weeks. This bears out the Treasury estimate that unemployment will rise to 10% and perhaps beyond. Scott Morrison says Australia has had “some real success on the health front” in dealing with Covid-19. There are about 1,000 active cases in Australia at the moment. But the coronavirus is “not the only curve we need to flatten”. He says we need to restart the economy, and get businesses open. We need to restart our economy, we need to restart our society. We can’t keep Australia under the doona. The prime minister has just started speaking in Canberra, joined by the ministers for aged care and sport. The national cabinet meeting was due to discuss a possible code of conduct for aged care homes responding to coronavirus, linked in part to the situation at Newmarch House in western Sydney. The meeting will also have considered advice from the AHPPC on reopening sport and recreation activities. Scott Morrison’s office has just issued an alert saying he will address the media at 2pm following the national cabinet meeting today. We understand national cabinet has been discussing the possible easing of baseline restrictions, and the meeting ran longer than usual, so this could be quite an interesting update. The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, is due to give an update at 2pm Perth time today, which is 4pm on the east coast. So, working backwards, we can expect an update from the prime minister on today’s national cabinet meeting some time between now and 4pm. I’m going to leave you for the day. Thanks for reading. Calla Wahlquist will take over from here. A teenage girl has been charged after allegedly spitting in a Sydney railway station staffer’s face and saying “I have Covid” before the man and his co-worker were allegedly punched by her friend. The 17-year-old girl tried to enter the Blacktown station on 23 April while smoking a cigarette before a male staffer approached to say smoking wasn’t allowed, NSW police said in a statement on Friday, according to AAP. She allegedly spat on the 56-year-old man’s face and said: “I have Covid.” A 16-year-old teenage boy, who is known to the girl, then ran over and coughed and spat in the staff member’s face, police said. A 53-year-old female Sydney Trains employee intervened and was allegedly punched in the head. The two teenagers then fled the scene, police said. They were arrested at a home in Pendle Hill on Thursday and the girl was charged with smoking in a public area and not complying with a Covid-19 direction on spitting and coughing. The boy was charged with two counts of common assault and not complying with the Covid-19 direction on spitting and coughing. They were both granted bail to appear at a children’s court on 14 July. Universities Australia chief executive Catriona Jackson has issued a statement while national cabinet is on. She said: Over the past two weeks state and territory governments have increasingly recognised and understood the difficulties international students are facing due to impacts from the Covid-19 global pandemic. Through no fault of their own, many of the more than 310,000 higher education students living and studying in Australia have lost their part-time jobs. They are not eligible for the same support local students can get through jobkeeper and jobseeker. To date, the Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australian, Tasmanian, Victoria and Western Australian governments have announced assistance packages for international students. Some support has also been offered at the Federal level. Jackson said a “nationally consistent approach to this challenge is vital”. Universities Australia is ready to work with all governments on developing sustainable, ongoing assistance that international students will require beyond the short-term. Ratings agency S&amp;P has downgraded stricken airline Virgin to D, the lowest grade possible, after the company’s administrators got payments on its planes frozen for a month and applied for protection from its US creditors. As Guardian Australia reported, the administrators – partners at Deloitte – have asked a court in the US to protect them from claims there by American creditors owed billions of dollars and prevent four planes that are being repaired in Nashville from being seized. D – for default – is the lowest credit rating S&amp;P can hand out. The agency said in a note: We expect that unsecured lenders will be forced to accept less value for amounts owing under the terms of the existing unsecured debt facilities as part of the anticipated debt restructuring and recapitalisation process. As Guardian Australia has reported, unsecured lenders who took a punt on Virgin in return for high interest rates are likely to take a hefty haircut. Estimates of what they’ll get vary from a pessimistic 7c in the dollar to a rather optimistic 65c. Well done, Canberra. Taiwan has been widely praised for its response to Covid-19 but is locked out of World Health Organisation discussions about the pandemic. Australia’s decision to support the island being granted observer status comes amid an already strained relationship with China over the Morrison government’s call for an inquiry into the cause of the virus. The government is yet to announce the Warriors have been granted an exemption, although clearly someone is briefing that it is going to happen. No doubt it will raise eyebrows among others who have been denied entry. From AAP: The Warriors have agreed to travel to Australia for the resumption of NRL training next week after seeking clarity from rugby league’s bosses. Peter V’landys spoke with Warriors officials on Friday morning, with the team expected to be headed to Tamworth once they gain approval from Australian border authorities. “The Warriors just wanted clarity on a few things and now they have got that they are fully supportive,” V’landys told AAP. We are awaiting a press conference after today’s national cabinet meeting, which is happening right now. It is expected there will be news on a roadmap to resume professional and local sport, as well as changes to aged care visiting rules. I might kick off by pointing you to this interesting piece by ANU anthropologist Michael Rose. Rose says that if there is a Australia-NZ travel bubble during the pandemic, as been floated, then it should include our Pacific neighbours, too. Hi everyone, Luke Henriques-Gomes here, taking over my Naaman Zhou. Thanks to Naaman for his efforts this morning. Scott Morrison has described some of mining billionaire Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest’s comments as “nonsense” on 2GB radio today. The mining magnate had said, on a podcast by the West Australian newspaper a month ago, that the virus could have originated in a country other than China. “It just might be Australia, it just might be Britain, it just might be China,” he said on 2 April. Today, Morrison was asked about these comments on radio after Forrest brought China’s Victorian consul general to a government press conference yesterday. The prime minister said: That’s obviously nonsense. I don’t think anybody is in any fantasyland about where it started – it started in China. It started in China. That is not a statement of accusation or criticism, it’s just a statement of fact. Yesterday, Forrest invited consul general Long Zhou to a presser with the health minister, Greg Hunt, without Hunt’s knowledge. The mining magnate then told commentators to “take a chill pill” over the uproar. He described it as “the biggest non-story ever”. I’m the most Australian person I know. Take a chill pill. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has released new data on the impact of Covid-19 on household finances, finding that nearly half (45%) of Australians aged over 18 years have been impacted. The results are: A third of Australians (31%) reported that their household finances had worsened over this period, while one in seven (14%) reported an improvement. The majority of Australians (81%) said their household could raise $2,000 for something important within a week, lower than the 84% reported in 2014. One in 13 Australians (7.5%) said their household lacked the money to pay one or more bills on time, and one in 10 (10%) had to draw on accumulated savings to support basic living expenses. It seems the Covid-19 economic supports might be part of the reason people are mostly still able to pay their bills: A quarter of Australians aged 18 years and over (28%) said they received the first one-off $750 economic support payment, announced by the commonwealth government in March. Those aged 65 years and over were more likely than those aged 18 to 64 to have received the first one-off $750 economic support payment (60% compared with 19%). The Queensland Coalition MP Andrew Laming has asked people to “call the police” on teachers if they do not let their children attend school. Laming, the federal MP for Bowman in Brisbane, posted the message in a video on Facebook yesterday. He said vulnerable students from poorer families were falling behind, AAP reports. Please, pick up your enrolment forms, hold them above your head, march into school, drop your kids off, and if they try and prevent those kids from going to school, call the police. This is witchcraft. We are back in the Middle Ages with these unions. In Queensland, schools are currently open but only for the children of essential workers and vulnerable families. The government will re-evaluate that on 15 May. Queensland’s state education minister, Grace Grace, said Laming’s statements were “a little bit idiotic”. She told AAP: This is from someone who I’m starting to think is acting a little bit idiotic and it is quite ridiculous. Every single school in Australia and around the world is impacted by this pandemic. So these outrageous claims, calling unnecessary anxiety and causing stress amongst our principals and teachers, are simply ridiculous. Labor leader Anthony Albanese has said that the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, should concentrate on his job and “what went wrong with the Ruby Princess” before he criticises Victoria’s deputy chief medical officer. Dutton – and many state and federal Liberal MPs – called for the deputy CMO’s resignation today, after she made a tweet comparing Covid-19 to the arrival of James Cook. But Albanese told reporters “I’m not getting into that”. People engaged in the health sector have a job to do at the moment protecting us on health issues. Peter Dutton has a job to do as well. He’s in charge of our borders and maybe he should concentrate on what went wrong with Ruby Princess before he goes outside those parameters. This does not mean the Labor preselection to replace retiring MP Mike Kelly has been completed, but Albanese says he “would expect that Kristy will receive strong support”. We will have a candidate by Monday afternoon. Nominations close at 12 o’clock on Monday, people are entitled to put their names forward. But I think that it’s very clear to me the best candidate is Kristy McBain. Albanese said earlier: “She is a strong and articulate person. She is someone who has been on the ground when the people of Eden-Monaro have needed people to be present.” Labor leader Anthony Albanese has just announced his preferred candidate for the Eden-Monaro byelection. Kristy McBain, the mayor of Bega Valley Shire, is his pick, and both are giving a presser right now. McBain says: I did not set out seeking this position but I want to take it on. I wanted to take it on for a couple of reasons. I am local, I am from the community and I have worked for the community for a number of years now. I don’t want my community to be left behind and at the moment, my community is being left behind. They are being forgotten My community has had three bushfires in two years. The whole of Eden-Monaro is drought-declared, or should be drought-declared, but it’s not. We are now in Covid-19, and with these three disasters happening concurrently, we do not and are not receiving the support that we need. Channel Nine reports that the New Zealand Warriors have been given special permission to enter the country for the resumption of the NRL season. The national cabinet has allowed Tamworth Airport to receive one flight – on Sunday at 4pm – carrying the Kiwi team. The team will have to quarantine for 14 days before they can play. The NRL is scheduled to start on 28 May. Some international freight flights will resume out of South Australia, AAP reports. Services out of Adelaide airport are set to resume, with Singapore Airlines planning to use passenger aircraft to carry 40 tonnes of cargo on 6 May and 13 May. The state’s trade minister, David Ridgway, said it would be a big relief for South Australian exporters. In many cases, exporters have had to ship their produce by road to the eastern states to fly out from there, at a considerable cost, and that’s if they were able to even access those outbound flights. And another exclusive – this time from Chris Knaus and Ben Smee. The Australian government entered a contract to buy 500,000 Covid-19 test kits from a company headed by a convicted rapist which had no experience in medical diagnostics, failed to deliver shipments at a critical point in the pandemic and is now under investigation by the medical regulator. The company, Promedical, told the Australian government it could supply huge quantities of test kits, but they have not yet arrived and Promedical have not been paid. Promedical’s chief executive, Neran De Silva, was convicted of rape in 2018 and was a one-time business associate of the government services minister, Stuart Robert, through a cryotherapy treatment business. Before Guardian Australia’s revelations, Promedical was given positive media coverage by the Today Show, the Daily Telegraph, the Daily Mail and Sky News and described as “revolutionary” and “amazing”. My colleague Melissa Davey has the exclusive story that negotiations are underway to supply five Australian hospitals with the experimental coronavirus drug remdesivir: The US pharmaceutical company Gilead is finalising the location of five hospitals in Australia to receive the highly sought-after experimental Covid-19 drug remdesivir. The only confirmed location is St Vincent’s hospital in Sydney ... A NSW Health spokeswoman confirmed the health department “has been engaging with Gilead on gaining access to the drug for Covid-19 patients”. The news comes as the doctor informing the Covid-19 response in the White House, the immunologist Dr Anthony Fauci, promoted preliminary findings from a joint Gilead and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases study that suggested remdesivir could improve recovery time of patients. His comments have revived global hope in the drug, with no treatments now available for the virus. But experts have warned that the study findings are unpublished and preliminary. Read the full story: National cabinet will meet today and is expected to discuss bringing back sport (both elite and local) as well as easing additional restrictions to aged care homes. Many care facilities have instituted enhanced rules, beyond what is legally required. AAP reports that “the principles for sport and recreation are set to be a headline issue” at today’s meeting. National cabinet will consider advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee about elite and community activities. Expanded testing is considered a key goal to trigger lifting restrictions at a national level. Leaders will also be given an update on mental health measures with a plan under consideration to better coordinate services. National cabinet will discuss an industry code for aged care, as governments move to ensure people are not isolated beyond the rules. Peter Gutwein adds that he is “looking at” easing restrictions across the entire state: I think it’s fair to say that we are starting to get on top of this and I think that over time, we will gradually be able to look at restrictions being lifted. But we will need to step into that carefully and cautiously, always with an eye to the fact that we have an older and more vulnerable population. Tasmania’s premier, Peter Gutwein, has just announced that the additional restrictions imposed on the state’s north-west will be lifted by Monday. Additional restrictions had been placed on the region due to a coronavirus cluster among health workers, which was traced to the Ruby Princess cruise ship. Up to 5,000 people who were healthcare workers and their families were placed under quarantine, and non-essential businesses and shops were banned. But on Friday Gutwein said these severe restrictions will be lifted, though the entire state would continue to have its existing restrictions. “We are confident that those additional restrictions, placed on the north-west on Sunday almost three weeks ago, the 12 April, will be able to lift,” he said. “Meaning on Monday the fourth of May, the businesses and services which were impacted by those additional restrictions can reopen, and the workers and staff will be able to return to work. “It’s important to note this will only be the lifting of the additional restrictions. The statewide restrictions in place in terms of personal movement, the operation of certain businesses, will still apply.” The north-west outbreak has been linked to 11 deaths so far. There are now less than 80 active cases in Queensland, with 11 people in hospital and four people in intensive care. There are still 2,700 Queenslanders in quarantine. It has now been 93 days since the state’s first case. Asked when Queensland could be declared “Covid-free”, Jeannette Young said it would take weeks. “For Queensland to be Covid-free, we would have to have no active cases and we probably have to wait for two incubation periods to be sure.” Queensland’s health minister, Stephen Miles, has announced there have been no new coronavirus cases over the past 24 hours as the state gears up to ease restrictions at the weekend. That means there have only been eight cases in the state this week. But Miles warned Queenslanders to still keep a 1.5-metre distance from other people, and not to become complacent. “Our message today is, this weekend, as we ease those restrictions, let’s not mess it up,” he said. “Let’s keep it up. Let’s keep getting the zero results.” The state’s chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young, said Queensland could then see more restrictions lifted in future. But that will depend on the weekend. “We’ll immediately get feedback about what people have done,” she said. “If we see large gatherings in places, that would concern us greatly and we’ll have to rethink.” But she says there was no reason for transmission to increase under the new rules, because people were supposed to only be primarily with their household. In the past 24 hours, Victoria police have issued 74 fines and conducted 651 spot checks. They fined four people drinking alcohol in a shopping centre carpark and 10 people who gathered at a private residence for a birthday party. Police have now conducted a total of 33,556 spot checks since 21 March. Here is the precise wording of the amendment to the NSW public health order that has allowed today’s relaxation of restrictions. A spokesperson from Gladys Berejiklian’s office told Guardian Australia that visiting friends would be considered beneficial for mental health and would, therefore, constitute “care”. Previously, the deputy premier, John Barilaro, also said you can “can visit family &amp; friends for any reason”. But, as always with enforcement, this can depend on the discretion of police, their interpretation of the law and what you precisely are doing. Daniel Andrews is speaking now. The Victorian premier says the state will consider “options we will have to potentially ease [restrictions]” in the lead-up to 11 May. But he asks people to continue staying at home for now, even as other states ease restrictions, because Victoria has had a higher rate of community transmission than other states: We have come too far, we have achieved too much for us to give that back, for us to fritter that hard work away. I know it is easy to think that well, with such low case numbers maybe the worst has passed, maybe this is over, I just want to remind every Victorian this is very, very fragile, we saw a spike in numbers just a couple of days ago, we have had outbreaks in lots of different settings. We have also had significant community transmission in Victoria as well. About 10% of our cases we can’t track them back to an overseas traveller. Not every state is like that. Some states have no community transmission at all. He also calls on Victorians to get tested for “mildest symptoms” and says the state has ramped up testing: The more tests we can get done in the lead-up to 11 May, the more options we will have to potentially ease some of the rules that I know are frustrating. NSW has recorded nine new coronavirus cases overnight. Gladys Berejiklian said this morning that the state had conducted more than 7,000 tests in the past 24 hours, with nine positive results. And the premier urged people with symptoms to get tested today, before the weekend’s expected flurry of activity once restrictions ease in the state. “Please come forward even if you have the mildest symptoms,” she said. “You don’t need to wait until Monday. You could be unintentionally passing on the disease without knowing you have it.” NSW’s chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said three of the nine new cases were residents at Anglicare’s Newmarch House aged care home, four were community transmission cases and one was under investigation. She also confirmed that the resident who died at Newmarch House yesterday was a 74-year-old man. The Australian stock market is set to open lower today after what has been a record month of growth. After the sharp falls at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, the past month was the best April for the stock market since 1988. But after a 2.4% rise yesterday it is expected to fall today, according to AAP. The SPI 200 futures contract was down 123 points, or 2.22%, to 5,417.0 points at 8am. In the US, unemployment claims topped 30m and Amazon and American Airlines’ earnings disappointed traders. In Australia, property price data for April is due to be published today. In some brief US news, President Donald Trump has just claimed, about 30 minutes ago, that he has seen evidence that Covid-19 was created in a lab. When asked if he had seen evidence that gives him a “high degree of confidence” that it originated in a lab in Wuhan, he said: “Yes, I have”. This is a direct contradiction of America’s own national intelligence community, and scientists. The director of national intelligence said: “The intelligence community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified.” Australia’s intelligence community has said similar. In today’s briefing, Trump appeared to discredit his own director of national intelligence when asked about it. A bit more detail on those relaxed restrictions coming in today and tomorrow. In Queensland, from Saturday: You will be allowed to go for picnics and non-essential drives, and national parks will reopen, but you are not allowed to travel more than 50km from your home. You can shop for non-essential items. The “two-person person rule” is still in effect, meaning that you can only be joined by one other person who isn’t in your household – and still keep physically distant. Previously, Annastacia Palaszczuk said people inside a home were allowed two additional guests. The Queensland border remains closed unless you are a resident or essential worker. In NSW, from today: Two adults and the children in their care are allowed to visit another person’s home, for any reason. You still have to comply with physical distancing – which means keeping apart, avoiding unnecessary contact and not crowding small spaces. There are no limits on how many guests someone is allowed a day as long as there are no more than two adults at a time. In WA, since Monday: Gathering limits increased from two people to 10. People are allowed to leave home for recreational activities including picnics, fishing, boating and camping. Maximum number of people at a wedding raised from five to 10. Border restrictions remain in place. Five Australian defence force personnel have tested positive for Covid-19 after contracting it in the Middle East. The five people are asymptomatic and arrived back in Australia this morning, AAP reports. They were were tested after a number of local contractors became infected with the virus. Four returned to Australia on Friday morning on a routine defence force flight and were taken to Royal Darwin hospital for assessment. The fifth, who had completed deployment, previously returned to Australia and is in mandatory isolation in Brisbane. The Australian defence force says it decided to test personnel “after being notified that a number of locally engaged contractors had tested positive”. “Defence will take all necessary measures in consultation with our coalition partners, relevant host nations and Australian federal, state and territory governments to ensure ADF personnel receive the treatment and care required,” it said on Friday. Another resident of Anglicare’s Newmarch House in western Sydney has died. Anglicare said the resident died yesterday afternoon, bringing the total number of Covid-19 deaths at the aged care home to 13. Yesterday the operator announced that three more residents had tested positive. There are now at least 37 who have contracted the virus, and 22 staff members. “This is a time of great grief for the family and we want to extend our deepest sympathies,” Anglicare said this morning. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in Australia this Friday. Restrictions in NSW ease today – with two adults (and any dependent children) now allowed to visit another person’s house for any reason. Restrictions will also ease in Queensland from Saturday, though travel will be restricted to within 50km. A flight from India will also arrive in WA today, bringing more than 100 Australians back. Overnight, around the world: Russia’s prime minister has been diagnosed with coronavirus. Mikhail Mishustin was supposed to be leading the country’s response to the pandemic but has said he will now self-isolate. Germany will ease restrictions, opening museums, galleries, zoos and playgrounds and allow religious services to resume. Brazil announced a record number of new cases in 24 hours (7,218). The death toll rose by 435 to 5,901.
251	Every morning these days, I challenge myself to fill the kettle and then stand at the stove … and wait until it boils. For the first month of quarantine, those four precious minutes between clicking on the gas to hearing the urgent whistle were my chance to run around the house, make sure the kids’ computers were charged for another day of remote learning, and quickly transfer the next load of laundry from washer to dryer. Now, I’m trying to embrace every opportunity, modest as they may be, to get well and truly bored. Quarantines have meant different things for people. It exhausts some as they spin from remote work to remote school and checking in on friends and family, all amid the miasma of disease and dashed dreams. Others are exhausted by vast stretches of open time, cornered at home with nothing to do but binge movies, scroll through Instagram and agonize. Some may crave solitude; others are suffocating in it. All this monotony is, for many of us, incredibly boring. But please don’t wish away your boredom. Despite its bad reputation, boredom is secretly powerful and quite wonderful. I began studying boredom six years ago during a creative dry spell. I was struggling to come up with ideas for my podcast. The feeling was more disturbing than my usual writer’s block, like sand filling my cranium. I responded with a pavlovian impulse to be productive. Every empty crack in my day was filled. Instead of staring at people’s feet on the subway, I attacked my inbox. Why wait idly for the barista to make my coffee when I could check the headlines or how many steps I walked? It was then that I realized this mental state itself was worthy of consideration, maybe even worth indulging. I decided to find what happens in our brains when we allow ourselves to get bored – when we just stand by the swings as our child goes back and forth for the hundredth time and don’t text someone. I wasn’t sure I could even manage to do that any more. But perhaps I should. Because what if the human condition of boredom actually has a purpose? The cognitive psychologists and neuroscientists I interviewed explained that when boredom strikes and our minds begin to wander, we ignite the default mode of our brain: a neural network where our most original ideas and problem solving happens. This neural network, discovered by neuroscientist Marcus Raichle 20 years ago, kicks into gear when we aren’t focused on a specific external task. Think of it this way. When you first get into the shower, you’re attentive, concentrating on getting the water temperature right and locating the shampoo. But once you’ve scrubbed your scalp, the water lulls you … and your mind drifts away … into the default mode. Though you’re ostensibly doing nothing, or seemingly mesmerized by a patch of grout, this is when the mental magic begins. Perhaps it’s on a small scale, like if you come up with an amazing way to sneak vegetables into your child’s meal. Or, it can be on a much grander scale, like if a biochemical researcher has a eureka moment in the shower and figures out a new way to save lives. Beyond presenting us with ideas, the brain’s default mode also facilitates a process called autobiographical planning, a neuroscientific term which refers to what our mind does when we daydream. Lying there, staring at the ceiling, we think back to high and low moments in our lives, take note of the good and bad times, and tell ourselves the story of … ourselves. Our personal narrative. We imagine the future, visualize ourselves in new situations, set personal goals and then concoct strategies. Think of the default mode as a time machine in your brain with which you visit your past and future personhood. After learning all this I began the Bored and Brilliant Project (and later wrote a book by the same name) for my podcast Note to Self, drawing 20,000 listeners all eager to see how being bored more often might change them. My favorite moment was when we all, simultaneously, deleted the app that we felt compelled to incessantly tap to relieve boredom instead of simply experiencing it. “I feel like I’m waking up from a mental hibernation,” one listener wrote. “I pick up my guitar more, sleep better.” Other stories included people who helped their child make friends at school, solved office conflicts, found ways to finish a doctoral thesis, and started a new business. One listener, Liam, removed every single social media app from his phone. He described the feeling of seeing no new notifications on his phone as a “kind of embarrassing emotional experience”, but, he said, “I like not giving my phone the power to decide that for me. So thank you.” Boredom isn’t all great. It has been found to trigger some unpleasant thought patterns, including rumination – going round and round in your head about mistakes or fears. Too much mind wandering can lead to anxiety or depression. There’s a lot we don’t know about how boredom works. Still, I’ve been hearing from a small but vocal contingent of people who are teaching themselves to embrace boredom while in quarantine. “My boredom has led me to searching for my passion,” wrote one. “I am reading more and am more focused than ever.” Startlingly, some young people have told me that they’ve never experienced boredom. One even said, “ I don’t think I could get bored because I can’t be alone with myself.” Quarantine grants us a gift: time. Time to clear out the dishwasher slowly. Time to go for a (socially distanced) walk without listening to anything. Time to lie on the ground while your child builds a fort around your head. We need to use this time wisely, embrace this uncontrollable ambiguity and reset our relationship to longer-term thinking. In meditation, we’re told to let our thoughts waft away. But when with boredom, I suggest you watch those thoughts carefully. See where they lead you. Don’t worry if you feel like you’re not doing it right. It can take time to pass through the uncomfortable side of boredom and into the empowering part. You might find embracing boredom jumpstarts your creativity too or, at the very least, relieves you from feeling any guilt about spending an afternoon on the couch doing nothing. You’re actually being productive – and just might change your life.
252	It was time to dispose of the aubergine. The one I acquired 39 days ago. Once firm, noble-seeming and purple, it now sat there looking forlorn – mottled in places, with a slightly jammy undercarriage. I picked it up several times on Tuesday and edged it closer to the bin, but I couldn’t bring myself to make the final push: chucking food would be an admission of defeat. This decaying, bulbous lump was symbolic, I realised. It meant I couldn’t just meal-plan and to-do list my way out of this mess. Covid-19 would still be here, causing havoc, at every level of my existence, whether I made soup out of mulchy salad leaves or raita from on-the-turn yoghurt. And, by God, I’ve been good and compliant and jolly resourceful for six entire weeks by now, eating rotting things that I didn’t quite fancy. Remember the banana bread stage? These were the same bananas still, just all hot and mushy now, but with one in the eye for the grim reaper. I’ve been saintly about food waste, avoided supermarkets, protected the NHS and not frittered money on Deliveroo, but, to be quite honest, it no longer really feels like winning. The aubergine needed to go. “This must be how Elizabeth I felt while signing Mary’s death warrant,” I thought, quite reasonably. This is the sort of inner monologue you have in total self-isolation, cooking for yourself and seeing no one, for more than a month. By June, this column will be mainly hieroglyphics and links to YouTube clips of static. Over the past six weeks, as restaurants shut up shop, the industry has grappled to work out if we’ll ever need chefs again. And at first I thought perhaps not - let’s all just stew our own aubergines. But now I know we’ll always need these people with their pans, stamina and imagination. All as barmy as a box of frogs, by the way (and I know a lot of chefs), but that’s all part of their charm. And eating my own home cooking, and only home cooking, has proved to me that life feels oddly flat when you remove other people’s flights of fancy. I am well fed right now, and I am nourished. I am fortunate, too. But I also feel as if I’ve gone by accident on a bad holiday, to a very remote, one-star TripAdvisor resort with only one restaurant, whose chef is diligent and well-meaning, but limited. Three weeks ago, I stopped bothering to shower for dinner because everything in every terrine – from the porridge to the pasta, and for breakfast, lunch and dinner – tasted oddly similar. Also, at 5pm daily, after the cha-cha lessons, they read out the latest death toll, but now I’m just quibbling. And in that light, Deliveroo’d vermicelli noodles and silver cartons packed full of battered stuff in bright neon, orange sauces begin to feel like a weird lifeline. I click on the web page, dawdling tantilisingly over the “open now” section. Dare I? Yes, I dare. Regardless where this virus leads us, there will in this weird new world definitely be a place for being cared for by others. And for that kind of Cantonese food that makes actual Cantonese people pinch the soft skin between their eyes in abject sadness, but that tastes fantastic as it’s forked directly into one’s gullet. We need it as much as “control” and “being good” and dal-ing our own lentils and turning that aubergine into sodding ratatouille. In recent weeks, I’ve craved burgers seasoned with, well, I don’t quite know what. At some pub. Any pub. It’s the chef’s recipe, and he’s not telling. Served in a fresh brioche bun. You know, one of those glossy buns that are frankly shocking for your weight, so I don’t buy them to have at home. But, gosh, do I miss someone else, an anonymous source, supplying me with them. I miss someone else lacing my food with far too much oil, or butter, or salt, because I’m just a stranger and they care little for my heart valves, but they want me to love their food and come back. I yearn for those anonymous figures, stood behind the stove, stirring good, freshly made pasta into silky sauces. I miss all the heat and light and extra happiness that you can’t really pull off at home: the sear of a very hot grill, a judicious handful of MSG, a deep tandoori lustre and laksa noodles that have been cooked in several complex stages. But, until then, I’ve got a bag of king edward potatoes with eyes and sprouts that need eating. I’m too guilty to bin them, too. There is eating to live, and living to eat, and I’ve learned which one I prefer.
229	Colin Graves will step down as chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board on 31 August, allowing Ian Watmore to take over after he was cleared of any wrongdoing by a review of his brief spell on the board of the Football League. Graves, who is now expected to run to become chair of the International Cricket Council when Shashank Manohar departs this summer, had previously extended his five-year term at the ECB by six months in order to oversee the first year of the Hundred. With that tournament now postponed until 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic, however, the 72-year-old former Yorkshire chairman and Costcutter magnate will pass the baton on to Watmore sooner, subject to ratification by the ECB annual general meeting at the end of this month. The appointment of Watmore as the ECB’s first salaried chairman has not been entirely smooth despite a strong CV that includes a background in business as chief executive of Accenture, 16 years as a senior civil servant, a short tenure as chief executive of the Football Association and time on the boards of various sporting bodies. A report last month in the Daily Mail highlighted a question mark over the 61-year-old’s conduct during a four-month stint on the board of the EFL, with the suggestion that a meeting held with Mel Morris, the Derby County owner, had prompted the threat of a breakaway league during a disagreement over a new rights deal. When announcing on Friday that Watmore remains chair-elect, however, an ECB statement said: “During an extensive process, that included a confidential review of the report referenced in media, the subcommittee has universally agreed that there was no evidence to support any allegation of wrongdoing on Ian Watmore’s part. In addition, it was concluded that the appointment process had been undertaken in a thorough and professional manner and the board now regards the matter closed.” The ECB review was overseen by the board directors Barry O’Brien, Katie Bickerstaffe and Martin Darlow, the first of whom had sat on the original nominations committee chaired by Lucy Pearson and overseen, from a county perspective, by the late David Hodgkiss, the former Lancashire chairman who passed away in March after contracting Covid-19.
230	Lawyers representing Jeremy Bamber, who is serving a whole life sentence for killing five members of his family in 1985, will ask the high court to review the refusal of the Crown Prosecution Service to disclose evidence they believe could undermine his conviction. They claim the material was made available to an author working on a televised drama about the killings, but not to his defence team. Earlier this year, Carol Ann Lee, the author of the book on which the recent ITV docudrama, White House Farm, was based, said Essex police had assisted her research by providing her with documents from the case. Lee posted an image on Instagram showing a series of numbered documents that have not been disclosed to the defence. She wrote on Instagram: “It was interesting to see and read all the original material.” The numbered documents taken from Holmes boxes (an administrative system introduced in 1985 to support major investigations) include files numbered 75/13 and 75/15, which Bamber says he has never seen. After Bamber’s legal team complained to the CPS the Instagram post was deleted. Bamber, aged 59, has spent the past 35 years sifting through millions of documents in an attempt to prove his conviction is unsafe. Because the files in the Holmes boxes are all numbered, he believes certain files have not been disclosed. The hearing on Friday in Leeds follows the refusal by a high court judge to judicially review the decision of the CPS not to disclose material to Bamber’s defence team. That was a “paper hearing” in which the judge considered the written evidence in private without representation from Bamber’s legal team. At Friday’s hearing, known as an oral renewal, the case will be fully reconsidered, supported by oral submissions from Bamber’s legal team. Bamber’s adoptive parents Nevill and June Bamber were shot and killed inside their Essex farmhouse during the night of 6-7 August 1985, along with their adopted daughter, Sheila Caffell, and her six-year-old twin boys. Bamber, then 24, had phoned the police to say Nevill had phoned him, saying his sister, Caffell, had “gone crazy and has the gun”. Initially, police believed that Caffell had fired the shots then turned the gun on herself. But, on 10 August, after the police ended their examination of the crime scene, a relative of Nevill and June Bamber, David Boutflour, found a silencer in the gun cupboard of the farmhouse. It was later said to contain blood belonging to Sheila Caffell. On 7 September 1985, Jeremy Bamber’s ex-girlfriend told police Bamber had discussed killing his family with her and that he was involved. On 29 September 1985 Bamber was charged with the murders. After the jury was sent out to reach a verdict, it returned and asked the judge for clarification on the silencer and blood evidence. The judge said it contained only the blood of Sheila Caffell. Seventeen minutes later, the jury returned and convicted Bamber by a 10 to two majority. In 2018 the Guardian revealed that a week before the trial, the head of biology at Huntingdon Forensic Science Laboratories wrote to Essex police saying the blood on the silencer “could have come from Sheila Caffell or Robert Boutflour”, another relative. That letter was not disclosed to the defence. The Guardian also revealed that a peer-reviewed report compiled by Philip Boyce, a ballistics expert at Forensic Equity Ltd, was sent to the CPS in 2019 about the possibility that there had been more than one silencer. The CPS has dismissed his findings, without employing its own expert to study his report. At the trial the prosecution argued that Caffell could not have killed herself because she had been shot in the neck twice. Earlier this year, the Guardian revealed statements made by senior police officers who attended the crime scene had been uncovered, stating that they had only seen one bullethole in Caffell’s neck. Again, these statements were not disclosed to the defence. Bamber believes other vital records have not been disclosed. Mark Newby a solicitor advocate at Quality Solicitors Jordans, which represents Bamber, said: “Since proceedings were issued it came to our attention that the author of the book the ITV drama was based upon appears to have received material directly from the police. “It cannot be right that an author has been given material that Mr Bamber’s defence team have not seen, particularly in light of the persistent refusal by the CPS to disclose specific material we have been asking for. It raises the question of whether a work of fiction is more important than justice.” Bamber, speaking from Wakefield prison, told the Guardian: “It is disgusting that a third party was provided with documents and sensitive photographs when Essex police and the CPS have been unwilling to hand over material to our own forensic experts to prove that two silencers were recovered from the scene. “Despite court orders being in place for them to make full disclosure to us, which they deliberately chose to ignore, when Carol Ann Lee requested material she was given it without a second thought. Where is my justice?” A spokesperson for Essex police said: “We are aware of the claim made by Jeremy Bamber and can confirm that this matter forms part of an ongoing judicial review. As this matter is therefore the subject of a forthcoming legal hearing it would not be appropriate for us to comment further.” On 1 May, the case was adjourned to 29 May. • This article was amended on 1 May 2020. The name of the ITV docu-drama was White House Farm, not White House Farm Murders. This has been corrected.
231	Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: China’s Hubei province will lower its coronavirus emergency response from the highest to the second-highest level China Xinhua News reports that central China’s Hubei province will lower its emergency response from the highest to the second-highest level starting on 2 May, citing a local official. The announcement follows months of strict lockdown. The virus was first detected in the province’s capital, Wuhan, in late 2019. England’s and Wales’s deprived areas have double death rates of affluent ones Residents in deprived areas have experienced double the death rates of those in affluent areas, figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal. Of the 20,283 Covid-19 registered deaths in England and Wales to 17 April, an overwhelming proportion of fatalities were of people from the poorest areas. The most deprived area had 55.1 deaths per 100,000 people, more than double (118%) that in the least deprived areas, where the rate was 25.3 deaths. Russia reported 7,933 new cases of Covid-19 in record daily rise Russia reported its biggest daily rise of confirmed coronavirus cases on Friday, with 7,933 new cases. The record daily rise brings the nationwide tally to 114,431, Reuters reports. The official nationwide death toll rose to 1,169 after 96 people with the virus died in the last 24 hours, Russia’s coronavirus crisis response centre said. Ryanair to cut 3,000 jobs as coronavirus grounds flights Ryanair is planning to cut 3,000 jobs and reduce staff pay by up to a fifth in response to the Covid-19 crisis, which has grounded flights. The no-frills airline said it did not expect passenger numbers or pricing to return to pre-coronavirus levels until summer 2022 at the earliest. As part of a programme of sweeping cost cuts, Ryanair said it could close a number of bases across Europe until air travel recovered. Queensland in Australia clears way for National Rugby League season to restart Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has opened Queensland’s border in preparation for restart of the National Rugby League (NRL) season on 28 May. Palaszczuk not only gave the green light for the state’s three NRL clubs to train at their base and travel interstate, but also host home games. One million people have recovered from coronavirus According to Johns Hopkins University data, more than 1 million people have recovered from coronavirus infection, with the total at 1,014,524. Infections worldwide stand at 3,269,667. More than 233,700 people have died in the pandemic so far. Trump claims he has seen evidence that Covid-19 originated in Wuhan lab When the president was asked if he has seen anything that gives you a “high degree of confidence” that coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Donald Trump replied: “Yes, I have.” His own government experts say the virus was “not manmade or genetically modified”. US intelligence agencies have been under pressure to link coronavirus to Chinese labs. Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, later said of the lab theory: “What we have before us doesn’t suggest that is a likely source.”
232	A founding father of one of Europe’s largest artist studio complexes has expressed grief, anger and a sense of betrayal after being told he must leave the community he helped create almost half a century ago. The contemporary artist Howard Silverman, 73, said his part in the development of Spike Island in Bristol had been his life’s work, and being given notice to vacate the studio he considered his spiritual home had devastated him. Fellow studio holders and artists from around the world are backing Silverman’s fight to overturn the decision, with some suggesting the organisation is intent on squeezing out older, established tenants in favour of younger ones. The New York-born Silverman, regarded as a cornerstone of the Bristol art scene, said: “I wake up in the morning stressed and depressed. It affects family, friends and colleagues.” Silverman, whose award-winning work includes installation, sculpture, painting, printmaking, video and digital imagery, is angry that, after spending 46 years at Spike Island and its predecessor organisation, the panel considering his bid to renew his lease had just 20 minutes to study it before debating and then making its decision. He is also distressed that after his appeal was rejected he was served three months’ notice to vacate during the first days of the Covid-19 lockdown, which would have made packing up and leaving even more difficult. “My studio is my spiritual home,” he said. “It has always been my laboratory and my launch pad. I will be lost without it.” Spike Island is the base for more than 70 artists, dozens of creative businesses and hundreds of fine art students. It began in the 1970s as Artspace Bristol, founded by Silverman and a group of other idealistic, radical artists who sought out and administered affordable studio spaces in old industrial buildings. In 1992, the organisation moved to its current home, a former tea-packing warehouse and rebranded as Spike Island. A trust was set up and last year introduced a system of lease reviews. Half of the six artists who have so far reapplied for their leases have been told they must leave. The Spike Island artist Julian Claxton said the decision to evict Silverman was outrageous. He said Silverman remained a “cutting edge” artist but always had time to encourage and help others. Another artist said he was the life and soul of the community, while a third said it was a “mystery” why he was being evicted. Within 48 hours, more than 500 people including artists from all around the world had signed a petition protesting against the eviction. A spokesman for Spike Island refused to speak about an individual case, but denied it was favouring younger artists. He said: “The studio review process is a way to ensure that our artists’ studios are managed fairly. Our [studios] must be inclusive and accessible to all in order to support local artists from different backgrounds and at different career stages.” The Guardian has seen a letter dated 26 March – after the coronavirus lockdown – from Spike Island giving Silverman three months to leave from that day – which would have involved planning the move during physical distancing. After he objected, Spike Island said the three months’ notice would begin after lockdown was lifted. The spokesman said Spike Island was being “incredibly flexible” with artists who were being told to leave. He confirmed the review panel members were given 20 minutes to read submissions from tenants, adding: “An extensive period of discussion then follows.”
233	The English Football League’s preferred contingency for promotion from the Championship if the season cannot be completed as normal would be to promote Leeds and West Brom, who are clear in first and second place, and to play the play-offs as per current positions to determine the final spot. The play-off semi-finals would see Fulham face Preston and Brentford take on Nottingham Forest and could be played as one-off ties at neutral venues behind closed doors, rather than the usual two-legged affairs. The Championship occupies a middle position between the Premier League, which is confident of finding the ways and means to finish the season, and League One and League Two, whose best efforts may not be enough. There are growing fears for the bottom two divisions because – with no widespread broadcast market for their games – playing behind closed doors would be a massive drain on finances. The Championship wants and intends to complete the season but as its clubs wait to be informed on how protocols for behind-closed-doors matches would work – and how difficult they could be to fulfil – it has been prudent to discuss contingencies that could offer some integrity to the final table. With the caveat that government and public health advice could yet override everything, the working theory is that if the Premier League could potentially play numerous matches, the Championship ought to be able to stage at least three to resolve its play-offs. It is unclear how it would work out the issue of relegation. What the Championship is banking on in terms of promotion is that the Premier League is able to finish and, in doing so, resolve its relegation spots. If it could not, with the standings so tight – four points separate 15th-placed Brighton from 19th-placed Aston Villa, with Villa having a game in hand – it would be extremely difficult to determine which clubs drop down on sporting merit. That unhappy scenario could open up a raft of legal challenges, either from relegated Premier League clubs or those from the Championship denied promotion. There would be the option of freezing relegation from the Premier League and allowing promotion from the Championship but an enlarged top-flight would bring its own problems. The leading Premier League clubs would rather, in an ideal world, shrink the division to 18 clubs. Bradford, meanwhile, have said it is increasingly likely no fans will be allowed at matches until next year. They said this was discussed in Thursday’s meeting involving the EFL and League Two clubs. “City officials have recently been informed of the ever-growing possibility of supporters being unable to attend matches until 2021,” the club said in a statement. “And it is now highly likely that next season will commence behind closed doors. This comes following a meeting yesterday.”
234	On 18 January, about 40,000 families in the neighbourhood of Baibuting in Wuhan gathered for a massive potluck meal before the lunary new year. Photographs of the event, proudly published in local state media, showed residents in festive red and yellow bibs digging in, reaching with their chopsticks for hundreds of dishes laid out on banquet tables. Five days later, the city was placed under lockdown and within weeks, there were several possible coronavirus infections in the neighbourhood. For months to come that banquet would be cited as an example of how little local officials had done to prevent the virus from spreading across their city. In the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, Chinese authorities are pushing for a “dining table revolution” to change long-held traditions of communal eating like those on display at the Baibuting meal, where diners take from shared plates with their own chopsticks. Authorities have launched an aggressive campaign to convince diners to use designated serving utensils known as gongkuai or gongshao, or “public chopsticks” and “public spoon”. Officials are also encouraging the serving of separate portions rather than “family style”, where a group shares several dishes. It will be a difficult feat to pull off. After the 2002-03 Sars epidemic, a similar initiative petered out. More challenging is that sharing food is a key part of Chinese social life and a sign of intimacy. The gongkuai – more common in Japan, Korea or Taiwan – tend to be seen at higher-end restaurants in China and rarely used at home. Among family or friends, asking for the serving utensils can be awkward or perceived as rude. “The obstacle is the traditional notion that we have to drink together and eat together and not show any distance,” said Q Edward Wang, the author of Chopsticks: A Cultural and Culinary History. “That kind of notion is well-entrenched in Chinese society as well as around the world,” he said. Under chopstick etiquette, taught at an early age, one should touch only the food one intends to eat. But Chinese health officials say the practice leaves too much opportunity for germs to be passed through saliva from one’s own set of utensils to the shared dishes. Authorities believe sharing meals was one way the virus was passed on in China, especially among families that accounted for 85% of infection clusters in Guangdong and Sichuan province, according to the World Health Organization. Across the country, celebrities, business tycoons, public health experts, and teams of propaganda workers have been deployed to educate the public. “Divide meals, not love,” state media have declared. In Ningxia in north-west China, a video tutorial by local state media tells residents in local dialect of a “new trend in civilised dining”. “Dividing meals and chopsticks is not dividing love,” it assures viewers. In Hangzhou, a local party member has called for 11 November to be designated “People’s Chopsticks Action Day,” given the date’s similarity to two sets of chopsticks. In Beijing, billboards call for citizens to join the campaign under the tagline: “Love is one more pair of chopsticks.” Starting in June, restaurants will be required to provide serving utensils and when possible to offer separate portions. The campaign appears to be working at restaurants. A manager at the Tianzhu chopstick factory in Zhejiang province told the Guardian the company has seen orders for gongkuai, which are longer and decorated differently, go up as much as 30%. At Huajia Yiyuan, a chain known for its Beijing roast duck, each place setting has two pairs of chopsticks and two spoons. At a popular hotpot restaurant on Beijing’s Ghost Street, all tables come with a set of the serving utensils. “Customers are very willing to use them,” said Lan Luoshi, 20, who works there. “If I go out with friends to eat or for hotpot, I will definitely use gongkuai,” she said. Changing habits at home and among the older generation may be harder. A common scene at family dinners involves relatives using their own chopsticks to put food on the plates of younger members of the family. Younger family members serve food to their older relatives as a sign of respect, while couples get food for each other in a show of affection. Many do not regard using the designated serving utensils as necessary at home. In a recent online poll by Sina Shanghai, half of more than 650 respondents said they would not use gongkuai or gongshao at home, agreeing with the response: “I won’t. We are all one family.” Chinese eating culture may be changing in other ways, away from crowded, bustling restaurants to quieter affairs. Many restaurants limit the size of dining parties to two and place tables at least 1 metre apart. Shi, 50, a chef at a noodle shop in a mall in Beijing’s Chaoyang district says he and his wife now rarely invite friends over. He recently noticed a group of co-workers come into his restaurant and naturally split into smaller groups, eating at separate tables. “The epidemic has already changed big things,” he said. During lunar new year in late January, authorities called on residents not to visit families, a key tradition for the holiday. “If the outbreak can change that, changing how we use chopsticks is nothing,” he said. According to Wang, it took hundreds of years for chopsticks to become the staple utensil. Changing modern eating habits, while difficult, should not take as long. “Customs are much more powerful than policy,” he said. “The pandemic and the government directives will provide some impetus. Gradually people will become more adjusted to the idea that even if we don’t share food, we are still friends.” Additional reporting by Lillian Yang
235	In the heart of the city that used to drive Lebanon’s economy, workers were busy with a rare jolt of enterprise, bolting steel plates to the ruins of its scorched banks. By dusk on Thursday, all of Tripoli’s ransacked branches were encased in armour, shielding piles of smouldering ash and rubble, but coming far too late to protect what had been inside. Over two earlier, violent nights, rioters had looted what they could. Six months after a revolution demanding action from a corrupt ruling class, and with a global pandemic now thrown in, its people are returning to the streets in rage at an enfeebled state that has largely left them to fend for themselves as the middle class sinks into poverty. Tripoli, a hub of a nationwide peaceful uprising last October that electrified the country, is now at the centre of something more raw and desperate – an increasing struggle to survive. The extent of the economic predicament has been laid bare in unusually transparent financial statements that have cast new light on Lebanon’s political structures and left many pondering the viability of a state that has withstood decades of war, occupation and chaos, but now appears adrift. “We have been executing something like this for 20 years, but not as bad as what we’re living,” said Fida Jundi Hajjeh, the manager of a Tripoli-based NGO, Sanabel Nour, which provides food and other aid to orphans and the impoverished. “The middle class has been demolished. In Tripoli, we’re all from the low socio-economic classes these days.” “As much as we can give is not enough,” she said as small crowds waited silently outside her office for food coupons. “The needs are so great that we sometimes feel we are not doing anything. There are so many employees who have stopped working.” Tripoli during daylight hours in Ramadan is usually subdued, but with the coronavirus closing shops and cafes and most arms of government shut down, its streets are sullen and still. That changes as night draws near, bringing with it the bustle of a normal day. There is no social distancin, and very few face masks to shield people from the virus. “You think we care about that when people can’t feed themselves?” asked Linda Borghol, as she stirred a large vat in a makeshift food kitchen. “Nobody has anything in Tripoli. Nobody can send money. Even if you can send, it’s not easy to collect it. People are literally starving.” Her NGO provides up to 5,000 people each day with basic sustenance, just as she has since the start of the October revolution. It was easier then, she says, as food was readily sourced, as were donations. But in the last month, the Lebanese currency – pegged to the US dollar since the end of the civil war 30 years ago – has collapsed. On Friday, it was trading at 4,000 lira to $1, after drifting steadily from its official rate of 1,500 lira. An economic package announced by the prime minister, Hassan Diab, on Thursday night fixed a new rate of 3,500 lira for the next 18 months, a move that would formalise at least a 50% price hike for nearly all goods and services, and set in stone prices that many Lebanese have no means to afford. Lebanon is a consumption economy that imports nearly everything and does not produce enough basic food supplies to sustain its population. The increased cost of imports has been quickly passed on. A freeze on many salaries, controls on bank withdrawals and slashed spending on social services, have also ravaged household incomes. The Lebanese government estimates that 75% of the population are now in need of aid, including food aid. Among refugee communities, the need for food aid rises to 90%, according to the International Rescue Committee. “Lebanon never had a productive economic model,” said Albert Leteyf, a partner at one of the country’s leading financial consultancies, Levantine Partners. “Its exports were its people, who sent money to their families. But that was never enough to fill the gap in the trade imbalance. “The [dollar] peg gave the Lebanese a sense of artificial wealth. It gave them buying power that did not correspond to the wealth of the country.” A belief has taken hold in Tripoli that the country’s political system has entrenched a permanent underclass “You think this government cares about us?” asked Borhol, waving her ladle. “We have to keep going. There needs to be change, or else what will all the people do, leave the country? Then the corrupt politicians will have nothing to rule. “When we go to the streets as revolutionaries, we carry stones like Palestinians. That’s all we have. The people are literally starving, and the government is failing them.” From his residence in the city, the former justice minister Ashraf Rifi said global politics remained a significant factor in the country’s current crisis. “There is a push me pull me game between the ones who stand with the Americans, and those who stand with the Iranians,” he said. “When the revolution began, people were not talking in sectarian terms, they were just stating what they wanted. Now they are talking about their demands and the politics as one, because you cannot have one without the other.” Rifi, a staunch foe of the most powerful political bloc in the country, the Iran-backed Hezbollah, said the party’s role in Lebanon had become insurmountable to those demanding a new form of governance. “To do something about it needs to be an international and regional decision. Only then can we meaningfully start to talk about change,” he said. “There has been a vacuum here for so long now. And when there is a vacant space, polluted matter will take it.” Additional reporting by Nadia al-Faour
236	Chinese ventilators that ministers heralded as vital to the NHS’s efforts to tackle Covid-19 were badly built, unsuitable for use in hospitals and potentially dangerous for patients, it has emerged. All of the devices in a consignment of 250 ventilators that arrived from China on 4 April posed such serious problems that they could not be used and were ditched. Doctors in NHS hospitals in the West Midlands, among which the ventilators were shared, were so concerned that they wrote to Matt Hancock, the health secretary, warning that they could kill patients. “We believe that if used, significant patient harm, including death, is likely,” they wrote in a letter, which was obtained by NBC News. “We look forward to the withdrawal and replacement of these ventilators with devices better able to provide intensive care ventilation for our patients.” The medics warned the Department of Health and Social Care that the oxygen supply in the devices was “variable and unreliable”, their build quality was “basic”, the oxygen connection base was marked as “non-EU” and their fabric case made them hard to clean. The machines were Shangrila 510 ventilators made by Beijing Aeonmed, a major manufacturer of ventilators in China. They were designed for use in ambulances not hospitals, the doctors said. The day they arrived, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister who is helping to co-ordinate the government’s response to the pandemic, thanked China for sending them. “We’ve been buying invasive ventilators from partners abroad, including Germany and Switzerland, and today 300 new ventilators arrived from China. I’d like to thank the Chinese government,” he said at the government’s daily news conference, in comments that were widely reported. However, hospitals that then received the devices could not get them to work, despite technical staff spending several days trying to do so. A senior official at one of the hospitals involved said: “All of the ventilators failed. Nothing worked. They didn’t have proper oxygen centres and the tubing didn’t fit. We were irate. All the hospitals tried to get them to work but we couldn’t. “At the time we were really worried, because we feared that hospitals were going to be overwhelmed with patients with Covid-19 needing to be ventilated. Happily, as it turned out we didn’t get quite as many as originally expected so we didn’t need the Chinese ventilators after all, which is just as well.” The ventilators were part of a government drive to increase the NHS’s supply of ventilators from the 8,000 it had before the virus struck, to 30,000, so that anyone needing one during the expected peak of the pandemic could have one while in intensive care. However, that target has since been reduced as hospitals have been able to manage the number of people with Covid-19 needing their care. A well-placed NHS source said the incident highlighted problems that had occurred with a range of medical supplies and equipment ordered from China during the coronavirus pandemic. “Some other stuff ordered from China recently, especially personal protective equipment, has also turned out to be either of a lesser quality than what we need or to be the wrong thing altogether, like T-shirts instead of long-sleeved surgical gowns,” they said. “You have to be careful who you procure stuff from, because the supply and then what ultimately arrives can be very variable. But, then again, we didn’t have enough ventilators to start with because the government was unprepared for coronavirus, so we had to ask China to help.” NBC News reported that it approached the international sales manager for Beijing Aeonmed, who said: “I don’t know,” when asked whether the company was aware of the concerns about its product, before the call ended. A government spokesperson said: “The Shangrila 510 ventilator model is not being used in hospitals and no patients are at risk. Ventilators need to pass robust regulatory tests to ensure they are up to standard before they’re delivered to NHS hospitals. “Our absolute priority in this global pandemic is saving lives and we are increasing our provision of ventilators to ensure the NHS continues to have the resources it needs, through procuring more ventilators from overseas, including over 4,000 from China, scaling up the production of existing or modified designs and working to design and manufacture new devices. We currently have around 10,900 mechanical ventilators available to NHS patients across the UK, as well as 4,300 non-invasive ventilators.” • This article was amended on 1 May 2020 to include a comment from a government spokesperson.
237	Britain’s financial watchdog is urgently seeking clarity from the courts over the insurance rights of companies whose business has been disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic. The Financial Conduct Authority, which says it still believes most claimants on business interruption policies do not have the right coverage to warrant a payout, is seeking a fast-track court declaration to “resolve uncertainty for many customers making claims”. The FCA is taking key test cases to court that provide the “greatest clarity” on specific policy clauses that represent those most frequently used by insurers which have been disputed by businesses who have been rejected for a payout. “We have been clear that we believe in the majority of cases, business interruption insurance was not purchased to, and is unlikely to, cover the current emergency,” said Christopher Woolard, the interim chief executive of the FCA. “However, there remain a number of policies where it is clear that the firm has an obligation to pay out on a policy. For these policies, it is important that claims are assessed and settled quickly. There are also some other policies where firms may consider there is no doubt about wording and decline to pay a claim but customers may still consider there is genuine uncertainty about whether their policy provides cover.” A group of more than 100 nightclubs, pubs and bars are planning coordinated legal action against the insurer Hiscox over its non-payment of business interruption insurance claims. Business owners have filed claims to Hiscox and other commercial insurers only to be told their business interruption policies do not cover the pandemic. The FCA also said on Friday that insurers may have to consider refunding some premiums or suspending monthly payments for customers who are not getting value for money from their policies during the coronavirus shutdown. For example, boiler cover insurers may not be able to deliver on offering an annual service at this time, and liability insurance may not be temporarily relevant for businesses such as hairdressers, bars and restaurants closed as a result of the government shutdown. The FCA said it would give insurers failing to deliver on the benefits promised in their policies six months to “take into account effects of coronavirus in a more rounded manner” and consider appropriate action. The FCA has also said insurance firms must look to help individual customers who are struggling to pay premiums due to the coronavirus crisis. The regulator, which has issued the same guidance in other markets including credit cards, overdrafts and personal loans, said firms must consider options including premium payment holidays, delaying charges or interest for missed payment and waiving administration and cancellation fees.
238	What has happened to Elon Musk? A highlight reel of the billionaire Tesla CEO’s activities since early March includes his pooh-poohing the coronavirus “panic” as “dumb”; keeping his northern California factory open in defiance of local public health orders; falsely asserting that children are “essentially immune” from the virus; providing a giant platform to promoters of an unproven and potentially dangerous treatment; predicting (inaccurately) that the US would have no new cases of Covid-19 by the end of April; attempting to re-open the factory before the end of the local shelter-in-place order; and calling shelter-in-place orders “fascist”. (Let’s not even get into the drama over whether the BiPap machines he donated to some hospitals count as ventilators.) Musk’s dissemination of misinformation about the virus is not without consequences. He has more than 33m followers on Twitter and a fan base that tends to exalt him as a cross between Tony Stark and God. A recent study published as a letter in the Journal of the American Medical Association Internal Medicine linked his tweet about chloroquine, an anti-malaria drug that was subsequently touted as a potential Covid-19 treatment by Donald Trump, to a dramatic surge in online demand for the prescription medication. “They weren’t aware of it, they weren’t interested in it – they were trying to buy it,” John Ayers, a UC San Diego professor of medicine and one of the study’s authors, told the Guardian in an interview. The chloroquine document that Musk shared was an example of what the infectious disease expert Carl Bergstrom has described as quantitative “bullshit” – the use of statistics and data to persuade someone by overwhelming and intimidating them, “without any allegiance to truth or accuracy”. Last week, Musk was apparently taken in by another pair of coronavirus bullshit artists, this time a pair of doctors from Bakersfield, California. Drs Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi held a press conference to promote the idea that Covid-19 is much more widespread and much less deadly than what “ivory tower” figures such as Dr Anthony Fauci have said. “Docs make good points,” Musk tweeted, with a link to a YouTube video of the 50-minute press conference. (YouTube removed the video for spreading misinformation, but not before it received millions of views; one of the doctors has gone on to make appearances on Fox News.) The docs did not make good points. After opening his remarks by defining “science” like a high schooler writing a term paper (“What is science? Essentially, it’s the study of the natural world through experiment, through observation, so that’s what we’re doing”) Erickson presented testing data from the chain of urgent care clinics they own. The clinics have performed 5,213 Covid-19 tests and had 340 positive results, which they claimed means that there is a 6.5% rate of infection in the local population. The pair performed the same math (positive tests divided by total tests) on the statewide numbers of 33,865 positive tests out of 280,900 total, to arrive at a 12% infection rate for the state. From there, they calculated that California has had a total of 4.7m infections and calculated that the death rate for people who contract Covid-19 in California is just 0.03% – much lower than that of the seasonal flu. None of this stands up to scrutiny. In order to assume that the rate of infection amongst a small number of people can apply to the entire population, you have to use a random and representative sample. But the people who are getting tested at urgent care clinics in California are neither random nor representative; they are people with severe symptoms or who are performing certain essential jobs. Figuring out the actual infection rate across the broader population will require careful sampling that avoids this selection bias. The Bakersfield duo used their meaningless numbers to argue that shelter-in-place orders must be lifted – a position that Musk clearly also holds. (In an extraordinary joint statement, the American College of Emergency Physicians and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine “jointly and emphatically condemn[ed]” the pair, and suggested they were “releasing biased, non-peer reviewed data to advance their personal financial interests without regard for the public’s health”.) The issue is not that Musk has staked out a contrarian stance on the coronavirus. There are difficult debates that need to be had over how and when to restart the economy in order to minimize long term economic harms and maximize public health. We can and should have that discussion, and we should do it without impugning the moral character of everyone who argues for a faster loosening of restrictions. But it’s increasingly difficult to take Musk seriously when he makes his argument by cherry-picking numbers or relying on blatant misuse of data. Please, make your case, but make it using real facts, and not by playing fast and loose with numbers in an effort to mislead the public about what is actually happening. Otherwise you look and sound a lot less like the brilliant engineer and entrepreneur, and a lot more like just another used car salesman.
239	Last year, I accomplished a major life goal. It wasn’t buying a house, learning Greek or finishing my novel. No: I “completed” Seinfeld, having spent most of the summer watching every one of the sitcom’s 169 – or 180, depending on how you count it – episodes, from pilot to finale. The sitcom, co-created by Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, which chronicled the life of rising comedian Jerry and his friends George, Elaine and Kramer, ran from 1989 to 1998, and is available to stream in the UK on All 4. Last September, Netflix acquired it in a reported $500m (£400m)-plus deal and it will join the streaming service’s library next year. Although 2019 wasn’t anywhere near approaching the doom-laden, apocalyptic hell-storm that 2020 is shaping up to be, it was nevertheless no Sunday picnic, and thus a retreat to the relative calm of the Seinfeld era – the late 80s to mid-90s – was welcome therapy. This is perhaps why, in the midst of a global pandemic, I have returned to Seinfeld. I’m now making my way through the best 25 episodes, according to this list. There’s a tendency to idealise this pre-internet era. I was born in 1987, so I was two when Seinfeld first went on the air. The 90s are now being mined by younger generations and the decade has been having a fashion moment for a while now, with many women dressing in long floral dresses that resemble Elaine’s and men in Kramer’s hipster patterned shirts. As an older millennial, I have actual memories of the 90s, and so returning to that era has a comforting familiarity to it, from the clothes to the decor to the cultural references. Being part of that “bridge” generation, which experienced life before and after the widespread use of the internet, Seinfeld offers a glimpse of the kind of adult life we just missed out on, where dating politics revolved around the telephone and people were always getting ready to go out to the movies. In reality, I know that 1990s New York was far from wholesome. And yet there is something quite gentle about an entire sitcom episode based around trying to get a parking space (these days, you’d use an app for that) or a controversial loaf of rye bread. It’s a common misconception that Seinfeld is “a show about nothing” (this, in fact, is the pitch for Jerry and George’s failed TV sitcom-within-a-sitcom, a recurring meta-subplot throughout the series). Its original aim was to show the everyday events behind a comedian’s material. It is this hilarious focus on the seemingly mundane aspects of everyday life that makes Seinfeld a work of comedic genius. This is why George’s answering machine theme tune reduced me to tears of laughter recently. It’s easy to forget that, long before teenagers were making their own TikToks, people who were supposed to be fully grown adults were devising their own ridiculous, themed answerphone recordings. It’s a phenomenon that, like choosing a film at the video rental store (also a mainstay of Seinfeld), is now obsolete. In 2020, it would be much more difficult to masquerade as a marine biologist or to escape being broken up with by avoiding answering phone calls from your girlfriend, or to persuade your friend that the working title of War and Peace was “War, What Is It Good For?” Living in what has been termed by some as a “cancel culture” is also a factor in the comforting nature of Seinfeld. Larry David may have recently come out in defence of Woody Allen, but I’m not about to stop watching the show. The characters are so amoral that there’s a sort of freedom to how they are so unfettered in their ability to be their terribly behaved, authentic dirtbag selves without being held to such high moral standards. That’s not to say that there aren’t aspects of Seinfeld that haven’t dated in terms of attitudes and prejudices, but much of it has aged remarkably well. It’s intelligent, too: I know of no other sitcom that would devote so much comedic attention to the works of John Cheever, for instance, or have a recurring joke about a fictional arthouse film (Rochelle, Rochelle: A young girl’s strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk.) Like much of 90s television, Seinfeld takes place in a world before mass-surveillance capitalism. It is notably lacking in consumerism, and by the time Friends hit TV screens, a notable shift had taken place. Friends has the reputation of being the ultimate nostalgic comedy comfort watch, but all of the best bits were taken from or inspired by Seinfeld, just with “better looking people” and added hugging and learning (memorably banned on Seinfeld). Whether you have retreated into Seinfeld or are streaming other 90s TV series such as This Life, Frasier, Dawson’s Creek, Ally McBeal or My So-Called Life, there are worse places to be than the 1990s. Namely, the present. Not to mention the fact that Jerry’s germaphobia looks a lot more rational these days. In fact, you could say that we’re all Jerry now.
240	Under a small, sun-baked mat, a curled metallic-gold slow worm lies basking in the heat, the dark stripe running down its body revealing its youth. Sensing attention, it begins to wriggle away, revealing a companion, which speeds rapidly into the grasses in the opposite direction. After a winter of social distancing, slow worms – a type of legless lizard that grows up to half a metre long and is often mistaken for a snake – have been venturing out of hibernation to enjoy warming their cold-blooded bodies in the spring sun. Picnics may be out for now, but an assortment of rugs and mats placed around Sutton Ecology Centre, a secluded two-hectare nature reserve tucked away behind a main road in Carshalton, south London, are playing host to a more subterranean kind of socialising. The amorous slow worms, which come in an array of polished silvers, golds and browns depending on age and gender, mate for up to 10 hours at a time in May; there’s a good chance that peeling back the corner of one of the mats in the centre during peak season will reveal two entwined. “It is always a treat to find one,” says Barbara O’Keeffe, a retired local resident who has volunteered at the site for eight years. “When you gently pull back one of the mats to look, for a second you think there’s nothing there, then there’s a glint of gold.” Though they are rarely seen out in the open, slow worms are common throughout the UK. But the ecology centre – which packs in woodlands, wildflower meadows, and a pond currently teeming with tadpoles and wildfowl chicks – is a hotspot. “It is positioned at the point where the chalky North Downs meets London clay, in an area fed by one of only about 200 chalk streams in the world,” says David Warburton, senior biodiversity officer for the London Borough of Sutton, which owns the centre. “The site is ideal for reptiles such as slow worms. We have a really healthy population of them, but they are isolated by surrounding roads and housing.” The reptiles – which live for up to 30 years (the oldest on record was a captive 54-year-old male in Copenhagen zoo) – feast on slugs, snails and insects. In turn they provide food for various birds, as well as badgers and hedgehogs – numbers of which have declined dramatically in the past two decades. Like all six of the UK’s reptile species, slow worms are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act, making it illegal to intentionally kill, injure or sell them. But this doesn’t stop them regularly falling victim to carelessly wielded shovels, a risk that could increase as lockdown increases the amount of time people spend in their gardens during the slow worm mating season. “Just be mindful that they’re around,” says Warburton. “They are not at all dangerous. If you find one, be careful not to spook it, or it could shed its tail – which is their main defence mechanism. But by all means get close and marvel at how great they are, look at their eyelids, ear holes, forked tongue, and then leave them where you found them.” Leaving out covers such as old rugs or corrugated iron in a sunny spot can encourage them into the garden, he says. O’Keeffe recommends a bit of messiness in the garden to create a more holistic ecosystem: not mowing areas of lawn, leaving piles of logs and leaves, and ensuring gaps under fences to allow hedgehogs and other animals in and out. “We often have a stall at local events and I remember one lady being delighted, saying ‘Oh, I’ve been feeling guilty about the wild patch at the bottom of my garden … now I’m going to call it my wildlife area.’” In normal times the ecology centre welcomes 7,000 schoolchildren a year. The species that call the wildlife centre home, not least the population of slow worms, are a big draw. “Lots of kids haven’t got any frame of reference for things … snails, worms, everything’s ‘icky’,” says Warburton. The loss of half of the world’s wildlife is at the forefront of the centre’s work. “I don’t think that most people have cottoned onto the fact that there is a biodiversity crisis,” says Warburton. “We teach the kiddies so that they care and will do something about it. Activities like building a stick den, picking up a snail – it helps them to not be scared to get their hands dirty. We try to turn their fear into fascination.” An understanding of natural processes isn’t always better among local adults, according to Warburton, especially in urban areas. He describes the reaction of the public when his team introduced native cattle to the Roundshaw Downs in 2012, a rare chalk grassland three miles south-east, on the site of London’s first international airport in Croydon. They used castrated male Sussex cattle, which are naturally hornless and very placid. “Well, you’d think we’d released lions. Some people were apoplectic. I had to say: ‘This is not Jurassic Park we are creating!’” He wonders if the current crisis might bring about a shift in people’s interest in their local wildlife, including the mysterious slow worm. “Hopefully they might realise you don’t have to go to a national park to see cool and interesting species. Once you’ve seen them in your garden, the whole world opens up.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features
241	Shortly before the London lockdown, at an eerily quiet branch of Waterstones, I managed to get my hands on The Decameron, by Boccaccio, and Daniel Defoe’s A Journal of the Plague Year. But Camus’s The Plague had gone the way of dried pasta and toilet roll; there was just a desolate gap on the shelves where the copies had once been. The primary lesson of plague literature, from Thucydides onwards, is how predictably humans respond to such crises. Over millennia, there has been a consistent pattern to behaviour during epidemics: the hoarding, the panicking, the fear, the blaming, the superstition, the selfishness, the surprising heroism, the fixation with the numbers of the reported dead, the boredom during quarantine. Defoe would have recognised the impulses behind the strange tableaux of life interrupted in central London: piles of ice melting outside abruptly closed bars; a truck unloading gym equipment at an oligarch’s house in Mayfair; jittery shoppers with overloaded trolleys. “Many families,” he writes, “foreseeing the approach of the distemper laid up stores of provisions sufficient for their whole families, and shut themselves up, and that so entirely, that they were neither seen or heard of till the infection was quite ceased.” The sudden, powerful need to know what’s coming is predictable, too. We turn to historical witnesses who can explain what it’s like. Defoe’s motive for writing A Journal of the Plague Year was an outbreak of bubonic plague in Marseille in 1720. Anticipating its spread, readers wanted to know what it had been like in 1665. Defoe, responding to demand, provided them with an instant book, fashioned out of statistics, reminiscences, gossip, anecdote and blood-curdling dramatic detail. “Passing through Token-House Yard in Lothbury, of a sudden a casement violently opened just over my head, and a woman gave three frightful screeches, and then cried, “O death, death, death!” Defoe almost certainly didn’t witness this – he would have been about five. Novelistic moments such as these would make the book compelling at any time, but right now it has a painful relevance. Defoe is particularly strong on the unpreparedness and prevarication that made the impact of the plague more severe. Or, as he puts it: “I often reflected upon the unprovided condition that the whole body of the people were in at the first coming of this calamity upon them; and how it was for want of timely entering into measures and managements, as well public as private, that all the confusions that followed were brought upon us, and that such a prodigious number of people sunk in that disaster which, if proper steps had been taken, might, Providence concurring, have been avoided.” Defoe is sometimes dismissed as a hack, but his lack of vanity about his prose is one of the things that gives the book its power. There’s something amazingly bracing about his vividness and curiosity – the bills of mortality, quoted in full; minor characters such as the religious fanatic Solomon Eagle who walks around naked with a pan of burning charcoal on his head; and the imprudent John Cock, a barber who is so relieved by the apparent retreat of the epidemic that he returns to normal life too soon and pays the penalty. Moral: don’t be a John Cock. So much of the behaviour of our 17th-century forebears is uncomfortably familiar. The citizens of east London watch complacently as the plague tears through the West End, and assume they will be fine. They’re proved terrifyingly wrong. Defoe adds in a chilling parenthesis: “For indeed it came upon them like an armed man when it did come.” Even before germ theory, Defoe’s common sense and perceptiveness led him to conclusions of which our chief medical officer would approve. He gives a prescient warning about the danger of asymptomatic carriers: “The plague is not to be avoided by those that converse promiscuously in a town infected, and people have it when they know it not, and that they likewise give it to others when they know not that they have it themselves.” If human behaviour remains dismayingly constant, one thing that has changed for the better is science and our understanding of it. Seven hundred years on, there’s something deeply poignant about Boccaccio’s pre-scientific description of the spread of the Black Death in his native Florence. “What was particularly virulent about this plague was that it would leap from the sick to the healthy whenever they were together, much as fire catches hold of dry or oily material that’s brought close to it. And that was not all. Not only did speaking with the sick and spending time with them infect the healthy or kill them off, but touching the clothes of the sick or handling anything they had touched seemed to pass on the infection.” You feel like the audience in a pantomime, wanting to shout across the centuries and tell him who the villain is and how he operates. Not everyone responds to plague by immersing themselves in data about epidemics. The escapist response to disaster is another predictable move and The Decameron epitomises it. After his short but terrifying description of the Florentine plague, Boccaccio sends his troupe of young characters into quarantine, where they spend the remainder of the book, swapping funny, ribald stories: the plague doesn’t feature again. It’s a welcome relief to lose yourself in a world of cuckolds and randy nuns. And once more, plus ça change. The gilded Florentine youths are doing the 14th-century equivalent of binge-watching Sex Education on Netflix. Thomas Mann and Camus are less interested in plague itself than in using it to make existential points. The plague in Death in Venice is an avatar of death in general, the terrible mystery, the pale horse; it is something that strips away vanity and reveals unpalatable truths. In Mann’s novella, it is the catalyst for Von Aschenbach’s humiliating descent into clownish self-destruction. At the same time, the pages dealing with the cholera epidemic are vigorous and apposite. The hotels in Venice empty swiftly, despite official protestations that there is nothing to worry about. It’s a young English travel agent who finally cuts through the official flannel. The doubts he raises about administrative competence and probity are ones that in due course we’ll all be obliged to consider. “‘That is,’ he continued in an undertone and with some feeling, ‘the official explanation, which the authorities here have seen fit to stick to.’” Camus is the real odd one out. The Plague is often read as an allegory of the French experience under occupation, but right now there seems nothing allegorical about it: the hero, Dr Rieux, seems like a naturalistic depiction of a frontline care-worker forced into impossible decisions over who gets a ventilator. At other historical moments, the constant reflection on the meaning of the plague could seem heavy-handed – Gallic, not in a good way – but in 2020 it’s like reading The Crucible while your elderly parent is on trial for witchcraft. For long stretches, you forget any notion of allegory and simply wonder how Camus could have got it so right: from the panic buying of peppermints that people think will be a prophylactic, to the high mortality rate in the municipal jail, to the exhausted healthcare workers, and the terrible monotony of quarantine, something with which we are only just beginning to get acquainted. And then, of course, the plague ends. That’s the actual good news that these books bring. The epidemic always passes. The majority of people survive. Thucydides himself had it and recovered. “I shall simply tell it as it happened,” he promises of the plague that ravaged fifth-century Athens, “and describe the features of the disease which will give anyone who studies them some prior knowledge to enable recognition should it ever strike again.” Should it ever strike again is the phrase that awakens our sense of hubris. For all the talk of an unprecedented crisis, we are living through something with many precedents. “There was particularly high mortality among doctors because of their particular exposure,” Thucydides wrote 2,500 years ago in a sentence that could appear in tomorrow’s paper. We have assumed that deadly epidemics belonged to a phase of history that was behind us, as quaint and irrelevant as candlelight and milking your own cows. When the number of fatalities finally peaks and dwindles, Defoe’s citizens pull up their windows and shout to each other to share the news. Camus’s Oran is liberated; its citizens struggle to make sense of what has happened to them. Back in fifth-century Athens, the Peloponnesian war continues. Whether society changes for the better or worse, or simply stays the same, is what we will find out.
242	San Francisco has assembled an army of librarians, social workers, attorneys, investigators and medical students to find and warn anyone and everyone who may have been exposed to Covid-19. Large-scale tracing efforts have been proven to work in other countries, including South Korea and Germany, and are considered crucial to get the United States economy back on track. But tracing efforts in a nation as large and diverse as the US come with unique challenges, and California, the country’s most populous state, is one of the first to start to take those challenges on. To set up an effective contact tracing program, California will have to increase its health department staff five or 10-fold, experts told the Guardian. The state is eventually planning to recruit 10,000 tracers, according to Gavin Newsom, the state’s governor – and test up to 80,000 people each day, relying on paid health workers and volunteers. But some municipalities are ahead of their curve, and are already beginning to recruit and train tracers. Putting in place a system for tracing and tracking the contacts of people who have tested positive is a “is an absolute essential pillar we need to build up and put in place before we even think about reopening the country”, said Susie Welty, a global health expert at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), who is helping build the contact tracing program in the city. Despite its techie reputation, San Francisco has so far eschewed smartphone tracking and contact tracing apps in favor of old-fashioned phone calls. Experts from UCSF have recruited more than 100 city workers who cannot do their regular jobs under the current shelter-in-place rules, taught them healthcare privacy laws, and coached them on how to call Covid-19 patients, assess their needs and ask them about any recent interactions with family, friends and neighbors. Without revealing the infected person’s identity, trackers call everyone they may have interacted with and ask them to self-quarantine for 14 days. “We know this is really stressful and onerous to the people we call,” said Dr Mike Reid, an assistant professor in infectious disease at UCSF who is leading the city’s contact tracing efforts. Tracers help connect sick or exposed people to any healthcare services they may need, offer to have the city deliver them food and medicine while they’re in quarantine, and offer them a hotel room if they are unhoused or unable to isolate from family members at home. Right now, the city has the capacity to offer tests to everyone with symptoms, Reid said – but ideally, medical centers will also be able to test everyone who may have been exposed to the virus, regardless of whether they look sick. “Look, we’re just getting started here. This is early, early days,” Reid said. “But the idea is we’ll slowly build up our capacity to trace and test so that we’re prepared for when everything opens back up.” With stringent distancing measures in place, the job has been relatively manageable, Reid said. The average San Franciscan has only three or four contacts – and they’re usually family members. But once bars, restaurants and other workplaces reopen, contact tracing will be essential to quickly catch and contain new outbreaks. Testing will also have to be scaled up. To do so effectively, California will have to meaningfully address inequalities that have baked into society long before the pandemic hit, reaching unhoused and undocumented people who are most vulnerable to illness, and least able to access health services. The state has a shaky record, failing to protect unhoused and incarcerated populations throughout the pandemic. “The systematic biases in our society leave Latino workers most vulnerable to the coronavirus,” said David Hayes-Bautista, a professor of public health and medicine at UCLA. “And these are the people who are going to be hardest to contact trace.” Immigrant communities are justifiably worried that each time they share information about their status and location, “it will come back to haunt them,” Hayes-Bautista said. “It makes sense that people are scared.” Local governments can make sure people feel safe and protected by deputizing local non-profits and indigenous and immigrant rights advocacy groups to help in the tracing efforts, he said. In rural Madera county, where the local officials have deputized sheriffs in plainclothes to contact trace from the very beginning of the outbreak in early March, officials have taken care to avoid asking anyone about their immigration status and reassuring residents that their health information will remain confidential, said Sara Bosse, the county’s public health director. In the farming community, where more than 50% of residents identify as Hispanic or Latino, the city has also partnered with community health organizations to reach unhoused and other vulnerable populations. San Francisco has similarly publicized that the contact tracing is “voluntary, confidential, and culturally and linguistically appropriate. Immigration status will have no bearing on these conversations.” Nationally, the US still has a long way to go before contact tracing can become a reliable part of the strategy to reopen. “The existing public health system is currently capable of providing only a fraction of the contact tracing and voluntary self-isolation capacity required to meet the Covid-19 challenge,” a prominent group of public health officials wrote Monday in letter to House and Senate leaders, noting that lawmakers would need to allocate an additional $46bn to tracing and isolation efforts. Nationally, at least 100,000 contact tracers will be needed to see after Americans who have fallen ill, or have been exposed, according to the National Association of County and City Health Officials. Others estimate that a workforce of 180,000 to 300,000 will be required. Dr Joia Mukherjee, the chief medical officer at Partners in Health in Massachusetts, who is leading the nation’s first statewide contact tracing effort there, said she’s found that calling and educating everyone who may have been exposed to the coronavirus is especially important right now, in the US. Mukherjee, who has worked to fight outbreaks and pandemics around the world, pointed at anti-lockdown protests and misinformation swirling online. “Proven scientific fact about an infectious disease was completely shunned and mocked by the president,” she said. “So we need to make sure people have the information they need to stay safe.”
243	The lime green leaf buds are everywhere. I’m cycling in the sunshine with my legs bared (both for the first time this year) on a wide street normally made narrow by traffic. There are pale pinks and brighter pinks, and the birdsong is loud and constant. And then, at the intersection, I hear a siren – it’s farther down the street, but it’s coming fast. And then another one, trying to get someone from danger, or else get them to safety. I remember that this isn’t exactly New York. It’s purgatory. Some of us are balanced between the possibility of heaven (less pollution, less commuting, more sleep) and the possibility of hell (job loss, sickness, death). Some of us have already been pushed by Covid-19 into experiencing the latter. Sitting on the fulcrum of this strange seesaw, I see my privilege. A one-bedroom apartment all to myself. A small kingdom to tidy and bleach every day. No one to fight with about whether or not to wash the vegetables. No one sitting on the toilet when you need to use the shower. But having no one to cook for also means having no one to share your food with. I haven’t hugged anyone for 50 days. Without the smell of someone else, without the sounds of their footsteps, their typing, their snoring (they always swear they never snore, even though I’m the only conscious witness), I’ve noticed that my other senses have become heightened. The yellow of the lemons feels flamboyant, the satin of these petals on the pad of my thumb. I notice the ache of my limbs that don’t move as far as they want each day. For the first time in a long time, I’m taking note. I draw every day. I think that if I can keep on working, I can stay where I am in the balance, that I won’t slip with the less fortunate into sickness and neither will my loved ones. Of course, that’s a delusion but those are easier to maintain when you live by yourself.
244	People keep saying it: everything has changed. As the days spent in our homes blur together and become indistinguishable, outside in the world huge shifts in consciousness are happening. Just as it was unimaginable that things could go back to normal after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US, so it is that policy, investments and our collective imaginations over the coming years will be overshadowed by a virus that took fewer than 100 days to shut the world down. These strange months may be the first of an era defined by hyper-awareness of the threat posed by pandemics. It is too soon to say what that will look like. Each day brings shocks and possibilities, illuminates a little more of our new reality. Epidemiologists will study the past five months for decades; historians even longer. But already we can see the rough contours forming. We are learning what works against Covid-19. And, surveying the wreckage of the third coronavirus to become an epidemic this century – along with two animal influenzas and several waves of Ebola – lessons are emerging about the kinds of societies that will be required to withstand the future outbreaks that scientists tell us are inevitable, and increasing. * * * You must move fast China announced the discovery of a “pneumonia of unknown origin” on the afternoon of 31 December. The announcement barely registered in a world preparing to celebrate the end of the decade. But that same day in Taiwan, the government in Taipei ordered any planes arriving from Wuhan to remain on the tarmac so airport staff could inspect the health of all those onboard. China resisted implementing country-wide health screenings or taking temperature readings in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, for the next fortnight, even as doctors in the city were reporting floods of patients struggling to breathe, and as leaders in Beijing became aware they were confronting “the most severe challenge” since Sars. In the meantime, Taiwan’s Centers for Disease Control was monitoring arrivals from Wuhan, quarantining any person with a fever or cough and urging its citizens to avoid any unnecessary travel to Hubei. A study released in March underlined the importance of acting fast. Had China implemented widespread testing, a cordon sanitaire around Hubei and other measures a week earlier, it would have reduced China’s caseload by 66%, the researchers argued. Acting three weeks earlier would have cut cases by 95%. As of this week, Taiwan has confirmed 429 positive coronavirus cases and six deaths. The lesson for governments was underlined by Michael Ryan, a surgeon and the executive director of the World Health Organization’s health emergencies programme, in a press conference in March. “Be fast. Have no regrets. You must be the first mover. The virus will always get you if you don’t move quickly,” he said. “If you need to be right before you move, you will never win … Speed trumps perfection.” * * * We know what works to contain it … Months into this epidemic, even basic information about the coronavirus is still unclear. How infectious is it? How deadly? Leaders make life-and-death decisions based on best guesses. “We are flying the plane as it’s being built,” says Ashley Arabasadi, a policy adviser at the US-based institute Management Sciences for Health. Yet the basic principles for containing a disease, developed and refined with reference to hundreds of previous epidemics, have held true for Covid-19. “The successful examples and failed examples in containing the spread of the virus have something in common,” says Yanzhong Huang, the director of the Centre for Global Health Studies at Seton Hall University in the US. The countries that have implemented early and extensive testing, such as South Korea and Iceland, have been able to keep their societies relatively open, without loosing the virus into their populations. Singapore kept a lid on its initial wave by diligently retracing the steps of people who tested positive for Covid-19. Those they came into sustained contact with were often put in home isolation, with harsh penalties for breaking it. The sick were quarantined in hospitals, even if their symptoms were mild. When containing cases is no longer possible, early evidence from Europe shows that physical distancing measures, implemented early, “flatten the curve” and reduce the overall size of a country’s outbreak. “Irrespective of the society, the level of development, the preparedness of the health system, early lockdown worked in containing the epidemic, whereas a late lockdown led to a massive outbreak,” says Joel Ruet, the president of the Bridge Tank thinktank, which conducted the research. … the hard part is implementing it In 2014, as Ebola was spreading in west Africa, Rebecca Katz remembers hearing frustrations from some of the countries helping to fund the response. “They would be asking things like: ‘How dare Sierra Leone not close schools during an Ebola outbreak?’” says the director of the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University Medical Center. “For a long time it’s been easy for donor countries to cast judgment on recipient countries for their behaviour in disease transmission.” The coronavirus outbreak has made clear that it is a universal problem: even countries that know what works, and have the capacity to act, still hesitate. Some with strong liberal traditions, such as Britain, balked initially at the prospect of drastically curbing civil rights. Italian industry groups are reported to have strongly resisted the idea of shutting down Lombardy, one of the engines of the country’s economy. Developing countries such as Pakistan have had to balance slowing the spread of the disease with the disastrous consequences of closing the farms and construction sites where the poorest work. “It’s really easy for me to say, hey, we should institute social distancing measures and close schools and cut the link between those susceptible to the disease and the infectious,” says Katz. “Knowing what the larger societal impact is makes it harder to pull the trigger.” There were blind spots in the way countries prepared. A global index released in October concluded the US was more ready than anywhere else to fight a pandemic. But the scorecard, based on WHO methodology, focused more on technical capacity than government processes, says Alexandra Phelan, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center. Official figures show the US has had the largest and most deadly outbreak, exacerbated by a slow initial response, mismanagement of testing and poor coordination between states and the federal government. “As this outbreak has demonstrated, you can have the best labs in the world, the best notification systems and software, but if you don’t have the appropriate governance of when to use these powers … they don’t function,” Phelan says. * * * Civil liberties face their greatest test in a generation Digital surveillance tools that might have been closely scrutinised in normal times have been urgently rolled out over recent weeks. More than 40 countries have implemented some form of surveillance or censorship in the name of fighting the coronavirus, according to one estimate. These tools have created a world that might have appeared dystopian a few months ago. In Hong Kong and Bahrain, people in quarantine are being issued with electronic bracelets that track their movements. Drones equipped with cameras hover over some Indian neighbourhoods warning residents they are being watched. Israel has revealed it has secretly been amassing people’s phone data and is tapping that database to find potential coronavirus cases. South Korea credited its advanced use of technology with helping to uncover clusters of cases that would otherwise have gone undetected. About 81% of Koreans approve of the surveillance measures there, according to one poll. Human rights advocates acknowledge we are living through an emergency, but worry governments will use fears of future outbreaks to justify keeping many of these tools in place – whether or not they help. “We are facing an immense challenge, but necessity is the question,” says Akshaya Kumar, the director of crisis advocacy at Human Rights Watch. “Some of these measures are just peering into people’s lives and taking power without a clear sunset clause, and without a sense that they’re really needed to combat the virus.” “The potential for abuse is high,” the UN warned in a report last week. “What is justified during an emergency now may become normalised once the crisis has passed.” * * * Public trust is a government’s most valuable asset. The next months will strain it There is no precedent for half the world’s population living under some kind of lockdown. It might just be the single largest collective act undertaken by humanity. Its successful execution requires extraordinary public trust in their governments, says Lars Trägårdh, a Swedish historian who studies trust in institutions over time. “If you trust the government is working for your good, and you trust other citizens to follow the rules, you have huge advantages for collective action,” he says. In places where trust in government is weak, fear has worked to clear the streets. In South Africa, police used whips to enforce a national curfew. Indian migrant labourers walking home were made to squat and crawl as punishment for being outside, while in Jordan, more than 1,600 people were imprisoned in the first three days of quarantine. But restrictions implemented in low-trust societies could engender a backlash, says Trägårdh. “And that’s what happening in Southern Europe and the US right now where you see a lot of disobedience.” Over the next months, governments are going to allow people to resume their lives amid the worst economic conditions since the Great Depression. Should new waves of the virus be detected, states may again ask their citizens to return home. Managing this is going to require significant stores of public trust, that in some places are quickly eroding. “If people agree to do something in the long term, without a threat hanging over their heads, they are more likely to keep doing it,” Trägårdh says. “The alternative is fear, distrust, and chaos, and that isn’t good, no matter what the policy might be.” * * * Leaders who deny science are a liability Many leaders have enjoyed what may be a temporary surge in popularity as frightened citizens rally around them in a crisis. Two notable exceptions have been the US president, Donald Trump, and his Brazilian counterpart, Jair Bolsonaro, whose ratings have declined sharply. Both men, rightwing populists who frame their presidencies as revolts against the elites, including scientific authorities, have been highly skilled at influencing the media environment. But the coronavirus is a unique test. It spreads and kills regardless of how it is being framed online or in the media. It emphasises the importance of experts. Success depends on rallying the country together. “Leaders such as Trump deploy simple messages: insider versus outsider, us versus them,” says Sanjoy Chakravorty, a professor at Temple University in the US, who studies the politics of information. “And they are having an ideological crisis in how to manage the message here. This is a very complicated information sphere, which you can’t put into ‘us and them’ boxes … because in this case everybody is the ‘us’.” Rather than rewarding bravado, the moment appears to favour leaders who can be honest about the uncertainty inherent in fighting a virus, says Kathleen Bachynski, an assistant professor of public health at Muhlenberg College. “If leaders are not willing or able to be honest about these limitations, there will be this loss of credibility – and it won’t be because they are wrong, it’s because information is changing.” Those overseeing some of the more successful responses, such as Germany’s Angela Merkel or Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand, have been praised for their ability to project empathy and communicate complex ideas. Asked to explain Germany’s metrics for deciding when to ease the lockdown, Merkel fluently explained the need to bring down the “reproducibility number” of the virus so that the health system can cope with its continued spread. In a press conference a few days earlier, Trump answered the same question by pointing to his head. “The metrics right here,” he said. “That’s my metrics.” The responses to the virus in both Brazil and the US are increasingly being led by state leaders, who are bypassing the federal government and coordinating directly with each other. * * * Self-sufficiency matters again … Governments will not soon forget the desperate global scramble for personal protective equipment and medical supplies they have engaged in these past months. Nor the sight of doctors and nurses forced to guard against infection using bin bags and homemade masks. Several countries have already restricted the exporting of some pharmaceuticals and more than a dozen have imposed bans on selling some food abroad. The UN has warned that if quarantines persist, food supply chains in some places might start to be disrupted from this month. The message is being received. EU countries are emphasising the importance of increasing the “strategic autonomy” of the bloc and ensuring it produces its own essential goods. Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, told village leaders last week the most important lesson from the pandemic was the need for self-reliance. “We should not look to other countries to satisfy our needs,” he said. Australia is one of several countries said to be re-examining the exposure of food, fuel and medical supplies in particular to global supply chains, the fragility of which have been exposed. … but the world cannot beat the virus without cooperating The coronavirus got lucky: it emerged at a low point for global cooperation. Countries recognised after Sars that sharing information, coordinating responses and pooling resources such as protective gear, medicine and tests was vital. A set of international regulations that came into force in 2007 laid the groundwork for this cooperation. As Covid-19 started to spread, the regulations were virtually ignored. “The biggest surprise was how quickly the plans were not at all consulted,” Katz says. “The world was quick to throw out the global governance tools we had so carefully negotiated.” The lack of cooperation has weakened the world’s response, public health experts argue. A global stimulus package might have put a floor under the economic catastrophe unfolding in many countries. Coordinated shutdowns and reopenings would have slowed the spread of the virus and could speed up the recovery. We might have avoided chaos in the global market for medical and protective equipment, with reports of the US waving wads of cash to re-divert planeloads of masks bound for France, and Israel running clandestine spy operations to source testing kits. “The last four years have seen a profound shift to governments that are protectionist and nationalistic and who argue the multilateral system doesn’t benefit them,” Phelan says. “Those of us who work in global health or other international problems know we’re interconnected. That global problems required global solutions.” * * * Austerity and inequality make us less resilient No economy could withstand the shock of a large slice of the workforce suddenly ordered home. But the virus has irradiated weaknesses that have made the outbreak deadlier, and will make its aftermath hurt more. The problems with tying health insurance to employment in the US have become even more obvious: the 26 million Americans who have filed for benefits over the past month did not just lose their jobs, many also lost their medical coverage. Britain has the NHS, but a decade of austerity had weakened the system and left the country in demonstrably worse health when the virus struck. The rise of precarious gig-economy jobs and zero-hours contracts has created a mass of workers without access to sick and paid leave, incentivising some to keep working when the entire community needs them to stay home. Insecure work and barriers to healthcare disproportionately burden people from ethnic minorities and poor people: both are dying from Covid-19 at a higher rate in the US and Britain. Governments that have spent decades scaling back social welfare systems are now scrambling to build new ones on the fly. “The world is realising that there are many millions of workers who have fallen through the cracks of the existing social protection systems,” says Luca Pellerano, a senior social protection specialist with the International Labour Organisation. “They are not in forms of protected employment, yet they are not poor enough to fall into the often quite narrow and shallow [existing] anti-poverty programmes. Countries with very fragile systems, with big coverage gaps, are scrambling to find solutions and are clearly behind the curve.” * * * The poor and migrants cannot be invisible Singapore’s response has been lauded as a model. Its government moved fast, utilising technology, exemplary public communication and the traditional tools of outbreak control to corral its first wave of cases to about 200. Then last week, it announced it had discovered thousands of new infections, almost all of them among migrant workers living in dormitories on industrial estates on the outskirts of the sleek city-state. Rights groups say little attention was paid to the more than 1 million migrant workers, even as restrictions on crowding and movement were rolled out. Viruses can see the people who are usually invisible to policymakers and the public. The conditions in which they work and live are everyone’s problem. The same is true of the residents of Dharavi, a Mumbai slum where almost 1 million people are crammed together within sight of the skyscrapers and penthouses apartments of some of the wealthiest people in Asia. More than 200 cases have been discovered so far. City authorities acknowledge it will be virtually impossible to halt the spread of the disease among these communities. “Ten to 15 people stay in one room,” one official, Kiran Dighavkar, told New Delhi Television last week. “How is it possible to enforce social distancing?”

Part It’s Blitz!-era Yeah Yeah Yeahs, part long-lost Cardigans B-side, their second track of the year is a strawberry-sweet, hazy ode to times gone by. Best enjoyed on your daily state-sanctioned walk beneath the late spring blossom. Jamie xx Idontknow Feels weird for Jamie xx to return after five years with such a heavy dance track – thumping warehouse beats, whistles, cut’n’spliced vocal samples – during a time in which we can’t even go to the shops twice, let alone the club. How are people supposed to enjoy this? While baking their seventh consecutive banana bread? Fingers crossed it makes more sense after lockdown. Bon Iver PDLIF Like him or loathe him, Justin “Bon Iver” Vernon has always been especially good at making music that sounds both mournful and full-hearted. Pairing euphoric, layered vocals with sorrowful piano, PDLIF is a hopeful anthem for frightening times. “There will be a better day / There will be a better day,” he sings alongside Kacy Hill, and you find yourself actually believing them. Arlo Parks Black Dog While Bon Iver urges us to look forward to the good times, Arlo Parks reminds us that it’s OK to feel like shit and wallow instead (“I’d lick the grief right off your lips / You do your eyes like Robert Smith,” croons the 19-year-old). Despite the gloomy subject, Black Dog is a gorgeous, gentle creation, with Parks’s soulful vocals floating above blissful, swirling production. Who knew sadness could sound so sweet?

Oh wait.
253	Millions of households have missed, or expect to miss, payments on at least one bill as a result of the coronavirus crisis, and could face serious consequences as a result, the charity Citizens Advice has said. Since the lockdown started, millions of workers have been furloughed or laid off by employers, and seen their pay fall as a result. Measures have been put in place to allow borrowers payment holidays and stall evictions, but the charity said that after these protections are lifted, millions face a “financial cliff edge”. A survey of 2,016 people carried out for Citizens Advice found a quarter of respondents had missed, or expected to miss, a payment, and 20% had missed payments of rent, council tax or telecoms bills. Arrears in these payments can have the most severe consequences, the charity said, with eviction, bailiff action or disconnection possible. If the results are extrapolated across the rest of the population, Citizens Advice said 11 million people could face problems when protections put in place during the crisis end. Property possessions and face-to-face bailiff recovery have been paused, but these measures are not due to continue beyond June. The survey found that people facing the greatest health risk from coronavirus were three times more likely to have fallen behind on a bill than average, and that the figure was the same among those in insecure work, such as agency workers and those on zero-hours contracts. Those aged under 40 were four times as likely to have missed payments as those over 40. The charity called on the government to fast-track the abolition of no-fault evictions and ensure tenants are given the chance to make up payments that they miss as a result of the crisis. It also wants councils to receive financial support to offer payment holidays to those struggling to meet council tax bills. Lucretia Thomas, a project adviser at Citizens Advice Enfield, said the pandemic had had a “devastating” effect on households, with some facing the threat of eviction from landlords. “Many families that we see are in insecure employment and have lost income during the lockdown,” she said. “They’re telling us that their household expenses have increased as they stay at home to reduce the spread of Covid-19 during this challenging time and beyond.” Dame Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said government measures had eased the financial burden for many households, “but millions still have reason to fear the looming financial cliff edge when these protections end”. She added: “The government must take strong action to prevent millions going over the financial cliff edge, ensure people are helped out of debt, and so support the economic recovery.”
254	Flash back to the summer of 2007: Spider-Man 3 was in theatres. Two of the top five most viewed YouTube videos were by the band My Chemical Romance. And The Notebook, a movie starring Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling as star-crossed teenage lovers who reconnect as adults, was three years old. The famous re-enactment of the film’s climactic lift-and-kiss at the MTV movie awards by its stars, then a real-life couple, was two years old. I was 13 years old and, true to sheltered oldest child form, didn’t know about any of this. And so one sleepover night in my friend’s basement, I faced at least three aghast faces: “You haven’t seen The Notebook?!?” The Notebook probably has fans outside my demographic – it’s an adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks romance novel, a book/author/genre marketed to middle-aged women – but for girls in middle school (or, at least, my middle school in suburban Ohio) between 2004 and 2008 or so, it was a foundational text. It was the romantic movie of choice, a portal into couple-shipping YouTube and, later, Tumblr holes, a benchmark for years of unrealistic dating expectations. You wanted to know what sex was “supposed” to look and sound like AND tell everyone you bawled at the profound idea of love transcending old age? You watched The Notebook. For those who haven’t seen it, The Notebook follows 17-year-old Allie (McAdams) as she moves to a small South Carolina town for the summer and meets Noah (Gosling), a construction worker fond of Walt Whitman and bold gestures, such as threatening to jump off a ferris wheel to get Allie to go out with him. They fall in love, then break up (she’s rich, he’s not; her parents disapprove) and, separately, serve in the second world war . He pines for her; she gets engaged to handsome, preternaturally forgiving solider played by James Marsden. They reconnect, and things are complicated. The story is narrated by the older Noah, who reads from a notebook composed by Allie as a totem to bring her back from the dementia eclipsing her memories. This twist – Noah and Allie have together composed an epic love story that she mostly can’t remember – landed like a gut punch for us as emotionally chaotic seventh-graders who had imagined our sunset years approximately zero times. All of us watching that summer night ended the movie in tears, which was a cathartic bonding experience on its own. But at 13, on the cusp of high school but seemingly, for me, light-years away from sneaking out with a boy, the main draw was the heat between McAdams and Gosling. Their chemistry was palpable and hungry with a sharp, heady sting. (It is transparent they were falling in love off-screen.) These two were brain-meltingly hot, an unknowing factory of aspirational summer love gifs. Importantly for me then, the film hinges on one pivotal, rain-soaked scene in which Allie asks Noah why he never wrote her when they broke up. (Actually, he wrote her 365 letters! He wrote her every day for a year!). He proclaims, famously: “It wasn’t over … it STILL isn’t over.” At the time, I had no older friends or siblings, no health class, just the steamy handprint from Titanic, so I was thrilled when they kiss, and he pushes her against a wall, and carries her up the stairs, and strips off her soaked clothes … and the camera keeps rolling. As far as movies go, The Notebook has a rather tame sex scene – all soft lighting, swelling music, delicate shots that don’t reveal much, nudity-wise. The camera mostly lingers on McAdams’ face as she has a transcendent time (again, disappointingly high expectations were set by this movie). The whole scene is only about 4.5 minutes long, but at 13 this felt like an eternity, and a guidebook. Oh, adulthood has this? You lose your senses and can’t take your hands off someone? Good to know! Rewatching The Notebook for the first time in years, it’s clear, of course, how silly it was to base my idea of maturity on this movie, and also how stellar McAdams and Gosling’s performances remain. The Notebook could have been a solid B-movie romance (see: every other Nicholas Sparks adaptation), but the lead performances power it far higher than its melodramatic parts. It is almost thrilling – and the main draw for me now – to watch two ascendant, now-acclaimed actors make the hairpin turns of its dialogue somewhat convincing. The idea of actually fighting this way? Laughable. But that look Noah gives Allie when he asks: “Goddammit, what do you WANT?” Yeah, that still hits. A couple of weeks ago, before this series assignment, I rewatched The Notebook on instinct. It felt good during, you know, ALL THIS, to return to an old favourite, to slip along the slick grooves of worn emotions. To retrace the lines of this familiar ride, even if I now find many of them horribly cheesy, and my feelings cringingly earnest. How to think of it now? I defer to Gosling, who said in that fateful year, 2007: “God bless The Notebook. It introduced me to one of the great loves of my life.” I would not classify The Notebook as one of my great loves, but still: god bless this movie, flawed textbook that it was, for introducing me to a new vision of the adult future, and for saying: Hang on. It’s a bumpy ride of feelings ahead but one day, you’ll appreciate them.
255	My girlfriend Romy and I are both from Bristol, but in 2016 were living apart. I was in London working as an accountant and she was teaching in Paris. We decided we wanted more time together and an adventure. We packed up our lives and moved to Queenstown, New Zealand. Our time there was amazing: we worked in the day and spent evenings waterskiing, mountain running or barbecuing on the beach. At weekends, we’d explore the South Island, but to do it properly you need a legendary vehicle, something that will just keep going. I found a knackered Toyota Land Cruiser for sale online. When we went to take a look, it turned out to be a neglected prison vehicle with a bird living inside, but it was only £6,000. We spent 18 months repairing it. Then every weekend we’d chuck a mattress in the back and head off on escapades. After a few years, we decided to return to the UK and start building a more dependable life together. When it came time to say goodbye to New Zealand, we couldn’t leave the car behind. We researched the 25,000-mile drive from New Zealand to Bristol in depth. It would take 10 months and no one would insure us. But when our families said, “You can’t,” we thought, “Why not?” We set off on 16 February 2019 with a mattress, gas cooker, barbecue, two camping chairs, some clothes, a surfboard and a £50 daily budget for fuel and food. After a month on New Zealand’s North Island, we shipped the car to Malaysia and met it in Kuala Lumpur. From there, we drove across 22 countries: Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Iran, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Albania, Montenegro, by ferry to Italy, Austria, Germany, Luxembourg, Belgium, France and Britain. As for the highlights – it’s hard to skip any part. Pakistan’s Passu Cones mountains in late summer provided the best view: I’ve never seen mountains so high. And the two-week drive through northernmost India’s Himalayas, from Manali to Leh, was among the best stretches of road. The locals were friendliest in Pakistan. We were invited to a stranger’s 40th birthday and given the first slice of cake. We’re still in touch over Facebook. Laos, with its limited tourist infrastructure, was the most rewarding adventure with great food. We’d have khao soy (noodle soup) for breakfast with a bucket of fresh juice. In Thailand, we’d wake up with nothing between us and the sea but sand. Crossing the Pakistan-Iran border was the only hairy moment. Tourists are given an armed escort but, as we passed through a military base on the way to the border, the guards were tense and warned that the Taliban were in the area. We passed them several times as our escort yelled at me to keep driving. It was a terrifying half-hour before they dropped us off, but it’s the kind of experience that locals have daily. I serviced the car in most countries, every 3,000 miles. Those were some of my favourite moments. I’d borrow space in a local garage and hang with the mechanics for an hour, chatting using hand gestures. When we arrived in Britain on 11 December, I cried. The light on Dover’s cliffs was beautiful. I hadn’t seen family for two years. Our friends threw a party at the pub, and I proposed to Romy. Living out of a car together for 10 months felt like a bigger commitment than marriage – and we hadn’t argued once. She said yes. We loved how spontaneous our trip was: we would start each day not knowing where we’d end up; pulling up at the first traffic lights, something or someone would set our whole day in motion. That can’t last for ever. We’re 30 and have been craving roots. We moved to Edinburgh in February. I’m working as an accountant again and Romy’s a social worker, but there’s unlimited potential for exploring here, hopefully with little ones one day. I love seeing the car parked on the driveway, knowing all the cool places it has been. I’m proud of it. Sometimes I’ll give it a kiss. I hope the three of us (me, Romy and the Land Cruiser) can still be together in our 70s, starting journeys together . • As told to Deborah Linton Do you have an experience to share?

256	A woman sits on a bench by the Thames. Two policemen arrive and tell her to stand up. Two boys remove their shirts in Holland Park. They are told to put them back on. A policeman shouts at two girls in bikinis on Primrose Hill to get dressed. How dare they enjoy themselves. You can crowd a London Tube train but not climb a Welsh mountain. You can drive to a country footpath, but only if the walk takes longer than the drive. Michael Gove will allow you out “just for an hour”. The trouble with official curbs on personal freedoms is that they degenerate into idiot authoritarianism. Rules become ever more pernickety, because their enforcers regard mere enjoyment as abuse. Gove’s directorate is like The Handmaid’s Tale, if not Oliver Cromwell. The latter’s blue laws similarly told women how to dress, and banned walks, pubs, plays, sports and the celebration of festivals. To unbridled power, the only lawful activity is one “necessary” to the security of the state. Is pleasure really unnecessary and happiness a menace? This week’s superb BBC Four documentary on Oxford’s Young Rembrandt exhibition, narrated off-screen by Simon Schama, left me delighted but baffled. Why can I crowd Oxford’s supermarkets but not its Ashmolean Museum? Why are people trusted to “socially distance” in a DIY shop but not in a garden centre or a National Trust park? My local hardware store can sell from its front door, but not my local pub. Only time will tell whose model of coronavirus was correct, and which government’s means of combating it was most effective. Out of a sort of desperation, we have all become statistical nerds, and we strive to be objective. I remain on the side of the Swedes Johan Giesecke and Anders Tegnell (and Boris Johnson mark one), and against Britain’s Neil Ferguson (and Johnson mark two). The former seem to reflect common sense and behavioural science, the latter mathematical dogma and worst-case scenarios. Sweden’s deaths per million, at 244, are currently well behind Britain’s, at 384. I am equally drawn to the Oxford geographer Danny Dorling’s intriguing research suggesting that coronavirus not only peaked in mid-April but appears to follow a similar trajectory everywhere, seemingly regardless of local policy and probably with similar fatality rates. The big difference will be in the collateral damage of their various forms of lockdown. As the Swedish scientists point out, this is a peculiar virus in that its overwhelming – though not most publicised – impact is in exacerbating existing illnesses in old people. This is 80-90% of deaths. Many are already “locked down” in care homes and hospitals. It would therefore make sense to direct all energy at protecting and trying to cure them. Yet while Britain was playing at The Handmaid’s Tale, it was leaving care homes to look after themselves, to an appalling extent in those known to me. For most other people – children, young people, even the middle aged – the risk of fatality, though tragic, is statistically minimal. Countries that have trusted people to observe voluntary distancing have not seen radically different fatalities from countries that have been draconian. Sweden’s victims have been overwhelmingly in already locked-down care homes, not in the general population. The same has been true in voluntarist Germany. I can accept that, with an unknown and lethal disease, some application of the precautionary principle should apply. But even then, it would make sense to relate lockdown to relative risk, if only to minimise harm to the nation’s wider, non-Covid-19-related, physical and mental health. One-size-fits-all lockdown abuses any concept of priority. Hence 18,000 possible extra cancer deaths are now predicted. Britain’s failure – unique in Europe - to involve its local government in lockdown decisions or remedial measures has clearly been a serious error. It delayed action on protective equipment, as well as on testing and chasing. To have to call in the army rather than use local councils and officials was crass. It will clearly impede the local easing of lockdown. I have still seen no good argument for keeping schools closed, just mindless Downing Street dogma. One size never fits all. Just as Covid-19 is selective, so surely can be the escape from it. The risk of infection is known to be greater in cities than elsewhere. So liberate the counties and countryside. The risk is greater indoors, so liberate outdoor trading. The risk is greater to the vulnerable old, so stop stifling the social and economic activities of the young. If you liberate high-risk Tube trains and supermarkets, why not low-risk playgrounds, public footpaths, pub gardens and local churches? If there really is a second peak – and there is always a risk – then we should be like Germany, and face it when it occurs. Meanwhile there is no question of a risk to lives and livelihoods in prolonging lockdown: that is a certainty. Britain has not been exceptional in much, except in its refusal to inform and debate with the public over lockdown. It has behaved like an old-fashioned centralist bureaucracy, with ministers and officials mouthing slogans and giving orders. What is the matter with the government? Why can’t we sit on a bench? • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist
257	Blister in the sun … In this image from Jan Jedlička’s new photobook 200m, sunshades and loungers become sentinels on the sands. The closed canvas umbrellas recall the silhouettes of standing stones erected by prehistoric sun worshippers. Yet, while they seem to march on for ever towards the horizon line, they are plainly the opposite of millennia-old monuments, built to survive little more than the rough and tumble of a summer holiday. It is unclear if this is the beginning of a day of sunbathing crowds, or the end of the season. Shifting sands … Indeed, while they were created between 2008 and 2015, it is hard not to view the Czech landscape photographer’s shots of vast expanses of depopulated beach, a lonely basketball court or an empty car park through a coronavirus lens. The lonely sea … This is Principina a Mare, an idyllic seaside resort by the unspoilt Maremma Natural Park in Tuscany. The area is usually a low-key but chichi getaway for wealthy sun-seekers, but this year will presumably be as empty as it is in Jedlička’s series. Here today … Spend some time with his vision of the near-deserted Tuscan beach and its surroundings, though, and the effect is less calamitous than bittersweet. A tangle of footprints in the sand or a child’s bucket abandoned at the water’s edge are testament to fleeting good times in the face of natural cycles of constant change. Square root … Even the method used by the photographer suggests the shortfall between human order and the unruly elements. While each image is created according to specific rules – square, black-and-white and taken with a range of no more than 200m – the variety they capture is infinite. Jan Jedlička’s 200m is published by Steidl
258	I test sex toys for a living, so I thought I knew a lot about the female orgasm. Then I discovered “sexual transmutation” – the idea that you can harness your sexual energy to achieve goals. The practice is nothing new – it exists in Tantric and Taoist traditions. But I set about developing my own “masturbation for manifestation” method. My system combines the law of attraction (the belief that we attract into our lives whatever we focus on) with visualisation techniques and my own orgasmic energy. I set an intention, then stimulate myself sexually while I use my imagination to eroticise my aim. For instance, to manifest a new home, I might imagine myself inside it: my bare feet against the floor, naked on the new sofa and something erotic happening there. When I reach orgasm, the energy is released into the universe, where it begins to attract the ideal place. Some desires are easier to eroticise than others. Getting aroused while I thought about loan repayments was a challenge, but last summer I managed to become debt-free. I find masturbation with intention also takes a lot longer than when I was focused just on pleasure. This is a practice I reserve only for masturbation: when I’m having sex with someone, I’m focused on sharing an intimate moment. Thanks to my technique, I have manifested some incredible things, such as professional opportunities, holidays, even love. I hardly recognise my life now. It doesn’t always work, but at least I enjoy the process. • Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life. Want to share yours? Email sex@theguardian.com.

259	The book I am currently reading The Discomfort of Evening by Marieke Lucas Rijneveld. A young Dutch author perfectly delineates the life of a farm community in all its strange variations. The book that changed my life James Joyce’s Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. The setting was fairly familiar but the thrall of the language and the intensity of feeling gave a whole new meaning to life and introduced me to the alchemy and mystery of creativity. The book I wish I’d written Any story by Anton Chekhov. The first Chekhov story I ever read was ‘The Steppe’. Books we most need come to us in a time of extremity. I read several pages of it in a cornfield in Ireland. My two sons were frisking about, my husband was silent and we had stopped to have tea from a flask, having just had a bitter parting from my family. I was on the point of leaving my husband but feared I would not have the courage or the means. Chekhov’s story was that of a young boy being brought to a distant part of Russia to boarding school and though he was missing his mother, he was also observing everything around him and listening to the merchants’ droll conversations. He submerged his grief in the wonders all about him. What was uncanny for me was how convincing and immediate the story felt. I still have that edition with an inscription I wrote on the flyleaf, “This story redeemed my sanity.” It was dated September 1962. The book that influenced me A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway. He is a master of compression. The book I think is most underrated The works of Rachel Carson. A marine biologist, she went to the depths of the ocean and foresaw the ruin mankind was, and is, bringing to the environment. The Sea Around Us and Silent Spring are masterpieces. The book that changed my mind On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin. It dislodged much of my religious education. The book that made me cry Many books make me cry, but when I read Nadezhda Mandelstam’s Hope Against Hope I cried that both she and her husband – the poet Osip – had suffered interrogation then been exiled to Siberia for no more reason than that he was a great poet and she was his ally. The book that made me laugh The Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens. The folly and scheming of those four gallants was a long way from Heathcliff but they captivated and charmed me, partly because they were such bunglers and because of how Dickens loved them and explored every corner of human fallibility. The book I’m ashamed not to have read Don Quixote by Cervantes. My earliest reading memory The prayer books in our house, which included some of the most succinct and beautifully written parables of the gospels. My comfort read I do not read for comfort. I read to be quickened, enlightened and brought to the frontiers of feeling. The book I give as a gift The Leopard by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa. It’s glorious. • Girl by Edna O’Brien is published by Faber (RRP £16.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.
260	Thousands of Americans plan to take part in a rent strike on Friday, calling for state leaders to cancel rent during the coronavirus crisis. Activists in New York, Pennsylvania and California are encouraging tenants to withhold rent, whether they are able to pay or not, to draw attention to the plight of those unable to pay. The protest is expected to represent the largest coordinated rent strike in America in decades, and comes as the labor department announced another 3.8 million people lost their jobs last week, with pressure growing on state leaders nationwide to increase their efforts on housing. More than 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits in the past six weeks, as the coronavirus has caused widespread business closures. The New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is among those voicing support for the strikes, which are being coordinated by an array of housing groups. “People aren’t striking because they don’t feel like paying rent, they’re striking because they can’t,” Ocasio-Cortez said. In New York, more than 12,000 people have pledged to not pay their rent, and progressive state lawmakers have proposed legislation that would suspend or cancel rent payments for tenants who lost income due to the coronavirus. In March, New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, suspended evictions for 90 days, in a move that prevents landlords from ousting tenants who cannot pay their rent. But critics say that merely postpones the problem. “We need a suspension of rent and automatic forgiveness of any rent, mortgage or utility payment owed or accumulated during the length of this crisis,” said Housing Justice for All, which campaigns to increase tenants’ rights and to end homelessness in New York. Like Cuomo, Governor Gavin Newsom of California has barred evictions due to coronavirus hardship – tenants must provide proof their income has been affected by the pandemic – but stopped short of waiving individuals’ rent payments. About 8,000 members of the Los Angeles Tenants Union are expected to withhold rent as of 1 May, while a similar movement is taking place in Philadelphia. If the estimates of New York City organizers prove accurate, the rent strike would be the largest there since the 1930s, when tenants in Harlem and the Lower East Side demanded lower rent. In Harlem, the protesters were predominantly African Americans, who protested against being charged higher rent than white tenants.
261	Ten years ago I did three months of self-isolation. I wasn’t well, had had a terrible breakdown and could barely leave the house. Company was overwhelming, work impossible. So I sat and figured out a new way to live. The episode was excruciating, but much good came out of it. Crisis is opportunity. We learn from mistakes. Failure enables us to succeed better. All the old cliches, of course, but the reason cliches are cliches is that they are often true. I was able to gradually restore bits of my life and see if they were good for me. Work, yes. Overtime, no. Family, yes. Friendships, yes. Worrying, no. FOMO, no. Duty, no. Shoulds, no. This is the opportunity we have now, individually and collectively. It’s a huge chance to do some things better, to start anew. If this period has taught us anything, it’s that life is short, too short to fritter away at someone else’s behest, but just about long enough if you can find out what makes you tick and stick to it. Many of you appear to agree. Last week we asked you: what will you take from lockdown into your new life? A selection of answers are below in the “what we heard” section. They are well worth reading. But before that, herewith the usual eclectic mix of viral and non-viral Upsiders from the past week: New Zealand’s light at the end of the tunnel. Lithuania’s plan for a great summer outdoors. Concrete hopes for a Covid treatment. The carers who moved into their care home to save the residents. And take a look at our series Hope in a Time of Crisis. Away from the pandemic this week: The suburb that gave citizenship to its bees. How to avoid using Amazon. Turning fishing net jetsam into hats, chairs, even bikes. Totally random, gratuitous quiz of the week. (Can you beat 8 out of 20?) Lucky numbers More good news on the environmental front, with a record-breaking coal-less run in UK power generation. Good news for your pension, too: Covid may have obliterated stock markets in March but they bounced back in April. What we liked We salute efforts by our cousins at PositiveNews to crowdfund the distribution of their feel-good mag to healthcare workers across Britain. We love the notion of “suspended shopping” in Italy, a variation on the “pay it forward” idea, reported here by NPR. And CSM had a decent piece about the prospects of Covid-19 bringing about rapprochement in the Middle East. What we heard We had a full mailbag this week after we solicited ideas for what to take forward with us out of lockdown. Jane Currie was philosophical What I want to retain from lockdown is this sense that every breath is precious, that every breath of our children is precious, ditto our friends and everyone who is vulnerable. Jonathan Bennett wrote a long screed from Virginia. The gist was in his final paragraph: Look at the abundance you have and [if] you have some extra, give to someone who doesn’t. Learn to cherish what you do have, not whine about what you don’t, because, I promise, there are tens of millions out there who would kill for a tenth of what you have. Be grateful. Some people right now can’t even afford to do that. Paul Kirkley mused on what travel might look like post-lockdown: Flying should be made VERY MUCH more expensive, so that it starts to reflect the true cost to the environment, and cuts the amount of flying to the bare essential, in order to achieve a severe reduction in carbon emissions. The budget airlines are quite correct in saying that keeping middle seats empty will have no realistic effect on social distancing: IT WON’T. And quite correct in saying that it will make their business model impossible: GOOD. And quite correct in saying that it would make flying much more expensive: IT SHOULD. Sarah Chalmers has been out and about in the wilds around Harrogate: I have learnt that the Nidd Gorge, which is half a mile from my house and where I run each day, is a beautiful, tranquil place teeming with birds and wildlife and, as I now have the time to see, ever changing day on day. I take a photo or video the sounds every day and will continue to do so throughout the year and after lockdown so I have a record to remind me of what is on my doorstep. Chris is using the period of illness to become healthier: I knew that my daily two-mile brisk walk was helping to keep my type 2 diabetes under reasonable control. With the lockdown, instead of the walk I resurrected my exercise bicycle in the kitchen. Doing a total of eight miles after meals has dramatically reduced the post-prandial glucose spikes, measured by my 14-day flash glucose monitor. If the predicted Hba1c score is confirmed by my six-monthly blood test, the doctor will probably want to reduce my medication. My blood pressure has also improved. And finally, do laugh along with the Reijans family and their domestic Olympics, which include toilet roll jenga, pot lid table tennis, and who can put on the most T-shirts in a minute. (Editor’s note: all toilet rolls were responsibly sourced.) Where was the Upside? We love this idea: a scheme enabling people to support the local businesses they love. Local Support Vouchers aims to help independent cafes, restaurants and shops across the UK stay afloat during the pandemic by letting people buy vouchers ready to use when they reopen. What are your lockdown learnings – and what will you take with you into the brave new world? Let us know. And have a good weekend.
262	A viral disease that causes honey bees to suffer severe trembling, flightlessness and death within a week is spreading exponentially in Britain. Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) was only recorded in Lincolnshire in 2007. A decade later, it was found in 39 of 47 English counties and six of eight Welsh counties, according to data collected from visits to more than 24,000 beekeepers. As well as struggling to fly, the afflicted bees develop shiny, hairless abdomens. Piles of dead individuals are found outside hives with whole colonies frequently wiped out by the disease. A team of scientists led by Prof Giles Budge of Newcastle University identified clusterings of the disease, with cases concentrated among apiaries run by professional beekeepers rather than amateur keepers. In the study, published in Nature Communications, scientists used data from 130,000 honey bee imports from 25 countries to show for the first time that the disease was nearly twice as likely in apiaries owned by beekeepers who imported honey bees. Professional beekeepers bring in honey bee queens to replenish their hives every few years. Another way in which commercial beekeeping could be contributing to the spread of the disease is because they tend to manage large colonies, and the virus appears to be rapidly transmitted in densely populated hives. But Budge said it was not clear that the disease was imported via queens and it was “unfair” to claim the disease was caused by industrial beekeeping. “The bee farmers of this country tend to be quite small-scale. A standard bee farmer might have 100 to 200 colonies. In the States, they have up to 10,000. Even in Germany there will be huge-scale beekeeping going on,” he said. According to Budge, professional beekeepers may run into problems in Britain because they are very successful at bringing bees through the winter and building up colonies in spring to take advantage of early flowers such as oilseed rape. If the weather then turns wet, these large colonies are then confined to a hive. “You can’t do social distancing in a hive as easily but you can manage it by increasing the space in there,” said Budge. The viral disease has been around for centuries – its symptoms were first described by Aristotle – but researchers are keen to discover if a new, more virulent strain is behind its global surge. In the United States, CBPV prevalence was 0.7% in 2010 but reached 16% in 2014. Prevalence doubled in Italy from 5% to 10% between 2009 and 2010. In China, prevalence has grown from 9% to 38%. Infected adult bees carry the virus for up to six days without showing symptoms, and may spread it to other colonies at sites where different bees forage for food. But honey bees typically do not forage further than 10km in Britain, and the study found significant clusters of the disease up to 40km apart. A quarter of beekeepers have multiple sites, so could be assisting the spread of the disease. Although the disease appears to “burn out” in Britain and does not recur in hotspots between seasons, it returns to the country in other locations over time. The disease has also been found in wild bumblebee and ant populations, but the direction of transmission is not clear. Rob Nickless, chairman of the Bee Farmers’ Association, which supported the study, said: “This is the sort of research that brings practical benefits to the industry – helping bee farmers at grassroots level to improve honey bee health and increase UK honey production.” Researchers will continue to examine the genetics of the disease to determine if there is a new strain and seek to discover whether imported queens are bringing the disease into Britain, or whether those queens are simply more susceptible to the virus that is already here.
263	I had a couple of friends staying with me just before lockdown happened and we were like: “Let’s do it together”. Having my friends and partner with me, this time has actually been really nice. But it’s crowded. I find it funny watching people back at home [in Leicester] posting things such as, “What are you Londoners doing going out? Sit in your garden!” I’m like, really? We live in a two bedroom flat, there’s no outdoor area. We’ve all been cooking a lot and most nights we will sit together and watch a film. I’ve got a little French bulldog, she’s four months old and she’s making sure I get that hour of exercise every day. Damian Marley’s Welcome to Jamrock reminds me of being with my family, being a kid and things being easy. When I was younger, my mum used to play reggae in the house and the car. We’ve been listening to a lot of reggae in lockdown – when you’re cleaning and dancing around the flat, it’s a vital part of the morning. It just sets you up right for the day. Put Your Records On, that song makes me feel great. Corinne Bailey Rae was huge for me, growing up, because she was this brown-skinned girl with her curls out who grew up in Leeds. Even though I’m not from the north, it resonated with me more than artists from London. She really inspired me. That song for me is all about nostalgia and youth. Toosie Slide is a jam and it’s on every day. It’s been really fun because we’ve all just been pretending that we can do the little dance. I’ve been doing it in the kitchen, but I would never film it in a million years. HER just put a new song out called Comfortable – I play it mostly in the evening when I’m taking my makeup off or doing a little skincare routine. She oozes this really calming thing in her music and talks about love in the most delicate way. I love the way she shapes relationships, she does it exquisitely. A song I was playing yesterday, that I’d completely forgot I loved, is India.Arie’s I Am Not My Hair. She’s talking about the struggle that she went through as a black woman in the US with her natural hair. As a kid who struggled with that, it took me a long time to accept and love what I looked like. India.Arie was a huge part of that development. Quarantine has been difficult – I’ve definitely, in this time, gone through a journey with my confidence. Because we’re all not wearing makeup, not getting ready to go anywhere, it’s easy to feel a bit shit about yourself. That song is very empowering for me – that whole notion of: I am not my physical appearance, that isn’t all I am. When you have certain things that make you feel like you’re in control, it’s a lot easier to get up every day and get going. That’s why being able to write music at home was a huge plus for me. It meant that I had purpose again. When I was younger and first started writing songs, I began on [production software] Logic, using tools and working with vocals. So [going back to it] was like muscle memory. I was looking at a load of music in a file I’d created when I was making the album. I found these three songs, and I was like, oh my God, I love these songs – and it’d be sick if, in isolation, I could finish them and get them out. So I called my manager and we made a plan for a new release, Isolation Tapes. • Isolation Tapes by Mahalia is out now on Asylum Records.
264	When Europeans settlers first set their eyes upon North America’s Great Plains, vast seas of bison stretched as far as the horizon. But, more than a century ago, the last of the thundering herds that stampeded across the grasslands disappeared. But the birth of a wild bison calf has renewed hopes that rebuilding sustainable herds is now a step closer. On 22 April, a herd in Wanuskewin heritage park, an Indigenous-run conservation area in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, grew by one member — the first time a calf had been born on the territory since 1876. Hailing the new arrival as “historic”, Wanuskewin’s chief executive said the birth was a step in the right direction. “We feel humbled and blessed for the arrival the baby bison and for the herd that’s with it,” said Darlene Brander. Brander said that after consultation with a council of elders, the decision was made to not name the calf. “The elders told us that because bison are the brothers and sisters of many Indigenous peoples across the land, it wouldn’t be appropriate to give the newborn a name,” she said. “We’ve really been making effort to get guidance from elders on this, because their knowledge is critical to maintaining our traditions.” The fluffy orange calf is just the first step in a far more ambitious strategy to repopulate the sweeping landscapes. Bison numbers across the continent collapsed in the late 1800s — largely the result of overhunting by settlers, as well as disease and habitat degradation. Populations dropped from nearly 60 million to fewer than 600. Indigenous communities, which had long relied on plentiful bison populations, were left without a valuable source of food. “Our societies revolved around the bison — every single bit of it was used and consumed,” said Brander. “The near-extinction had a huge impact.” At the turn of the century, a handful of ranchers began breeding bison with cattle to create the “cattle-o” hybrid, hoping they would be better suited to the cold climate. “The idea was a reasonable one. But it really didn’t work very well,” says Dr Gregg Adams, head of the bison project at the University of Saskatchewan’s Western College of Veterinary Medicine. These hybrid animals now make up the vast majority of North American bison and only two herds —in Yellowstone national park in the United States and Elk Island, Alberta, Canada — are genetically pure. In Canada, only 1,500 wild, genetically pure bison survive— all descended from roughly 50 individuals that weren’t crossbred in the 1900s. But Parks Canada hopes that, by creating new herds across the country, more genetic resiliency and diversity will develop over time. Bison have already been reintroduced to Banff National Park, a feat Parks Canada calls a “historic, ecological and cultural triumph”. Such efforts are still threatened by the spectre of disease, but pioneering research at the University of Saskatchewan holds promise for overcoming such challenges. “We can literally wash the gametes — the semen and embryo — free of diseases, cryopreserve them and then bring them out of the park and use their genetics on other conservation herds,” said Adams. Even when a hybrid female is inseminated with purebred embryos, the result is a purebred calf. However, herds numbering in the thousands are unlikely to ever return. “We know now that there are too many roads, too many fences, too many borders, across the Great Plains. We’re never going to have these massive wandering herds of bison again,” said Adams. But some degree of repopulation will be possible – and will have immense benefits for the land. “There are numerous studies that show the impact bison recovery has for an ecosystem— all the way down to dung beetles, bird species, prairie dogs and carnivores,” said Adams. “Bison affect the entire ecosystem from microbes to insects to mammals and humans.” Wanuskewin – a historic bison hunting ground for numerous Indigenous groups, including the Cree, Assiniboine and Blackfoot people – received its first herd of plains bison in December as part of the repopulation effort. Eleven animals arrived, sourced from nearby Grasslands national park and Yellowstone national park in the United States. “When the bison were released from the trailer, people were overcome with emotion. Some tears shed, including my own. People just felt it in their hearts and souls,” said Brander. “To hear the sound of hooves thundering across the prairies, accompanied by the drums that were part of the ceremonial protocols, it was so powerful. It was a once in a lifetime experience.”
265	Hundreds of workers at Amazon warehouses, Whole Foods grocery stores, Target retail stores, and shoppers at Instacart and Shipt called out sick on Friday as part of a coordinated one-day strike across the US in protest of working conditions and inadequate safety protections during the coronavirus pandemic. The 1 May walkout began after Amazon ended its unlimited unpaid time off policy for workers at the end of April. “The fact they took it away prior to the sick-out lets you know they’re aware of the sickout and trying to stop people from participating in that,” said Derrick Palmer, an Amazon employee at the JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island, New York, who has worked at Amazon for more than four years. “Now they’re forcing people to go to work because if you run out of unpaid time off, that’s it, you’re fired.” Palmer was one of the workers who participated in protests outside of JFK8 warehouse a few weeks ago in demand of safety protections for Amazon workers. An assistant manager at JFK8, Chris Smalls, was fired shortly after he organized the protest. Palmer said that after the protests, Amazon began providing personal protective equipment to workers and enforcing social distancing rules and temperature checks, but he said cleaning procedures remain inadequate. “While we respect people’s right to express themselves, we object to the irresponsible actions of labor groups in spreading misinformation and making false claims about Amazon during this unprecedented health and economic crisis,” said the spokesperson in an email. At Target, workers complained it took too long for the company to provide workers with personal protective equipment, and little is being done to enforce social distancing within stores. According to Target Workers Unite, over 100 stores and some distribution centers are represented in the sickout. “I’m participating because Target Corporation has not designed or enforced adequate protection for its workers,” said Sophie Haras, who has worked at a Target store in Hadley, Massachusetts for over one year. “Social distancing guidelines are regularly ignored by both employees and guests, and the amount of customers allowed inside the store is in the hundreds, so high that my store leader, among others, has decided not to count customers at all. Target has also neglected to be transparent about positive cases of Covid-19, both in our stores and distribution centers.” Michelle Enright, a department specialist at Target in Sterling Heights, Michigan for 28 years, is participating in the sick out due to the lack of protections provided to workers during the pandemic. “There is no support from Target corporate,” said Enright. “What we want to do is make the point we are humans, we can get sick, and we’re not just pieces of a machine.” A Target spokesperson told the Guardian in an email: “While we take them seriously, the concerns raised are from a very small minority. The vast majority of our more than 340,000 frontline team members have expressed pride in the role they are playing in helping provide for families across the country during this time of need.” Whole Foods workers organized their first sick-out protest on 31 March, and are joining the 1 May day of action calling on more workers to join the sick-out and participate in organized protests. The sick-out includes demands such as increased hazard pay, paid sick leave for workers who choose to isolate or self-quarantine, and the closure of stores in response to confirmed coronavirus cases among workers. At least two Whole Foods employees have died from coronavirus, and over 200 workers have tested positive around the US. “We are organizing a sickout on May 1 to call on Whole Foods to provide the protective measures listed in our demands, which they have not provided despite internal complaints, a letter from fourteen state attorney generals, and concerns raised with OSHA,” said Dan Steinbrook, a Whole Foods employee in the Boston, Massachusetts area and one of the organizers of the sick out. A Whole Foods spokesperson disputed the claims of workers calling for the sickout protest. “Our focus right now is ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our Team Members, which remains our top priority, while continuing to serve our customers and communities,” said the spokesperson. Shoppers at Instacart organized their first sick-out protest on 30 March, and Shipt shoppers launched their own independent sick-out protest on 7 April. Vanessa Bain, an Instacart shopper in the San Francisco, California, area and an organizer of the sick out, noted few Instacart shoppers have received personal protective equipment kits in response to demands made during their first sick-out protest. She received a PPE kit, which included a paper-thin mask, hand sanitizer, and a thermometer that didn’t work. As Instacart hired 300,000 new shoppers in the month of April, and continues to hire more to keep up with increased demands for grocery delivery services, Bain asserts Instacart has to take meaningful action to protect workers and the public during this pandemic. “We’re trying to build a movement across companies and elevate each other’s demands,” said Bain. “We’re all in the same position as frontline workers making similar demands that companies have failed to meet that are basic and essential to be able to do our jobs safely.” An Instacart spokesperson told the Guardian in an email: “We remain singularly focused on the health and safety of the Instacart community. Our team has been diligently working to offer new policies, guidelines, product features, resources, increased bonuses, and personal protective equipment to ensure the health and safety of shoppers during this critical time.”
266	Joshua Haynes was raised to work hard and take care of his family without asking for outside help. But when the utility bills arrived last month, he knew there would be trouble. Haynes, 34, a construction worker from Newbern, Tennessee, was left without income after the governor issued a stay-at-home order in early April. As a cash-in-hand builder, he is not eligible to claim unemployment insurance, and the stimulus cheque still had not arrived. “I always pay my bills on time, but without work, I just didn’t have the money to cover everything, so I asked for an extension. They said no,” Haynes said. Haynes, who lives with his wife and three children, managed to get the money just six days after the bill was due, but the city refused to accept the payment unless he also paid a $70 reconnection charge. He didn’t have it, and the charge didn’t make sense as they had not been disconnected. A few hours after his payment was turned down, the taps were turned off, even as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urged people to frequently wash their hands in order to prevent the virus spreading. For a week, the family survived on sodas and microwave meals, cleaning their hands with gel and flushing the toilet with buckets of water filled at a neighbour’s. In the end, Haynes returned to work despite the stay-at-home order so that he could get an advance on his wages to pay the reconnection fee. “It’s wrong what they did, especially with so many people out of work. I felt angry and embarrassed. I’d never missed a bill before … I had no choice but to go back to work,” he said. Haynes is among a rapidly growing number of working people faced with impossible economic and health tradeoffs during the coronavirus pandemic – which has so far left more than 61,000 Americans dead and 30 million unemployed. A third of American households – about 120 million people – still risk having their water disconnected and racking up exorbitant fees, despite calls from a coalition of lawmakers and advocates to suspend all utility shutoffs until the country drags itself out of this unprecedented crisis. And while more than 600 localities and 13 states have mandated moratoriums on disconnecting residents since early March, some of these will soon expire as states reopen for business. In Tennessee, where the energy burden is also very high, the governor has resisted calls for a statewide moratorium, claiming utility companies – like socially distancing residents – can be trusted to do the right thing. So far, a handful of utilities serving 2.2 million, or 30% of Tennessee residents, have suspended shutoffs. None have agreed to reconnect households without running water despite the serious public health threat posed by poor hygiene. Deborah O’Barr, 62, from Goodspring, has lived without running water since 2016. It’s a complicated situation: she and her husband, Bobby, 63, who are both disabled, bought the house in a private sale, assuming it would be easy enough to get the water reconnected – it was shut off before they moved in because of unpaid bills. It was not reconnected, and for four years they have relied on a local spring and their son for water to cook with and drink, as well as rainwater for the toilet and cleaning. According to the local water department’s rules, O’Barr must prove that she is the legal homeowner, and then pay $1,050 for a new meter. But the deeds are still in the name of the previous owner, who is in prison on remand, and even if this could be resolved, O’Barr says she doesn’t have the money. “It feels like nobody cares. We must be the lowest of the low as far as the water company is concerned. We just don’t matter, not even during a pandemic,” said O’Barr. They are not the only ones without tap water relying on wells and springs, according to Connie Gatlin, office manager for Minor Hill water utility district. “[Mrs O’Barr] has been aware of the utility’s rules and requirements since 2016. [She’s] waited for the pandemic to bring it up again. It’s up to each [utility] board to decide about reconnections, that’s what the governor said.” “We need a state moratorium [on shutoffs],” said Brianna Knisley, of the advocacy group Appalachian Voices, who is concerned about the looming recession. “The stay-at-home order expired on 30 April, but many people don’t have jobs to go back to.” Even before the current crisis, water affordability was a growing nationwide problem, after years of price hikes left an expanding number of low-income households struggling to pay bills. As a result, some public water utilities increased shutoffs, ostensibly to encourage people to pay up on time: about one in 20 households were disconnected in 2016, according to research by Food and Water Watch (FWW). In addition, more than 2 million people do not have indoor plumbing – no running water or flushing toilet. Nationwide, nobody knows how many Americans were without water at the start of the pandemic – nor how many have been disconnected since. What is known is that financial aid to help families and utilities keep taps running has so far been excluded from federal rescue packages. The water and sewage industries estimate $26.4bn in lost revenue, mostly as a result of the industrial and business lockdown – which is fuelling concern that small towns may feel forced to sell off their utilities to big for-profit corporations. “It is appalling that the federal government is still dragging its feet,” said Mary Grant of FWW. “Congress must act in the public’s interests and order a national moratorium on water shutoffs while providing financial relief to our local public water providers. Our communities are in crisis and can’t wait any longer.”
267	Meera Navlakha, 22, is a Durham University student who has returned to Singapore. She says her sleep cycle is now “messed up”, making it difficult to study. “I have friends who take classes post-midnight,” she says, “and everyone is worried about exams.” Navlakha is one of many international students who have fled the UK to be with family without their belongings, and don’t know when they’ll be able to return to collect them due to lockdowns, border closures, or cancelled flights. International students from outside the EU are meanwhile paying the highest rates for their tuition. Some who went home are attending online lectures at night because of time differences. Harshita Iyer, 25, studying at the London School of Economics (LSE), is back in Canada with a five-hour time difference. “I’m lucky most of my classes are in the afternoon, but I know people who have lectures at 1am,” she says. She is also worried about how the time difference will affect her ability to do upcoming exams. Some who have returned home have internet problems. Shanavi Dessai, 18, who is one of around 400 international students at the University of Sussex to have signed an open letter calling on the university to reimburse their fees, is back in India. “It’s monsoon season here soon and electricity problems are rampant,” she says. “This is honestly horrible.” Alex Arroyo, 18, studying at the University of Portsmouth, is stuck in Menorca trying to study online without his laptop. “My return flight was cancelled and I’ve been in lockdown for five weeks,” he says. “I left everything in the flat.” Arroyo says he’s been using his iPad to study but can’t access all of the sites he needs. He studies in the kitchen, as the WiFi is better, but says it’s difficult to concentrate with all of the family stuck at home, too. For those stranded in the UK there are also difficulties. Bart Schermers, 23, is studying at LSE and has only just made it home to the Netherlands. He says he experienced a “nervous” atmosphere in his private student accommodation in London, which housed around 200 students. “On the floor below me a flat was sick [with coronavirus]. We use the same elevator, doors and hallways, so it didn’t feel safe,” he says. Schermers is on a rent strike to try to break his housing contract. Tama Knight, studying at LSE and from Canada, decided to stay put because her sister and mother back home are at high risk from Covid-19. Like Schermers, she says she was scared to stay in cramped university accommodation. Instead, Knight moved into her partner’s flat, but now faces the daunting prospect of having to pay thousands of pounds in double rent for six months, because she can’t get out of her student housing contract. “I don’t qualify for any financial assistance because I’m not a UK citizen, and [to qualify for financial assistance from Canada] you have to have been working for the past 12 months. It leaves me in a scary situation,” she says. Growing numbers of students are facing financial hardship during the lockdown, after losing work and support from parents. Dessai says many international students, who are not entitled to domestic loans and pay far higher fees, are also worried about how they will cope financially. Many students, including Iyer, lost jobs due to the pandemic. Loanna Siomou, 19, studying at the University of Bedfordshire, has recently made it home to Greece but was frightened at the prospect of being stuck abroad with little money – especially when she saw empty supermarket shelves, as she couldn’t afford to stock up. “It was scary to think I could have been stuck in a foreign country with nothing to eat because I couldn’t afford it,” she says. It’s perhaps particularly unnerving to be overseas during a crisis. “In many ways it’s harder when abroad,” Knight says. “I don’t know how I would get home, so it’s very stressful.” Many will have planned and saved for years to study in the UK. “International students came here with a dream,” Anne Marie Graham, chief executive of the UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA), says. “Many of them have travelled huge distances and left families behind. Studying abroad is a pretty emotional experience at the best of times, so to do it through a crisis is understandably really difficult.” Some universities are expecting to lose more than £100m as foreign students drop out as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Eva Crossnan Jory, vice-president for welfare at the National Union of Students (NUS), urges them to do whatever they can to support at risk groups such as international students. “It’s important [those studying] know they can engage with their students’ union at any time,” she says. For Navlakha, in Singapore revising for her exams, the sudden move has been difficult. “I wasn’t ready to leave and left a lot of my stuff behind,” she says. “I feel like my life is back in the UK. I just hope I can get back to take care of it.”

269	The Australian Institute of Sport has set out guidelines for how sport can get back under way following the coronavirus outbreak. The AIS framework, developed in conjunction with various medical experts and sporting organisations, is based on a three-tiered system – levels A, B and C – designed to facilitate the gradual resumption of activities in a “cautious and methodical manner”. On Friday the government released its 15 principles for the resumption of sport and recreation, which said the AIS framework would provide a general guide, but decisions on when to implement each phase would be made in close consultation with federal, state/territory and local public health authorities “Resumption of sport can significantly contribute to the re-establishment of normality in Australian society,” the AIS states in its framework document.

270	Scott Morrison has offered Australians an “early mark” to ease Covid-19 restrictions next week while warning a return to normality will depend on uptake of the Covidsafe contact tracing app. The prime minister dangled the prospect of a potential loosening of the rules next Friday as he issued his strongest declaration yet that it was conditional on more downloads. Morrison also revealed that net overseas migration is down 30% and is expected to fall by 80% in 2020-21, both compared with 2018-19, in a sign the economic contraction from Covid-19 will last much longer than restrictions to social life. Treasury officials and the Reserve Bank both estimate that unemployment is set to top 10%. The first restrictions were eased this week with New South Wales allowing visits to friends and relatives, and a similar measure announced on Friday in the Australian Capital Territory, the first Australian jurisdiction with no active cases. The ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, described allowing family visits and resumption of non-essential retail as a “downpayment” on further changes to be considered next week, expected to include allowing small outdoor gatherings as a first step out of the lockdown. Morrison said two further meetings of national cabinet were scheduled next week and then leaders would decide next Friday “about how restrictions can be eased”. Morrison told reporters in Canberra that 3.5 million Australians have downloaded the Covidsafe tracing app, explaining that boosting downloads is one of four unmet conditions to ease restrictions. “We need that tool so that we can open up the economy,” he said, declining to nominate a precise target. “It’s over to you, Australia.” Morrison acknowledged the need to tread carefully. “We do not want to go into a start-stop or – even worse – a reverse process into the future,” he said. The health minister, Greg Hunt, had previously suggested a target of 40% – which would suggest as many as 10 million Australians would need to download the app – but that figure was disavowed by health department officials who have said even 20% would be a good result. Morrison noted that regulations governing the app prevent employers mandating employees download it, but suggested businesses, including cafes, would encourage their patrons to do so in a bid to restart the economy. Appearing alongside the sports and aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, Morrison announced an extra $205m for the aged care sector to implement an industry code of practice on protection against Covid-19. Colbeck said the national cabinet had developed a set of principles for phased resumption of community sport, starting with non-contact activities with 10 or fewer participants ramping up to full contact training and competition. According to a government statement, the initial phase allows for the resumption of children’s outdoor sport with strict physical distancing measures for non-sporting attendees such as parents, and outdoor recreational activities including outdoor-based personal training and boot camps, golf, fishing, bush-walking, and swimming. But the principles note that “individual jurisdictions will determine progression through these phases”. Even with the prospect of restrictions being eased, the economic impacts of the coronavirus crisis continue to mount. Morrison said Australia was facing a “significant fall” in net overseas migration which would trigger a “lag impact” on the Australian economy beyond the immediate health crisis. He argued it was not a “long-term” change, suggesting it would be reasonable to assume borders would be open by the end of 2021, but he noted Australia had outperformed expectations in the past six weeks. Morrison revealed some 650,000 businesses had signed up to the jobkeeper program, an increase on the 540,000 businesses and 3.3 million employees reported by Treasury officials on Tuesday. Morrison played down the possibility of further changes to the $130bn program, noting that there are “many calls” on the federal budget – including jobseeker unemployment benefits – and the commonwealth has “no plans” to change eligibility of either program beyond administrative changes. Morrison also said it was too soon to say whether the free childcare package would be extended beyond late June, when it is due to expire. The government has previously kept the door open to having it in place for six months, similar to other support packages, but there have been lingering concerns across the childcare sector that their normal funding is down. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said testing for Covid-19 would be expanded to include samples of certain groups that were not showing symptoms – including health and aged care workers and elective surgery patients. The aim of this testing, Murphy said, was “to make sure that our confidence that we don’t have significant asymptomatic transmission is correct”. The government’s latest modelling on the effective rate of transmission covers fewer states than last week, because of a lack of data. In the two states where there were adequate figures – NSW and Tasmania – the rate of transmission remained below 1, meaning one person with the virus transmitted it to fewer than one person on average. Murphy said Tasmania was comfortably now below the 1 benchmark, as it had brought the outbreak in the north-west of the state under control.
271	It’s an unusually stacked week for new films on Netflix (one they might regret when pre-pandemic content starts to dry up) with a teen comedy, a B-thriller and a romantic documentary all launching before the weekend, a feast for viewers at home but a glut that could overshadow one of their finer offerings quietly releasing alongside. All Day and a Night, a tough-minded drama from Black Panther co-writer Joe Robert Cole, might not be quite worthy enough for their awards slate (although it’s a damn sight more compelling than The Two Popes …) but it’s a step up from what one might expect of an unhyped May movie from the streamer. Think of it as a classier boutique release, deserving of a higher shelf placement. We first meet Jahkor (Ashton Sanders) as he’s breaking into the house of a couple before shooting them both dead in front of their young daughter. The film them splits into three timelines, each delicately balanced by Cole, as we see Jahkor as a child (played with heartbreaking conviction by Jalyn Hall) abused by his addict father JD (Jeffrey Wright), Jahkor getting involved in criminal actvities in the months before the killing and Jahkor in prison. It’s a reflective movie, with a reflective title, as he revisits the ups and downs that led him to a life sentence and while the film offers explanations, it never offers excuses, with a considerable grey area at its centre. What’s initially most striking about All Day and a Night (other than the intensity of Sanders’ stare) is just how much it feels like an actual movie. Discarding the flat TV palette so many other Netflix-funded film-makers seem happy to stick with, writer-director Cole clearly has something a lot grander in his sights and he squeezes every last drop from his limited budget, working as if the intention was for a far bigger screen. It’s stylish work but Cole avoids gimmicky flourishes, which would have been an easy fallback given the material, and instead maintains an evocative aesthetic while providing a number of standout visual sequences – one particular one-shot party that takes us from inside a venue and out through the streets is more cinematic than most Netflix originals combined. Some of his turf war plotting is a bit muddled but it’s his character study of a boy who’s not quite sure how to be a man that proves more interesting. Via an often insightful and often hackneyed voiceover, Jahkor talks about the prison he was born into, how as a young black man living in a working-class neighbourhood he has always been surrounded by four walls, they just became more noticeable when he was sent away. He speaks of the little cuts, the micro-aggressions he has to encounter from the the teacher who has already given up on him to the racist white customer at the shoe store where he works who’s already judged him to the cops who are eager to imprison him, the cuts that slowly make him bleed. His toxic father is both aggressor and victim himself, an addict with mental health issues without the help he so sorely needs. Cole makes some moves toward blaming a bigger system, one without the resources or empathy to help people at the bottom, but ensures that his characters are never just victims, they’re active in their choices even if their choices are limited. It’s a messy world and Cole refuses to make it more palatable for us, inspiring tough questions while withholding easy answers. There’s a small but ferocious turn from Wright but it’s Sanders who dominates, building both on his standout performance from Moonlight and his film-elevating work since in Native Son and Captive State. While I look forward to seeing him expand his repertoire with something a bit more left-field in the future, he’s on fine form again here, rising to the challenge of his biggest lead to date, drawing us into Jahkor’s plight even when his actions are hard to defend. He’s a difficult character, the result of a difficult father, and while their scenes together are limited, Cole refrains from obvious soapy conflict, opting instead, finally, for something far more believable and far more poignant. Jahkor is being told not to follow in his father’s footsteps, including by his father himself, but not being given the tools or room to do so. It’s a sad but not entirely hopeless tale with an ending that offers room for interpretation, based on the viewer’s optimism or pessimism over what could come next. All Day and a Night is a weightier alternative to the average Netflix original and while imperfectly realised and scrappily plotted at times, it’s another promising sign that, away from the easy-to-digest content, there’s room on the platform for much much more. All Day and a Night is now available on Netflix
272	Last year I wrote a literary biography of HG Wells, a task that, of course, entailed reading all his novels. I already knew his science fiction and some of his other novels, but I’d never read his first world war masterpiece Mr Britling Sees It Through, which was published in 1916. To this day I don’t know anyone who has. Yet in its day this was one of Wells’s most successful books (it was the bestselling novel in the world in 1917) and attracted hyperbolic praise. Maxim Gorky called it “the finest, most courageous, truthful and humane book written in Europe in the course of this accursed war”. Strange to think a book so fêted and successful could drop so comprehensively off the radar. What makes it stranger is that the novel is exactly as good as Wells’s contemporaries thought: a wonderfully detailed, evocative and moving portrait of England at war. Britling himself is a Wellsian self-portrait: a successful writer, living comfortably in his Essex home of Matching’s Easy; married to his second wife, raising a son, Hugh, and two stepchildren, and conducting a discreet affair with an attractive neighbour. Part one, Matching’s Easy at Ease, compiles a leisurely but compelling portrait of the long Edwardian summer of 1914. The second part, Matching’s Easy at War, describes the impact of the war on the home front. Hugh lies about his age and signs up, and his letters to his father are full of vivid detail about life in the trenches. When he is killed – a freak shot catches him through a “loop” in the trench’s defences – the novel pivots to a heartbreaking account of his father’s grief. As the novel ends, Britling is reaching a fragile but hopeful epiphany, his atheism dissolving into a belief in God. This ending could easily have struck a merely sentimental, or an awkwardly pious, note, but in fact it does neither. It is testament to Wells’s skill as a writer how moving the conclusion is. This is a novel that portrays war not as an arena for action and heroism, but as a passivity, a state in which there is nothing to be done and everything to be endured. Of course that’s how war is for those left at home, but what’s remarkable is the way the novel’s portrait of the western front, via Hugh’s lengthy letters to his father, describes the fighting in these terms, too. Wells’s soldiers are not agents; their war is one of stalemate and inaction. That reflects the nature of trench warfare itself, of course; and while this became a commonplace of how the first world war was described, Wells’s novel was one of the first to capture this. It also includes the first portrait in fiction of what we now call PTSD, or “shell shock”. When his friend Captain Carmine returns home on leave, Britling is startled to find the soldier broken, “white and jaded, as if he had not slept for many nights”. Britling himself is a masterpiece of characterisation: wholly believable, often silly and pompous but rounded and real. Wells really doesn’t spare any of his own foibles in his self-portraiture. But though he is comical at the beginning, he ends the novel with real dignity: Britling, this little Briton, “sees it through” in the sense that he endures and survives the trauma of war. (Look!, as DH Lawrence’s end-of-war poetry collection famously exclaimed, We Have Come Through!). But more importantly, Britling sees through “it”, the muddle and pain of mundane existence, to something transcendent. There seems to me something wise and important to be learned from such a tale, and most especially today, as we all languish in the enforced passivity and misery of our present moment.
273	Online streaming of public court cases should become the norm during and after lockdown to create a more transparent and fair justice system, Labour has said. David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, and Charles Falconer, the shadow attorney general, have written to the government calling for an emergency action plan to restart the “incapacitated” justice system and for longer-term changes. The letter to the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, proposes measures to address “systematic and historic failings” that have left courts “critically weakened long before the coronavirus crisis began”. It says many victims and defendants are “being left in limbo as trials are being postponed indefinitely”. Courts and tribunals should maintain physical distancing during the pandemic, Labour’s justice team says, and all court cases – with the exception of certain criminal, family and youth cases – should be streamed online and accessible to all. That should continue after the Covid-19 crisis, Labour says. The letter from Lammy and Falconer also advocates investing in early advice services and legal aid to expand access to justice, as well as greater financial support to ensure barristers’ and solicitors’ firms can survive the crisis. All jury trials and many non-urgent cases have been suspended during the lockdown but most of the higher civil courts – the supreme court, court of appeal, high court and family court – are conducting remote hearings via video links. The media, but not the public, are being given online access. The supreme court already livestreams its hearings, and some court of appeal hearings are also broadcast live. This year the Ministry of Justice backed expanding camera use in court so that judges sentencing convicted offenders in high-profile criminal cases in England and Wales, including murders, rapes and other serious offences, can be televised. Lammy said: “There were already huge backlogs in court cases before the Covid-19 crisis began. If urgent decisions are not made now, the justice system will be at breaking point by the autumn. “Many large courtrooms, university lecture halls, schools and leisure centres are currently sitting empty. The Ministry of Justice should co-opt these buildings if necessary to carry out socially distanced trials according to public health advice. Justice delayed must not be allowed to become justice denied.” He said open justice was a fundamental right but current restrictions on non-essential travel meant most members of the public could not attend court. “To maintain public confidence in the justice system, with a few exceptions, all court cases should be streamed online,” he said. “Labour is calling for the livestreaming of cases to become the norm during and after the Covid-19 crisis because a more transparent system is a fairer system, which gives greater access to justice for us all.” A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “Judges and staff deserve huge credit for keeping dozens of courts open during this pandemic, and have overseen a vast increase in video and audio hearings. The public can be confident that we are doing everything possible to ensure justice is still seen and heard, for instance through remote hearings. While jury trials were suspended to protect the public, we are working closely with the judiciary and others to resume them as soon as possible.” The Labour letter says the opposition wants to work constructively with the government, but “we have serious concerns regarding not only how the justice system has become incapacitated by the crisis, but also around how our critically weakened infrastructure will cope with the enormous challenge it will face post Covid-19”. A first priority must be rebuilding services and restoring some of the legal aid which since 2012 has been stripped from most areas of early legal advice, including housing, family matters, employment, welfare and immigration. To continue the suspension of trials for an “indeterminate time would result in a backlog of cases which could seize [up] the wheels of justice for many years to come. The government must act urgently to allow jury trials to restart in a way that is safe,” the letter says. However, Labour does not support proposals for allowing jurors to participate in trials remotely from home. “Unfortunately, many people across the country do not have [quiet or private rooms] or access to the required technology. Until comprehensive solutions are found to prevent remote juries from becoming socially unbalanced juries, we cannot support them.”
274	‘Look at me now” is a fitting opening line for Good to Know, the fourth studio album from R&amp;B singer JoJo. The artist has been on a storied journey through the music industry and the public eye: first emerging as the 13-year-old singer of Leave (Get Out), she then spent years mired in legal disputes with her label that prevented her releasing music. After reigniting her passionate fanbase with a string of independent, darker-sounding mixtapes (and one viral Drake cover), she released Mad Love, her long-delayed third album, in 2016. But Good to Know, released on her own imprint Clover Music, with its themes of independence and self-knowledge, carries with it a sense that she has finally arrived as the kind of artist she was always meant to be. Slowed down to a treacle pace and layered in indulgent harmonies, these bass-rich songs are the most mature JoJo has ever recorded. It’s a hangover album (one spacious, swirling song is named Pedialyte, for the rehydration drink), all about making clear-eyed assessments of past bad decisions in the light of day. JoJo picks herself apart, whispering about not being able to get over an ex on Think About You, and belting about her insecurity on Lonely Hearts. Her voice, always impressive, is now an intimidating muscle, and while her message occasionally brushes against empowerment-pop cliche, the naked passion in her vocal sells every line. In light of her legal battles (and recent accusations that her former record label once put her on a 500-calories-a-day diet), her declarations of self-love also carry special import. On Man, the album’s stand-out single-lady anthem, JoJo sings: “I’ve been down, but I’m back up.” It’s a joy to hear.
275	Comedy writers do like a challenge, don’t they? Especially lately, with their “Let’s find the laughs in suicidal ideation” (Aisling Bea’s This Way Up) or “Examining the return to normality after serving 18 years for murder, but with lols” (Daisy Haggard’s Back to Life). Haggard, of course, also stars in Breeders, a similar comedy cliff-face, a brutally honest, brutally funny study of what real parenthood, the kind shorn of sentimentality, looks like. And yet, somehow, they surmount it. All of the above are bold, shining little nuggets of gold, alchemised from what, to the rest of us, looks like lead. Now it is the turn of Andy Wolton, whose show Trying – the 23rd original show from Apple TV+ and the company’s first European production – is a comedy about adoption in the wake of a couple’s infertility. Obviously – obviously – individual viewer’s mileages will vary with this even more than with most comedies, depending on how close to home it strikes and how raw or painful any personal experiences still are. But it seems to me that Wolton – an adoptee himself, who made a pilot a few years back about a family of adopted children called The Coopers vs The Rest – treats the subject with compassion. As is so often the case, the opening episode isn’t its best – there is an over-reliance on the traditional dramatic tropes of the childless couple (making awkward jokes about fontanelles to new mothers and so on), but it quickly finds its feet. The couple’s situation isn’t exploited for laughs – the absurdities inherent in it are explored, which is different. Call centre operator Nikki (Esther Smith) and Tefl teacher Jason (Rafe Spall) are in their 30s, very much aware that the people in the bars they used to frequent unthinkingly are now all 10 years younger than them. They have been trying for a baby long enough to have exhausted their NHS IVF cycles but have enough hope left to partake of emergency shags on public transport when they realise this month’s ovulation window is about to close. Then they find out that because of “complications” – ages, durations and medical details are all wisely kept vague – a baby of their biological own will never be possible. “Let me get you another leaflet,” says the doctor. So, amid the endless round of pregnancy announcements and christenings that characterise your mid-30s as surely as weddings do the decade before and STIs do the decade before that, they begin to consider adoption. Can they, should they? When they haven’t even got the lampshades up in every room yet? They retreat, then talk themselves and each other round again, with truths both tongue in cheek (“We’ve only got to be better than the previous parents”) and bitter (“We waited till we were ready once before, didn’t we? And we were far too late”). Once they have decided, finally, in favour, the profound, dizzying unnaturalness of having to codify and commodify yourself into a potential parent via forms and questionnaires instead of simply having sex and a baby quickly engulfs them. In the second episode, they realise that ex-partners will be approached for what are, in effect, references and Jason must arrange a meeting with Jane (Cush Jumbo), the woman he was with before Nikki. In fact, not entirely before Nikki, which makes things awkward. But in the first of many mini-plotlines that will turn from comedy to tragedy and back again, it is not the memory of his infidelity that ends up hurting Jane most but the realisation that Jason has become “the man you hated me for telling you you could be … You’re a better man because you practised on me.” It’s a scene that has been done before, but I have never seen it done less hysterically or given so much time to breathe. And even more rarely – for myriad reasons – have I seen what happens next. Jason is allowed the right of reply. “It wasn’t my intention,” he says. “It’s just … life.” The adoption content is the flesh, but it is moments such as these, relatable surely in one way or another for any member of the human race, that provide the skeleton. The genuinely loving, intimate banter between Nikki and Jason in their quieter moments too is one of the series’ greatest strengths. All this and Imelda Staunton as their social worker Penny still to come. It’s well worth trying.
276	Winnie Happy Days “Another heavenly day,” exclaims Winnie, while trapped up to her waist in a huge mound of earth. Samuel Beckett’s Happy Days is effectively one gargantuan monologue and there is something about its limited horizons – and the achingly persistent optimism of its protagonist – that touches a nerve right now. Weirdly cheering – and chilling. ‘Let Faustus live in hell a thousand years’ Doctor Faustus Doctor Faustus’s final speech in Christopher Marlowe’s play, as the gates of hell yawn open, will scorch itself on to your memory. It is one of the most distilled expressions of fear – and pure longing for life – that you’ll ever hear. Listen to Dylan Thomas recite it online and shiver. A sweary final speech Fleabag The best bits of Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s play – currently streaming on Amazon Prime – are not the shocking or sexy moments, but glimpses of vulnerability. There is the quietly profound chat with cafe regular Joe and then there’s Fleabag’s final speech, full of loneliness, fear – and plenty of fucks. ‘Of comfort no man speak!’ Richard II Bolingbroke is in the ascendancy and Richard is on the way out. In one spellbinding monologue, a king lets his mask slip and confronts his own mortality, and the scant protection a crown provides. You can find stunning renditions from Ben Whishaw and David Tennant online. ‘He was a boy’, Blanche DuBois A Streetcar Named Desire Blanche DuBois is typically remembered as a fading beauty, teetering on the brink of mental collapse. But Tennessee Williams’s fragile heroine is also smart, sensitive and exceptionally perceptive. Her speech about young love – tingling with hope and loss – is unforgettable.
277	Profits at Royal Bank of Scotland halved in the first quarter after the taxpayer-owned bank set aside more than £800m to cover a surge of bad debts caused by the Covid-19 crisis. RBS announced on Friday that pre-tax profits had fallen to £519m in the first three months of 2020, comparedwith just over £1bn a year earlier. Profits were hit by an £802m provision, a sum set aside to cover potential loan losses due to an economic downturn that could make it harder for its retail and business customers to repay their debts. Analysts were expecting a £515m charge, according to consensus estimates compiled by the lender. The Edinburgh-based bank, which is changing its parent name to NatWest this year, said the group “has significant exposures to many of the commercial sectors that are already being impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, including property, retail, leisure, travel and shipping”. Alison Rose, the chief executive, said: “Having been involved and worked through the financial crisis, I’m aware of the importance of the financial stability and strength and liquidity of the bank which is a core priority for me.” She assured that RBS was well diversified going into the crisis: “We’re comfortable with the level of risk on our books, including the new lending and the government schemes.” RBS accounts for the largest proportion of lending through the UK’s government-backed coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS), which has been widely criticised for being slow to distribute funds to struggling firms. The bank has so far approved £1.6bn to 8,292 businesses, or 31% of the 25,262 total. RBS said it had a share of about 20% of the small and medium-sized business banking market. The chief financial officer, Katie Murray, said while CBILS would not be hugely profitable for the lender she expected a “nominal return” from the loans. Rose said it was inevitable that some businesses would fail during the crisis, but RBS has not yet had a surge in insolvencies or payment delinquencies as customers have taken advantage of government support. Across the entire bank, Rose noted a slowdown in spending and a rise in deposits during the lockdown. RBS forecasts a 4.3% drop in UK economic growth for 2020. “Of course we will suffer losses on our books as the crisis plays out, but we think it’s too early to estimate the shape and scale of the economic impacts,” Rose said. The RBS provision brings the total loan loss charges announced by the five largest UK banks to about £7.4bn for the first quarter. A provision of £1.4bn nearly wiped out first-quarter profits at Lloyds Banking Group, which fell 95% to £74m. On Wednesday, Barclays reported a 38% drop in pre-tax profits after taking a £2.1bn charge to cover bad debts, which it predicted could soar to £4.5bn by the end of the year. This week HSBC warned it could end up setting aside $11bn (£8.8bn) to cover loan losses for 2020, after the pandemic hit its main markets across Asia and Europe. It reported a first-quarter charge of $3bn (£2.4bn). Standard Chartered also revealed a $962m (£776m) loan loss charge on Wednesday that pushed first-quarter pre-tax profits down 29% to $886m. RBS, which is still 62% owned by the taxpayer after its £45.5bn bailout in 2008, also announced it was winding down its fledgling digital retail bank, Bó, months after its launch in November. It plans to fold the technology into Mettle, its digital bank for small and medium-sized business customers.
278	Anybody accumulating evidence for the existence of old souls could do worse than check out the Hampshire-born trumpeter-composer Laura Jurd’s contribution to jazz in the eight years since her remarkable debut album, Landing Ground. Jurd seems unconcerned by transient fashions or enrolment in any kind of scene, and pursues a private muse that draws on jazz, folk traditions from Europe and the Middle East, and the harmonic language of Stravinsky – yet her work is always spiritedly accessible, and often suggests wordless songs. To the Earth is Jurd’s third release with her Dinosaur quartet, a closely bonded ensemble embodying the jazz axiom that composition and improvisation are an inseparable two-way stretch. These seven tracks run to barely more than than 40 minutes but Dinosaur make them all count. The title track hooks attention with its opening treble-chord piano splash from Elliot Galvin, signalling Conor Chaplin’s repeating bass vamp, the arrival of a vivacious trumpet melody of folk-dance triplet twists and coolly jazzy resolutions, and Corrie Dick’s implacable percussion pulse. The dirge-like, ghostly Slow Loris finds Jurd in a voicelike early-jazz mood of muted trumpet sounds and growls (sometimes deepening the brass harmonies on tenor horn), while Galvin solos in unhurried Monkish dissonances. Mosking (also a Dinosaur single release) is a jubilant jig inspired by Norwegian piano trio Moskus. And the classic-Ellingtonian sound of Billy Strayhorn’s languidly slow-swinging Absinthe (the only cover) is tweaked by the most sparing of spacey synth tones from the otherwise unplugged Galvin. Blues and gospel colours seep through the later stages of Jurd’s jazziest Dinosaur album, but this is an open-handed celebration of jazz’s century of eloquence and influence, not its trade secrets. • Out on 15 May. Also out this month Former Miles Davis guitarist John Scofield rekindles a long association with the bassist/composer Steve Swallow on Swallow Tales (ECM), an all-Swallow repertoire with Bill Stewart on drums on which Scofield has rarely sounded so laid-back, playful and up for anything. Young UK composer/trombonist Tom Green releases Tipping Point (Spark! Records), an ingeniously contrapuntal repertoire for a septet that sounds twice the size, informed by composers from Maria Schneider to Avishai Cohen, and never forbiddingly intricate. And the ever iconoclastic African-American pianist and Cecil Taylor heir Matthew Shipp celebrates his 60th birthday with The Piano Equation (Tao Forms), a typically densely layered and sometimes inscrutable solo venture that, like all Shipp’s work, repays more than a nonchalant listen.
279	In these lockdown times, we should all be scrambling to watch films that will help us to make sense of our out-of-life experience, no? Pandemic thrillers, online horrors, dystopian sci fi – these can all teach us what we need to know, right? Maybe, maybe not. When the real-life news is vastly more consequential than anything the cinema can cook up, surely it is time to dive into the past. Nothing bad ever happened then, did it? As it turns out, the wastelands of pre-1970 Netflix mean there’s little material to go on. I would have tried My Man Godfrey if Pamela Hutchinson hadn’t got there first. But what’s this? Not one, but two brilliant Edward G Robinson film noirs from his late-1940s golden period: The Stranger and The Woman in the Window. This was when Robinson was at the top of his game, exuding a world-weary righteousness in Double Indemnity and playing the sap in a pair of outstanding Fritz Lang tragedies, of which Woman in the Window is one. (The other, Scarlet Street, was a remake of Jean Renoir’s first film, La Chienne.) The Stranger, perhaps, is the more interesting film, and ties into Robinson’s own off-screen life. Though his beaten-up mug was to be seen numerous times in the first part of his acting career as a hoodlum or villain – most notoriously in Little Caesar, the 1931 role that put him on the map – Robinson was in fact a sensitive, art-collecting, anti-fascist of the old school, whose family escaped antisemitic riots in Romania, sailing to New York when Robinson (then plain Manny Goldenberg) was 10 years old. He donated a quarter of a million of 1940s dollars to charitable causes during and after the second world war, and even though he aired his disgust of communism as he named names at the Huac hearings, had his career derailed in the 1950s by an unofficial political “greylisting”. In The Stranger he distils all that in his role as UN investigator Wilson, working a complicated bait-and-switch by releasing a Nazi minion called Meineke, in the hope that he will lead him to the big fish: Franz Kindler, who is posited by the film as the designer of the final solution – “the most brilliant of the younger minds of the Nazi party … who conceived the theory of genocide”. Kindler, of course, is played by Orson Welles, rather more plausible (if we are being honest) as the raffish schoolteacher Kindler is aiming to pass himself off as than an Eichmannesque architect of the death of millions. Another part of The Stranger’s allure is that it’s a pit-stop in Welles’s relatively brief Hollywood career, an attempt to rebuild his profile after the savaging that RKO had inflicted on The Magnificent Ambersons. It was his third credited directing job (though purists might also include Journey into Fear) and appears to suggest Welles was in relatively contrite mode, trying to prove he could make a straightforward studio picture on time and on budget. Well, as it turned out, The Stranger is the closest Welles ever got to a bona fide commercial hit (to paraphrase Alan Partridge, it was only the film Citizen Kane could have been). Reports suggest that Welles was largely powerless in the face of Universal’s “supercutter” Ernest Nims, the studio editor who Welles described as his “nemesis”. Well, even so, The Stranger has a lot of great stuff in it, from the down-home checkers obsessively manning the till at the local cafe, to the gloriously shadowy photography courtesy of Russell Metty (who would work on Welles’s even more extravagant Touch of Evil a decade later). Welles even contrives a suitably noir-gimmick ending, atop a very rickety ladder, where Kindler is stabbed to death by the moving figure of a Teutonic-looking medieval swordsman on his beloved clock. (Oh, the irony.) The rather sketchy nature of what Kindler is accused of shows that the grim details of the Holocaust had yet to percolate very far into American culture, though Welles did make a point of including a brief series of vérité documentary shots of concentration camps to provide what would now be called a teachable moment. However, The Stranger, principally, brings home the enduring theme of noir: the devastation that the second world war wreaked on the American psyche, and the silent nastiness that proliferated behind the white picket fence. (Nothing new, of course, if you were African American or First Nation.) Unearthing a war criminal as he marries into the family of a supreme court justice is a fairly uncomplicated deployment of the motif – but in these dislocated times it’s a reminder that once the American establishment took exception to Nazis. Somehow that seems a long time ago. The Stranger is available on Amazon Prime and Netflix in the UK and US
280	The Apex was nearly finished. A brand new cruise ship for the Celebrity Cruises line, it was a towering, 117,000-ton vessel with luxuries like a “resort deck” featuring martini-glass-shaped jacuzzis and a movable platform cantilevered off the side – known as “the Magic Carpet” – to be used as an outdoor restaurant. As the builders put the finishing touches to it, the company held parties for crew and contractors, even as the rest of the world was shutting down to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Alexandra Nedeltcheva was one of the waiters. Though she avoided the parties, she served the contractors and crew at one of the ship’s restaurants. She says she contracted Covid-19 before the Apex even left port. “It’s really scary, you don’t know how long it’s going to last,” says a coughing Nedeltcheva. She says she had trouble getting anyone to respond to her calls for medicine and help. “When I called medical and said, ‘can you get me some medicine, my head is going to explode’, they said, ‘there are people sicker than you, stay where you are’.” She is one of more than 100 Celebrity Cruises crew members who have joined a class-action suit filed against the company on 14 April, alleging it failed to take timely action to protect workers, despite having weeks of notice that coronavirus was spreading worldwide. The ship is not an exception. Across the world, a Guardian investigation has uncovered at least 50 ships facing outbreaks of Covid-19 among the crew. Nedeltcheva, who managed to catch a charter flight to her home city in Bulgaria, may have been one of the lucky ones. Upwards of 100,000 other crew members – including hundreds of her colleagues aboard the Apex – remain trapped on their ships. Most have no communication with the outside world, and the ones who do are often scared of losing any prospect of future work by complaining. In the course of the Guardian’s investigation, however, a portrait has begun to emerge of what is effectively a nation of floating castaways, marooned on boats from the Galapagos Islands to the port of Dubai. The first cruise ship to face Covid-19 cases, the Diamond Princess, was quarantined at dock in Japan for two weeks starting on 3 February. But cruises kept departing until mid-March. Although most passengers have since been repatriated, Covid-19 outbreaks continue to spread among the crew stuck on the ships. Last week employees aboard the Queen Victoria, which had just pulled into Southampton, were told they would have to quarantine in their cabins for 14 days because Covid-19 cases had been confirmed aboard, according to a recording of the captain’s announcement obtained by Business Insider. In the US the situation was so grim aboard the Oasis of the Seas, from which rescue crews have repeatedly evacuated sick workers to hospitals in Florida, that the captain made an announcement over the loudspeaker asking crew members not to video their co-workers being taken off the ship in ambulances, according to an account from an employee given to the Miami Herald. Another member of the class-action suit against Celebrity Cruises, which is owned by Royal Caribbean, is Julia Melim, a US resident who hosted the Celebrity Infinity’s shopping and port-tourism show on the shipboard TV channel. Melim was one of only seven crew members allowed to leave the ship in Miami last week. The rest remain aboard. She says there was so much sickness that the ship’s medical personnel cleared out the whole third floor to isolate and treat people who had symptoms. The cruise industry says cruise lines were just as blindsided by the pandemic as the rest of the world and that those on ships haven’t suffered higher infection rates than those on land. A spokesperson for Celebrity Cruises said: “We have no higher priority than keeping our guests and crew safe, healthy, cared for and well-informed. We have at all times worked in close coordination with government and health authorities and are grateful for their guidance. We are working with all appropriate authorities to ensure the safe return home of all our crew members.” The Cruise Line Industry Association says it is still assembling information on how many of its ships have been affected, but says it so far knows of 899 confirmed cases of Covid-19 on board 15 ocean-going cruise ships. “This accounts for 0.06% of confirmed cases globally,” said the association in a statement. “It is hard to tell how many of those confirmed cases are crew members, as we are still in the process of collecting that information as well.” Those numbers appear to grossly underestimate the problem, given that the Diamond Princess alone had more than 600 cases. Another cruise ship, the Ruby Princess, which is blamed for spreading the disease around Australia in March, has now surpassed the Diamond Princess in the scale of its deadly outbreak – 21 people died and 900 were infected aboard the ship. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has specifically identified cruise ships as being global spreaders of coronavirus. “Cruise ships are often settings for outbreaks of infectious diseases because of the semi-enclosed environment and contact between travelers from many countries,” said a 4 April CDC order, barring those leaving cruise ships from taking any commercial flights in the US. “Outbreaks of Covid-19 on cruise ships pose a risk for rapid spread of disease beyond the voyage.” Most ships have only one doctor and a few nurses for thousands of passengers and crew, workers say The ships generally rely on hospitals on shore for urgent care. Because of the pandemic, however, the US and other ports are refusing to take all but the most dire cases. “They are basically getting no healthcare,” says Michael Winkleman, the attorney in Miami who filed the class-action suit. “They are locked in their rooms and told they can call an advice line for help. But when they call, no one comes.” Cruise lines have little recourse in seeking government help for urgent healthcare. While many of the major cruise companies, including Carnival and Royal Caribbean, are headquartered in the US, the companies are registered in low-tax countries. Carnival is technically a Panamanian company and Royal Caribbean is registered in Liberia, meaning they pay almost no US taxes. Likewise their ships are typically flagged in countries such as the Bahamas or Bermuda, which allows them to avoid strict safety standards, labour laws and environmental restrictions they might otherwise face in the US. US Coast Guard officials said in a memo on 29 March that outbreaks aboard ships are straining the rescue and medical resources in the Florida region. The bulletin, first obtained by the Miami Herald, asked ships carrying more than 50 people to prepare to provide their own medical care to those onboard for extended periods. “Foreign-flagged ships that loiter beyond US territorial seas, particularly those registered in the Bahamas” should seek assistance from the countries where they are flagged, it added. Officials in the Bahamas responded with their own memo, saying the medical system of the tiny Caribbean island nation would be overwhelmed if it had to take on caring for all those sick aboard cruise ships. “The cruise industry is facing an unprecedented crisis, and we in the Bahamas, facing the same global crisis, are doing what we can to provide support,” said the statement by the ministry of transport and local government. “Our system is not designed to deal with a massive influx of new Covid-19 patients from outside our country.” On some ships, crew members say they are being treated well, and some have been moved to passenger cabins with balconies and more space in which to spend their quarantine. Crew on the Celebrity Serenade made a parody video of their time confined to their cabins at sea. Some reported getting bonuses from their cruise lines. The Celebrity Edge, currently floating in the Bahamas, distributed a video of the ship’s captain delivering meals to the rooms of quarantined workers. On other ships, the situation is dire. Workers have complained that food seemed to be running out, and that they were forced to pay for internet time. Many crew have had their pay cut off entirely. Workers on board several ships run by the Geneva-based MSC cruise line, according to letters from MSC seen by the Guardian, are no longer being paid after their contracts ran out or were terminated early by the company because of the global pandemic. A spokesperson for MSC cruises said: “MSC Cruises has taken the difficult decision to temporarily suspend its cruise ship operations. As this health crisis has caused all our ships globally to stop operating, we have temporarily agreed to relieve the majority of our crew from their duties and are working to identify and pay for flight tickets for each and every one to safely return home for the duration of the temporary suspension of ships’ operations. We are offering all those who remain on board full board and lodging free of charge, assigning each of them a guest cabin for individual use.” A former crew member for another major cruise liner, Krista Thomas, who lives in Vancouver, has been running a private Facebook group to update crew members at sea about how to get home. She says many crew are scared to speak out. They depend on the cruise industry for livelihoods, and cruise ship pay – while low compared to average wages in many developed countries – is often many times higher than what they can earn at home. “They’re probably not just taking care of a wife and kids; they’re taking care of parents and in-laws,” says Thomas. “They are living contract to contract to get by … They don’t want to tear the industry down. It has taken a huge hit because of what’s happened and they don’t want to see their industry fall apart.” Ross Klein, who has written books criticising the cruise industry and runs a website that reports incidents involving cruises, says crew members from developing countries “are in as close to indentured servitude as it gets”. He argues that the cruise companies bear a responsibility to care for them. “The workers are powerless,” he says. “The employers have a moral and ethical duty to care for these people they brought from around the world. There have got to be ways to work out a solution to get these people safely home.” Alexandra Nedeltcheva, still experiencing the symptoms of Covid-19, has had to pay for an Airbnb to quarantine near her home in Bulgaria, so she doesn’t expose her family. She still worries about her friends aboard the Celebrity Apex in Saint-Nazaire in France. There, as of 14 April, two workers remained hospitalised with severe Covid-19 and 700 crew were still working or isolating, according to a report by a French TV station. Nedeltcheva says she has enjoyed seeing the world in her 11 years working with Celebrity Cruises, but the treatment she says crew have received during the pandemic has opened her eyes. “I really want something to change,” she says. “They can take much better care of their crew. It’s time the cruising industry does better.”

282	Harold Macmillan was British prime minister from 1957 to 1963. A charming Tory with a patchy record, he’s usually remembered for saying that during his government Britons had “never had it so good” in their standard of living. What has been forgotten, almost completely, is that he said this in the middle of a pandemic. Macmillan made his claim on 20 July 1957, at a party rally in Bedford. Like Boris Johnson, he was a new premier with a preference for optimistic public statements. In 1957, the British economy was actually quite fragile, and Macmillan acknowledged this in his speech, but the idea that Tory rule kept Britain prosperous and safe was central to his premiership. As now, the party had already been in power for years, and needed to present a Labour government as a terrible risk. The pandemic, of a new strain of flu, had started in China the previous winter. During the first half of 1957 it steadily moved across Asia and then the rest of the world, killing hundreds of thousands of people, to the alarm of the world’s media, including the British press. In June, the first cases appeared in Britain. Yet that month, and again in July, Macmillan’s health secretary, Dennis Vosper, refused to make a public statement setting out the threat the flu posed, arguing that it was not spreading in the UK. By August, the virus was all over north-west England. Macmillan finally began to pay attention. He asked another health minister, John Vaughan-Morgan, for his department’s view of the situation. Vaughan-Morgan replied: “The general assessment seems to be that eventually [the flu] will affect up to 20% of the population.” But he insisted that the virus was more a public relations than a medical problem: “This is a heaven-sent topic for the press during the ‘silly season’.” The government advised those with symptoms to stay at home, but otherwise took little national action as the flu spread right across the country during the autumn, instead leaving it to local medical officials to work out what to do. In some areas, schools were closed, but few sporting events or other mass gatherings were cancelled. In October, the peak of the outbreak in Britain, the Conservative party conference went ahead as usual. Macmillan’s speech didn’t mention the pandemic. The outbreak continued into the winter, and ultimately may have killed more than 30,000 Britons. Senior medical figures were horrified at Britain’s performance. John Corbett McDonald of the public health laboratory service wrote to Ian Watson of the Royal College of General Practitioners: “Although we have had [over] 30 years to prepare for what should be done in the event of an influenza pandemic” – since the previous one in 1918 – “we have all been rushing around trying to improvise [solutions]. We can only hope that … at the end it may be possible to construct an adequate explanation of what happened.” Many critics of Johnson over coronavirus are hoping for a similar reckoning. The government is expecting one, too, judging by its goalpost-shifting rhetoric, such as the prime minister’s highly selective boast this week that Britain had “defied so many predictions” about the impact of the virus. But for Johnson’s critics, the fate of Macmillan’s government in the aftermath of the 1957 pandemic is not a reassuring precedent. During the later months of the crisis – not a point the government has reached yet – the Tories’ poll ratings did fall sharply. But by the time the next general election came, in 1959, the pandemic had receded. The Labour manifesto didn’t even raise the government’s handling of it. The Conservatives talked up their economic record instead, and won easily, increasing their Commons majority to 100. In Britain, it remains disconcertingly easy – and a sign of how lopsided our democracy is – for Tory governments responsible for disasters to change the subject. The rightwing bias of the press, worse now than in the 1950s, as there are fewer left-leaning papers, is the obvious villain. But equally important is a reluctance from voters to face up to the sheer scale of what the Conservatives have sometimes got wrong. The 1957 flu catastrophe came the year after the disastrous British military intervention at Suez – also under the Conservatives, and supported by Macmillan – which destroyed much of Britain’s credibility as a world power. Similarly, the British coronavirus failure closely follows the Tories’ chaotic Brexit U-turns and hugely counterproductive austerity. Yet in both eras, many voters have avoided coming to the unsettling conclusion that, quite often, their default ruling class simply isn’t up to the job. It’s more comforting to believe, as Johnson promised this week, that after its latest calamity, “the UK will emerge stronger than ever before”. Our national myth often revolves around recovery from disaster. In this narrative, failures by the state – such as the second world war setbacks that led to Dunkirk – just create opportunities for future, greater successes. As a politician preoccupied by history, and not very good at governing, Johnson understands this well. His much-admired optimism is really a form of cynicism: as he blunders through the present, he keeps the possibility of better times for Britain in the future floating perpetually in the distance, like a mirage. Can the Tories’ cynical optimism and evasions of responsibility ever be effectively pointed out? They can if Labour has a sharp enough leader. In 1957, Macmillan was mocked in parliament for his “never had it so good” speech by the shadow chancellor. With deft sarcasm, Harold Wilson called the speech “remarkable”. Wilson became Labour leader in 1963, as Macmillan’s supposed economic miracle finally petered out, and won four of the next five elections. Keir Starmer might do well to get some old tapes of him out. • Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist
283	It is almost five years since Scott Davies last placed a bet. Losing everything on the 6.30 at Goodwood led him to the brink of ending his life and, ultimately, to seek help for a crippling addiction that put paid to his promising career as a professional footballer. “It was 8 June 2015,” he says, with total recall. “For the first time in my life I got scared and that was when I first reached out to my parents.” In nine years he lost about £250,000, plus £50,000 of his parents’ money, after gambling 80-90% of his wages. These days, he educates players about the dangers of gambling on behalf of Epic risk management, gambling harm-minimisation consultants. The latest Gambling Commission report found 0.5% of people aged 16 and above are classified as problem gamblers but data collected by Epic from every EFL club across 2018-19 identified 7.2% of first-team players as potentially problem gamblers: people who have an urge to gamble continuously despite harmful consequences. This month the PFA reported a rise in players accessing mental health support, with its director of player welfare, Michael Bennett, concerned about an increase in players gambling because of coronavirus. The global players’ union, Fifpro, announced the percentage of players reporting symptoms of depression had doubled since the shutdown. Last week a player confided to Davies his recent struggles. “He said he was missing the changing-room banter and bravado, and that he doesn’t have much to turn to in terms of support because he lives by himself. He had been off gambling for a few months and thought he was in control of it but this [pandemic] has set him off again. The recent figures don’t surprise me, sadly, but the only slight satisfaction is that players are reaching out. Suffering in silence is the worst thing you can do.” Davies, funded by the PFA, spent 26 days in rehabilitation at a Sporting Chance clinic and understands the temptation facing players. “If I had to go through this now, I would try to make ends meet by gambling. If someone asked me to take a 30% pay cut in the height of my addiction, when I was earning a couple of thousand a week at Crawley, I would think: ‘I’ll try and win that 30% back’. That is a vicious circle because, as a gambling addict, you’re out of control and reckless with your behaviour. It’s a recipe for disaster.” The absence of routine can also pose problems. “As a professional footballer you get told what time to be at the training ground, what time training is starting, what time to have breakfast, what time you’re going to finish and, basically, you’re mollycoddled … Now when you get up in the morning, you might go for a run or do some exercise but that will only last for an hour or so, so what do you do to get that buzz, that rush of scoring a goal? How do you replicate that? “Gambling is often the one people turn to. Sportspeople are competitive and want instant gratification … People are scratching around trying to bet on other avenues in online betting systems, and that’s a danger in itself, be it slot machines, blackjack or roulette, which are dangerous because it’s just numbers on a screen – not hard cash. It’s not until you check your bank account that you realise how much you have lost.” At present Davies is limited to virtual sessions but continues to educate EFL players and staff to ensure they understand potential gambling risks, rules around betting integrity and how to look for signs of potential harm. A common trend is experienced players dropping down the leagues and trying to finance a champagne lifestyle on lemonade money. After a workshop at a Championship club last year, Davies says a high-profile player revealed he had a gambling problem. “He looked like a picture of health and wealth; he was wearing a gold Rolex and dripping in Gucci, but it just shows you don’t know who is struggling. You can hide it quite well.” Eight years ago Davies crashed into a car close to home because he was watching horse racing on his phone. “I said: ‘Sorry, I’ve fallen asleep at the wheel, I play football, I’ve had a double session today.’ I looked and there was a kid sat in the car seat in the back and for the first time in my life I felt guilty about what I was doing. I thought: ‘I’m bringing other people’s lives into danger.’ “But I didn’t know how to stop, how to end this pain I was going through. I gave the driver £500 that I had stuffed away in my car – money I had won that day. I drove home and cried myself to sleep. That was a massive wake-up call.” Davies began betting at 16, while earning £50 a week at Reading, and sometimes walked four miles from his digs to training because he could not afford the £1.20 bus fare. From there, his addiction spiralled from playing poker on the Aldershot team bus to haemorrhaging his £30,000 signing-on fee at Crawley inside three weeks. “There were times when I used to sleep in my car after training because I couldn’t afford to get home. I would rather put my last £20 in a roulette machine, in the hope of turning it into a few hundred, than towards fuel to make sure I got home safe that night. Once after a game I slept at a service station and woke up in the freezing cold thinking: ‘What has my life become?’” In 2009 he impressed Brendan Rodgers during pre-season at Reading and was given his Championship debut aged 21. Davies was highly rated, but his addiction consumed him. “I was sneaking out of training when players were doing extra and I got pulled into the manager’s office and told to be more professional. I was always the last into training and the first out because I had a date every day and that was with the bookmakers; it was all I thought about. “The following day I got caught sneaking out of training again. When I got pulled into his office I told him I had a dentist appointment and that was the reason I had to shoot off. I knew deep down I was lying to him but I didn’t want to show a sign of weakness and say: ‘Listen, I’m struggling with gambling addiction.’ I never played another minute for Reading and that’s one of the things I have to deal with every day now. If I think back to how I was doing, it hurts.” Davies, who had spells at Oxford and Wycombe, now plays for Slough Town. “For me, it’s not so much about the money I’ve lost,” he says, “but probably about the career I should have had.” • In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

284	I don’t normally have a lot of time to watch TV because I’m generally working a lot, so at the moment during lockdown I’ve been catching up on my own show, Gordon, Gino and Fred: Road Trip. Gordon Ramsay, Gino D’Acampo and I travelled across the US in September – it was such an epic and emotional adventure. It is so lovely to relive those moments now. It is even more special because, with lockdown, we can’t go back on another adventure. It really was the trip of a lifetime. There were so many moments that didn’t make it into the show, but out of the ones I remember most fondly there was a day when we went and did goat yoga, which was really surreal and fun. We all laughed until the cows came home. I also remember visiting Gordon’s mum when we competed at her house to make a burger and, of course, out of the three of us, Gordon won. I think she chose him because she wanted to see me and Gino naked in the pool – which was the forfeit for losing. What was really interesting to me was seeing the restaurant scene across the US and how they do things very differently from us here, especially in San Francisco. It’s very forward thinking there, particularly with the designs of the restaurants, where they tend to just be one open room with kitchen and dining together, not like the open kitchens we have here that are still separated. When I think about it now, I feel very sad because all of these people have to close their restaurants. We have such wonderful memories of so many great people who welcomed us with open arms and now they are out of work and might not be able to come back. I’d love to go out and film another season and visit new places, but I think it’ll be a while before we can do that. I’ve never been to Thailand, Laos, Cambodia or Vietnam, so they would be incredible to visit. I’d also love to go back to South America, where I travelled when I was younger. I’ve been keeping busy, though, with a bit of work. I have also been exercising every day, doing a lot of cooking and playing with my kids. I’m also speaking almost every week with Gordon and Gino during the lockdown. It’s difficult for everyone at the moment but it’s also difficult on different levels. We all have to be thankful for what we have; when I flush my toilet or have a shower, I’m so grateful I have that level of luxury and can also put food on the table when there are people queueing up for food banks. We’re all in this together and we have to be disciplined to try to do the right thing so that more don’t suffer. I have to show by example and take things day by day because I don’t expect a quick resolution. First Dates Hotel is on Channel 4, Thursdays, 9pm
285	Heavy snow has fallen on deserted resorts across the high country, as a wintry blast swept south-eastern Australia on Friday. Parts of the Australian alps that were devastated by the summer’s bushfire crisis were blanketed with early falls. More than 20cm fell at Thredbo and surrounding mountains in two days, with more forecast. The Bureau of Meteorology recorded 180mm of precipitation at the resort, which spent the first few weeks of 2020 with bushfires raging on three sides. But the snow has fallen on an empty resort, with national parks in New South Wales and Victoria shut due to the coronavirus. The heavy snowfall comes three weeks before the resort recorded a similar dump last year, with 25cm falling on 27 May. The 2019 season also saw 10cm fall on 1 April, and a spokeswoman from the resort said it was “not uncommon to receive early season snowfall” before the NSW ski season officially opens in mid-June. Perisher ski resort, which is north of Thredbo in the Snowy Mountains, has recorded 16cm of fresh snow, with 131mm in the bureau’s rain gauge. Selwyn Snow Resort, which was destroyed by the fires along with the abandoned mining village of Kiandra, received 13cm of snow. Across the border in Victoria, the historic Mount Buffalo chalet was doused in pink fire retardant and surrounded by sprinklers as a fire raced up the side of the mountain over summer. On Friday morning, Mount Buffalo’s ski fields, which are higher up the mountain than the chalet, had 16cm of fresh snow. David Chitty, who runs the Mount Buffalo ski school, had to content himself to watching it via the snow camera as the Mount Buffalo and Alpine national parks remain closed. Falls Creek had 20cm of snow, with another 10cm forecast to fall, and Mount Hotham had 16cm. The ski season does not officially open until the Queens Birthday weekend, on 8 June. Falls Creek ski resort has still pencilled in opening night fireworks but the rest of its events calendar is blank. National parks in Victoria and New South Wales remain closed, and residents are still not allowed to travel for non-essential reasons. Queensland, Western Australia and the NT have opened national parks this week, and some are allowing fishing and camping and other outdoor sports. It could mean that alpine towns such as Bright, Thredbo and Jindabyne miss out on their second-busiest season of the year, having lost the summer to bushfires and Easter to the coronavirus shutdown. Victoria’s shutdown laws are due to be reviewed on 11 May, and the national cabinet has said it will review the national baseline restrictions on 8 May. Chitty said he was hopeful that restrictions may be eased. “I think there’s a chance that visitors will be able to visit the snow in some form over this winter,” he said. “The hard thing is managing social distancing.” His business will survive, he said, because he started setting aside a “war chest” against national disasters following the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires. “I have been operating since the 1980s so I have been through all the disasters,” he said. Off the mountains, Melbourne recorded its wettest start to the year since 1855. More than 400mm of rain has fallen in the city since 1 January, compared to just 49mm in the same period last year. Friday is on track to be the coldest ever start to May in Melbourne. The maximum temperature is forecast to reach 12C. The previous record for a chilly first of May is 12.8C. At midday, it was just 11C in the city. Damaging winds are forecast for alpine areas in NSW and Victoria, and coastal areas of Victoria and Tasmania.
286	Ryanair is planning to cut 3,000 jobs and reduce staff pay by up to a fifth in response to the Covid-19 crisis, which has grounded flights. The no-frills airline said it was cutting 15% of its 20,000-strong workforce as it did not expect passenger numbers or pricing to return to pre-coronavirus levels until summer 2022 at the earliest. As part of a programme of sweeping cost cuts, Ryanair said it could close a number of bases across Europe until air travel recovers. The chief executive, Michael O’Leary, took a 50% pay cut for April and May and has now extended this until the end of March next year. O’Leary said the package of measures, which include unpaid leave for staff, represented the “minimum to survive the next 12 months”. He told the BBC: “If a vaccine isn’t found then clearly we may have to announce more cuts and deeper cuts into the future.” The company, which expects to report a net loss of more than €100m (£87m) for the first quarter and through the summer, said restructuring and job losses would start in July. The job cuts will affect mostly pilots and cabin crew, although the measures will also hit head office and back office teams. The company said: “Ryanair now expects the recovery of passenger demand and pricing (to 2019 levels) will take at least two years … [We] will shortly notify their trade unions about its restructuring and job loss programme.” It said it would operate less than 1% of its scheduled flights to the end of June, with passenger numbers down 99.5% in the first quarter and halved in the second quarter, but should “return to meaningful flying from July”. It expects to carry fewer than 100 million passengers for the year to the end of March 2021, 35% less than its original target of 154 million. Ryanair is in talks with Boeing and Airbus to reduce aircraft orders over the next two years to “more accurately reflect a slower and more distorted EU air travel market in a post-Covid-19 world”. O’Leary launched a broadside at the €30bn in state aid packages accepted by rival airlines across Europe, arguing that Ryanair would struggle to compete without a level playing field. “Air France and Lufthansa are subsidy junkies hoovering up state aid,” he saidon BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We support transparent non-discriminatory schemes like payroll support. Why does Lufthansa need another €12bn on top of that? It means that for the next three to five years they can engage in below-cost selling. We face unfair competition against legacy airlines in Europe getting unfair state aid.” Ryanair said it intended to challenge the state aid awards in European courts. O’Leary also addressed complaints from customers about the difficulty in getting refunds for cancelled flights. The airline is offering vouchers in the first instance. “If you want a cash refund you will get a cash refund,” he said. “We will give you your money back. Nobody has to fight for a refund from Ryanair.” O’Leary said the issue was not Ryanair being obstructive but the sheer weight of refund requests slowing the system while staff numbers were reduced. He said the airline would normally process 10,000 claims a month but was currently dealing with a backlog of 25m, covering cancellations from March to May. O’Leary said the business was working through March refunds, which could take two or three months to complete. He said customers who required refunds for flights in May would have to wait four to six months.
287	Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has opened Queensland’s border for next month’s planned NRL restart, ensuring Brisbane, North Queensland and Gold Coast will avoid relocating to New South Wales. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, had said earlier on Friday it would be a matter for state jurisdictions to clear any resumption of sporting activities, following a meeting of the national cabinet. Palaszczuk not only gave the green light for the state’s three NRL clubs to train at their base and travel interstate but also host home games. “I said I was as keen as anyone else to see the NRL return and I meant it,” Palaszczuk said. “The only condition was that it did not put our excellent work containing the spread of Covid-19 at risk and the chief health officer advises that the NRL plan is workable.” But the New Zealand-based Warriors have not yet been given clearance to travel to Australia, ahead of the planned return to training on Monday and a season resumption on 28 May. “No amount of reporting” would change that, Morrison said, after the Nine Network had reported earlier in the day that the national cabinet had approved the Warriors to fly into Tamworth on Sunday. A decision on that will be made on the basis of assessment by the Australian Border Force, which is ongoing. “When they’re in a position to authorise it, they will,” Morrison said. The NSW state government has also yet to grant exemption for the Warriors to train as a group should they spend two weeks in quarantine. But league officials remain confident those exemptions will be secured in time for the team to be in the country by next week. “The Warriors will be on the plane,” the ARL Commission chairman, Peter V’landys, told AAP on Friday. “I clarified all those matters. I’ll have it in writing to them once I get all the border security and state government approvals. The Warriors just wanted clarity on a few things and now they have got that they are fully supportive.” V’landys had spoken with Warriors players amid fears of a player revolt as they unified to address concerns about relocating. Warriors players will receive the same pay as the rest of the NRL, with all players to receive 80% of their original annual salary. Talks with broadcasters remain ongoing to determine exactly how much money will flow into the game this season. Families of Warriors players will remain in New Zealand for now, although the league is hopeful border restrictions will eventually ease. Players across all clubs will return to their bases on Monday for a briefing on biosecurity laws, however they have yet to commit to a return to training. Friday’s cabinet meeting also set a range of principles for the broader resumption of sport and recreation activities, from professional leagues to grassroots competition. The principles draw heavily on the Australian Institute of Sport’s framework for rebooting sport across the country, Morrison said, and spoke to the “need for community sport to be moving”. According to the principles, any return to the playing field should not compromise the health of individuals or the community. It will be based on objective health information and introduced in a phased fashion, initially for small groups of less than 10 people in a non-contact way. With Australian Associated Press
288	Three generations of working mothers. My grandmother, at home with 10 children between the wars, took in sailors’ washing to make ends meet. She had no schooling after the age of 12 and remained a “housewife”, dependent on my grandfather. In the 1950s my mother, a school-leaver at 14, worked part-time while her three kids were small, then full-time in the accounts office of a big department store. In the 1970s my older sister left home, trained as a teacher, married and also had three children. She retired a headteacher on a professional pension; her life was poles apart from my grandmother’s. Yet all three women led “double lives”, fitting their paid jobs around housework and childcare. Their labour was also typically female. Laundry work such as charing or cleaning has been a perennial standby for the poorest women in society. Girls like my mother, with some schooling, turned to the factory, shop or office work; those with more qualifications have been ushered into the “caring” professions such as nursing and, above all, teaching. “There are no typical lives,” Helen McCarthy writes in her impressive and nuanced study. Each is unique. But the best history writing, like hers, shows how representative the individual life is. Double Lives begins in the mid-19th century, but its vantage point is very much that of the present. Three quarters of British mothers now work, an astonishing shift from the Victorian era. And a mother’s desire to earn independently is largely viewed as legitimate. Yet despite this cultural sea change, and despite inroads made into all the professions, the majority of working mothers are in low-paid, insecure jobs with rigid hours and no childcare. Just as their Victorian predecessors finished garments or glued matchboxes, today’s home-workers make baby slipper-socks or attach crystals to greetings cards. Well into the 20th century the majority of British men and women, including most feminists and women’s organisations, argued that motherhood was a woman’s prime vocation. Women entering the professions felt they must choose between mothering or a career. The “good” mother only worked because she had to. A deserted wife, a widow or a lone parent was to be pitied. The “bad” mother worked because she wanted to. How much, McCarthy asks, has changed? The ideal of the male breadwinner, always able to earn enough to keep wife and children at home, no longer holds sway. But today’s employers and policymakers still mostly assume “the worker” to be male. Social welfare provision all too often merges the needs of the mother and child and sees the wife as dependent on her husband. The home is still imagined to be the mother’s – not the father’s – place. McCarthy’s is an economic and social history, but she also wants to give “shade and texture” to what has been thought and said about working mothers. In this she succeeds magnificently. She is as much at home with popular novels and journalism as she is with cabinet memos, parliamentary commissions, employment law, or sociological reports. She never treats her sources as gospel, neatly characterising much early social investigation into the lives of the poor as “a genre-crossing blend of statistics and sentiment, empiricism and emotionalism”. And always the voices of working mothers are raised above the cacophony of official and unofficial commentary. The worst-off women were never simply victims. While the majority certainly worked from economic necessity, they could also enjoy their jobs. Home-workers were often proud of their skills. Industrial employees relished the camaraderie and the taste of freedom. One young mother in a Midlands jam factory met with disapproval from a female inspector when she confessed she would hate to stay “at ’ome all dye to mind the blessed byby – it ’ud give me the bloomin’ ’ump!” She spoke for many in the decades to come. Double Lives sometimes reads haltingly as it hedges its arguments. The early 20th century saw droves of women take up clerical work, but new marriage bars limited their prospects. Wartime administrations called up mothers for their reserve army of labour, focusing on their needs and even providing workplace nurseries, but only for the duration. Part-time work expanded enormously after the second world war, thanks to a consumer boom, but employers used its temporary nature to justify unequal pay. Treated as a stopgap between matrimony and childbearing, or as extra housekeeping for the older mother returning to work, part-timers often found themselves without any chance of promotion, refused sick pay and holiday entitlement. Two steps forward, one step back. In the long run, though, the figure of the working mother became more ordinary and acceptable. McCarthy writes with calm authority. But she is not neutral. “The narrowly conformist” 50s come in for particular criticism. Yet in that decade far more mothers, like my own, found satisfaction in working outside the home. Double Lives is dubious about theories of “maternal deprivation”, such as John Bowlby’s or Donald Winnicott’s, which have so often been used as a stick to beat working mothers. A history of childhood experience would obviously be a different book; McCarthy’s few retrospective testimonies leave the issue wide open. In the postwar decades a second income became a source of pride and prosperity. Higher aspirations were inextricably linked to consumerism, on spending for the home and on leisure. Today’s two income families have inherited the assumption that personal fulfilment is linked to buying and having more. Families have shrunk in size since reliable contraception and abortion have gradually become available – a seismic shift for many women, who are no longer subject to endless childbearing. Double Lives says little about new forms of peer pressure to have children, or the burgeoning commodification of motherhood (Mothercare, founded in 1972 and now defunct, would be a case in point). McCarthy’s final chapters chronicle recent advances – in employment law, pay battles, and anti-discrimination policies. More working mothers than ever find self-esteem and economic independence in many more walks of life. They speak out more in public and they are listened to. But still they are guilt-ridden and often exhausted. While the media has amplified and distorted debates about “the selfish mother”, the women “who work too hard”, and those who want to “have it all”, the competitive individualism of many professional workplaces is hardly feminist, let alone enjoyable. The language of professionalisation gives women status but reproduces male corporate models of marketisation (McCarthy, a historian at Cambridge, briefly refers to her “line-manager”). So-called empowerment comes at the expense of an underclass of other women doing the housework, the majority of them black or from ethnic minorities. Men haven’t shifted that much into domesticity or childcare. And in some communities husbands still prefer their wives not to work. At different times both Labour and Conservative administrations after 1945 invested in maternity services and nursery education. McCarthy argues that despite ideological differences, governments have gone on viewing the interests of women and families as one and the same thing. In the 70s feminists critiqued the family for shoring up the housewife’s role and for enshrining children as possessions. Fewer of us now live in conventional families, but the rhetoric of the family, preferably “hard-working”, is still constantly deployed. As the cornerstone of conservative visions of social life, the family remains idealised. During the current pandemic, as so often in past crises, women, and especially mothers, are being asked to shore up this fantasy while working twice as hard. • Alison Light’s A Radical Romance is published by Fig Tree.

289	Migrant workers on Spanish farms that provide fruit and vegetables for UK supermarkets are trapped in dire conditions under lockdown, living in cardboard and plastic shelters without food or running water. Thousands of workers, many of them undocumented, live in settlements between huge greenhouses on farms in the southern Spanish provinces of Huelva and Almeria, key regions for European supply chains. Local union activists have been supporting the migrants, bringing them water, food and basic supplies since Spain declared a lockdown in mid March. Clare Carlile from Ethical Consumer, a UK UK campaign organisation crowdfunding to support the local activists, says the situation is the result of years of neglect of workers. “They got visited by the Spanish army on the 18th of March and told to stay put, even though in some places running water is several kilometres away. Now, with Covid fears, a water truck comes twice a week. If you are at work and miss it you must walk several kilometres for water after a hard day. “Failure of employers provide basic rights has for years created dire circumstances for the inhabitants of the settlements. Now, the pandemic has pushed the situation to crisis point.” The workers fear they are unprotected against the virus, both in the unhygienic settlements and when working side-by-side on the farms. Amadou, who is from Mali, is a member of the Collective of African Workers, a grassroots organisation campaigning for an end to the shanty towns in Lepe settlement, Huelva province. We’re living here, feeling scared and afraid, because up until now we haven’t received any kind of help, not in terms of water, gloves, or face masks,” Amadou told Ethical Consumer. Soc-sat, the local agricultural union, is providing food, soap, medicine and nappies for babies in settlements in Almeria and Huelva, while groups say promises have been made by the local state but have not yet materialised. The Guardian has repeatedly reported on dire and sometimes exploitative conditions in the fruit and vegetable picking regions of southern Spain that supply berries and salad to supermarkets across Europe. Spain is the main fruit and vegetables producer in the EU. Around half of the goods – from salad picked in greenhouses to citrus fruits – are for the export market. Nearly all, 93%, goes to the EU market: Germany France, the UK. The regions of Huelva and Almeria, where migrants are now struggling under lockdown, are key parts of this cross-Europe supply chain. Huelva is where 97% of the Spanish berry crop is grown; in Almeria, workers producer around 35% of Spain’s total fruit and vegetable exports. Last month Philip Alston, the UN Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, visited Spain; his report was highly critical of the conditions for migrant workers in Huelva. “I visited areas I suspect many Spaniards would not recognise as a part of their country,” Alston said. “In Huelva, I met with workers living in a migrant settlement in conditions that rival the worst I have seen anywhere in the world. They are kilometres away from water, and live without electricity or adequate sanitation. Many have lived there for years and can afford to pay rent, but said no one will accept them as tenants. They are earning as little as €30 (£26) per day … In 2018-19 the strawberry crop in Huelva was worth €533 million euros. Recent weeks have seen concerns across Europe that supply chains will falter under the pressure of increased consumer demand and more difficult working conditions. The estimated third of the workforce of migrant farm labour who do not have the legal right to work have faced many difficulties under lockdown. Last week a coalition of 27 NGOS called for regularisation of migrant farm workers as well as proper protection from Covid-19. One of the charities, Caritas, said: “The Covid-19 crisis and lockdown measures are … putting the spotlight on how acutely the EU’s agricultural system depends on migrant workers. Now that many of them have returned to their home countries, or cannot access the fields due to travel restrictions, vast amounts of fruits and vegetables are at risk of being left unpicked. “In the fields and in many food-processing plants, labourers toil close to one another with no protective equipment. We call on states to ensure that migrant workers ... are provided with decent working conditions and granted immediate legal papers to remain.” Spain will lift the lockdown in the coming weeks but activists say the situation is still dangerous for vulnerable workers, with lack of water and workplace protection putting workers at ongoing risk of further Covid-19 outbreaks.

290	Mikhail Mishustin, the Russian prime minister, who was tasked by Vladimir Putin with leading the response to the country’s coronavirus outbreak, has been diagnosed with Covid-19 and will self-isolate. Mishustin, Russia’s most-high profile Covid-19 patient so far, disclosed the diagnosis during a televised video call with President Putin on Thursday evening. It was not immediately clear how severe Mishustin’s symptoms are, though one news agency reported that he had an elevated temperature of 39 degrees. Putin indicated during the call that Mishustin would be taken to hospital. Confirmed coronavirus cases in Russia passed 100,000 on Thursday. The first deputy prime minister, Andrei Belousov, would take on Mishustin’s duties in his absence, Putin said. “Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich, I have just found out that the tests I gave for coronavirus have come back positive … Accordingly, I will go into self-isolation, fulfilling my doctors’ orders. This is necessary to do in order to protect my colleagues,” Mishustin told Putin during the call. It is unlikely that Mishustin has been in direct contact with Putin in recent weeks. Putin has led semi-regular video calls with members of the government from his residence at Novo-Ogaryovo. He has not been pictured in public recently. In his remarks, Mishustin urged Russians to take the disease seriously and follow the difficult self-isolation rules that have been imposed by the government. Earlier this week, Putin announced that he would extend the country’s “non-working days” through the May holidays, including the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany. “Dear Mikhail Vladimirovich, what is happening to you right now can happen to anyone, I’ve always said so. You are someone very active, I want to thank you for the work that has been done until now,” Putin told Mishustin. “When you get to the hospital, I’ll be waiting for your call,” he added.
