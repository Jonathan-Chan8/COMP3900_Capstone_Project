1	Mauricio Pochettino admitted that his Tottenham players gave up towards the end of the humiliating 7-2 Champions League defeat at home to Bayern Munich, which represented a new low in a difficult season. The manager watched his team give everything during an entertaining first half, in which they led 1-0 and created chances before going in 2-1 down at the interval. The second half was a horror show, with Serge Gnabry, the former Arsenal winger, scoring four times as Bayern ran riot. The German champions twisted the knife with three goals in the final seven minutes. Pochettino kept his players inside the dressing room for some time after the final whistle but when he emerged, he stressed that calm analysis had to be the order of a traumatic evening. His message was that he and the players needed to accept the defeat and deal with the consequences. “The feeling at the end when we conceded the three goals – it was like the team was tired and gave up a little bit,” Pochettino said. “Maybe that showed a little bit our frustration with the game because up until 82 minutes, the team were alive, we were fighting, trying to create chances to score [for 4-3]. “I told you many weeks ago that this is going to be a tough season. After the final of the Champions League last season [when Spurs lost to Liverpool], it was a chapter closed and now the club is in a period when they need to open another chapter and decide a project – medium, long-term. You need to show your quality like a man first; to face [the defeat] like a professional, like a man. What comes after is the professional side. Now we need to be men and be strong all together; try to bounce back and change the feeling. “We had to take a risk after conceding two goals in the first eight minutes of the second half [for 4-1] and that gave them space to run and you can concede like this. We are so disappointed. I feel so bad because when you concede seven goals it is tough. “But you need to face up to this type of situation. When you play the final of the Champions League, it was nice to put your face up after the wins we had at Manchester City and Ajax. Now I have to put my same face up and accept we were not as good as we expected.” Spurs have won only three of 10 matches in all competitions this season and, joint-bottom of Champions League Group B with Olympiakos, they face an uphill battle to qualify for the last 16 with back-to-back games against Red Star Belgrade up next. “It’s difficult to talk now,” Pochettino said. “I said nothing [to the players]. It’s a situation where we have to be calm first. We will talk tomorrow. We are not going to fix anything by shouting; when the emotion is on the skin. It’s more psychological now. To try to move on and no damage between us. “To be honest, after 30 minutes or the first half, it was my best feeling managing the team this season. It is so difficult to accept how the feeling changed in the second half. Nobody in that stadium expected this type of result in the end. It was a little bit of a strange game.” Jan Vertonghen said the players felt ashamed and embarrassed. “It was a painful night for us,” the defender said. “They punished us with every single mistake we made and we let the fans and everyone at the club down with this result. “Bad. Everyone is ashamed of this result. There’s not too much I can say about this … I feel extremely hurt. All negative words. It is embarrassing. It is a very bad result.”
2	The contrasting fortunes of two British racecourses were revealed by almost simultaneous announcements on Tuesday, when one deal was done to secure the future of Musselburgh while another has almost certainly ended racing at Towcester. There was little surprise at the news that Towcester’s final 10 fixtures had been sold off – no white knight having emerged to save the business since it went into administration more than a year ago – but there was much dismay. The Northamptonshire track was well known for its stiff, uphill finish and its stamina-sapping surface, which produced some of the most thrilling and prolonged finishes in jump racing. The Gold Cup and Grand National-winning trainer Kim Bailey tweeted the news was “a huge disaster for slow horses” and suggested the land might now be sold for housing. Towcester’s management had sold off its better fixtures while the track was still in business, so the action there rarely generated headline news. An exception was the day that Sir Anthony McCoy rode his 4,000th winner in front of a crowd of rare size and enthusiasm. ARC revealed that it had bought Towcester’s fixtures and will now distribute them among its 16 tracks. The British Horseracing Authority expressed sadness at the news and insisted that the fixtures would still have to be used for jump racing. At Musselburgh, however, things are looking up after the contract to run the track east of Edinburgh was awarded to the company that runs Chester and Bangor. A successful track after many years of profits being reinvested, Musselburgh had become the subject of a power struggle between the local authority and those appointed to oversee the business, which is now hoped to be a thing of the past. Meanwhile, the field for Sunday’s Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe is likely to be the smallest for at least a dozen years, following four withdrawals on Tuesday. Mehdaayih, Musis Amica, Silverwave and Matchwinner were taken out, leaving just 12 in the race, although the French-trained Soft Light is expected to be a supplementary entry on Wednesday at a cost of €120,000. Bookmakers introduced him as a 66-1 shot. Wednesday’s best bets Nottingham has passed an inspection this morning but the heavy going is going to present a serious test for the Flat racers there this afternoon and it seems non-runners will be in plentiful supply. It’s not a tempting card for me but 9-1 seems fair enough about Ugo Gregory (3.25), who is drifting back out after early support from the opening 11-1. A Tim Easterby-trained three-year-old sprinter, Ugo Gregory finished strongly to score twice over this course and distance in August. He was then well held when sent to Carlisle for a third race in the space of 15 days but has been given a useful break since then and will be fresher than most of these rivals, though there are 16 of them. It’s officially “good” at Huntingdon but the amount of recent rainfall there suggests it might ride a bit slower. The two Jonjos could be in for a good day and there’s no denying they’re in form, with four winners from their 10 runners together in the past fortnight. Their progressive mare Phoenix Rock (3.10) has gone up 10lb for a Worcester win but she had plenty in hand that day and another good showing is on the cards at 3-1. The recent form of Global Anchor (4.10) has not been so good but this is only his third run in handicaps and his first with Jonjo Jr aboard. His July effort at Newton Abbot hinted at better to come, blinkers should help and he’s attracting interest at 7-1. Then there’s Transpennine Star (4.40) in the staying handicap hurdle. He showed a good attitude to score on his reappearance at Hexham and has only been raised 3lb. There is a bit more to come from this 7-2 shot. The market doesn’t want to know about Atalanta Breeze (7.40) and indeed the tight turns of Kempton will not be ideal for her. But she was green as anything when winning at Brighton last month and I’m sure she’s ahead of her rating, if she can race more professionally, so the 9-2 is acceptable.
3	Louis Vuitton, the world’s biggest luxury brand, closed Paris fashion week with a collection steeped in sentimental affection for the city’s belle époque era of 1871 to 1914. If fashion channels the mood of the times, it is striking when a house whose exclusive logo-stamped luggage has made it a global byword for aspirational living declares the past a more appealing reference than the future. Especially when the designer is Nicolas Ghesquière, whose mood boards are usually a blend of science fiction costumes, Japanese anime motifs and landmarks of modernist architecture. The collection was a love letter to a postcard version of Paris: the age of Folies Bergère and the Eiffel Tower, curlicued lamps on the banks of the Seine and art nouveau metro signs. Ghesquière said he wanted to explore “dandyism, and those particular snobberies that would later become what is known as French elegance”. The clothes channelled the mood music of Paris at its most charming, rather than being literal in their retro-reference. Ghesquière’s futuristic clothes tend to be what is referred to politely, in fashion-speak, as “costume-adjacent”, but this collection was extremely wearable and immediately desirable. High-waisted, wide-legged trousers were worn with silk blouses layered under tailored blazers. Belted trench coats and clean-lined shifts were worn with block-heeled loafers or moccasins. Handbags were timelessly elegant – and even sensibly sized, rather than minuscule – with graceful top handles. The show took place in a courtyard of the Louvre, where a vast video screen showed Scottish musician Sophie, who chooses not to disclose a gender identity, performing It’s Okay to Cry, a song described in a Guardian review as “a power ballad about an identity-based struggle … hideous and heartrending, an overacted meditation on self-acceptance that could easily prompt real tears”. In a blockbuster commercial evening, this was the only nod to the alternative aesthetic leanings for which Ghesquière is usually known. Louis Vuitton was valued in May at $39.3bn (£32bn), putting it well ahead of Chanel, its closest competitor – and it is getting bigger. This year, the brand has had a series of major perfume launches, while ambitious plans for a greater slice of the “hard luxury” market, in watches and fine jewellery, are next.
4	Hillary Clinton has said the “gutsiest” thing she’s ever done was to “make the decision to stay in my marriage” to Bill Clinton. Speaking to ABC’s Good Morning America on Tuesday to promote a book she wrote with her daughter, Chelsea, The Book of Gutsy Women, the 2016 Democratic presidential candidate was asked about the gutsiest thing she had ever done. “Personally, make the decision to stay in my marriage,” she said, without elaborating. “Publicly, politically, run for president. And keep going. Just get up every day and keep going.” Chelsea Clinton said she was “overwhelmed” by her mother’s answer. Bill Clinton survived impeachment in the late 1990s over his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Hillary Clinton, then first lady, stood by her husband. She lost the presidency to Donald Trump in 2016 despite winning the popular vote. Hillary Clinton has been on the media circuit for the last few days promoting the book, and has been vocal about the impeachment inquiry into Trump. She said that she supports Nancy Pelosi’s decision to start an impeachment inquiry. On the Late Show with Stephen Colbert on Tuesday, Clinton said an impeachment inquiry is now “exactly what should be done”. The Ukraine scandal has had “such a huge impact because we’ve known for a long time that he was a corrupt businessman who cheated people,” Clinton told Colbert. “To see him in the office of the president putting his personal and political interests ahead of the national security of our country just pierced through whatever confusion and denial people had.” Clinton repeated her stance on Good Morning America, saying she does not have any concerns about the inquiry because the evidence concerning the Ukraine scandal is so “dramatic and irrefutable”.
5	The Labor frontbencher Andrew Giles says the inevitable postmortem from the 2019 election needs to be broader than examining whether the electoral system is delivering for voters. It also needs to consider questions of accountability and trust. Giles, the opposition spokesman on cities and urban infrastructure and a former deputy chair of the joint standing committee on electoral matters, told a seminar at the University of Melbourne that policy agendas meant little to voters in 2019 “if no one believes it could ever be delivered”. “What’s the point, fundamentally, of all our campaigning if it’s met with a resigned cynicism at best, or outright rejection at worst,” Giles said. “We need to think about who’s participating, and how. We need to think about whether all Australians’ concerns are reflected and represented. We need to think about who’s not involved – whether by choice or by having been excluded.” The challenge was not so much executing a technical review but arriving at an understanding of why people were alienated from the system: “I believe that the challenge is to reinforce and rebuild electoral and political institutions which support trust and confidence in our democracy.” His comments come as the joint standing committee on electoral matters is inquiring into the conduct of the election, and Labor has urged the committee to investigate specifically whether the digital behemoths are having a negative impact on Australian democracy after Facebook refused to take down fake news about the “death tax” circulating during the May election campaign. He hoped the committee could make useful suggestions at the end of its inquiry if it was prepared to ask the right questions, and said that during the last parliament it managed “to reach significant agreements on a multi-partisan basis”. But fixing deficiencies in the system required politicians to understand trust and confidence was waning in democracies around the world, including Australia, for a range of reasons. “Our accountability framework simply isn’t what it should be,” he said. “The very notion of a truly independent public service providing frank and fearless advice to government is under siege. Our freedom of information laws have become something close to a joke. “In this age of big data, it’s getting harder and harder to obtain information about government decision-making. On a closely related note, the other declining institution we need to think about is the news media.” There had been considerable attention in recent weeks on press freedom, he said. “Threats to press freedom and the public’s right to know are critical, but [are] only part of the problem,” he said. “Our democracy rests on shared understandings – being able to share in a national conversation. I’m worried that the fragmentation of our traditional media, the pressures on journalists and the practice of journalism, as well as the encroachment of the social media giants, has eroded our capacity to carry on this conversation. “Curated news consumption narrows our understanding of the world, and diminishes our capacity to engage in meaningful debate. Without restoring a genuine national conversation, I fear any other reforms to our electoral or political institutions may prove worthless”. He hoped the committee would look at nuts and bolts, like recommending real-time disclosure of donations with an appropriate disclosure limit of $1,000, and consider expenditure caps. “The extraordinary role of Clive Palmer in May’s election demands a response,” he said. “A billionaire spending $60m is a powerful reminder that the problem isn’t just about party fundraising and disclosure. It’s about dealing with an understanding that our politics can be purchased.” Giles said the other side of that coin was “the sense of alienation felt by too many Australians”. “Let’s think about those not enrolled to vote, those who didn’t vote, and those whose ballots reflected frustration not inspiration,” he said. “Let’s not lose sight of the main game here: restoring confidence in the possibilities of Australian politics [and] developing and committing to an institutional framework that we can all have faith in.”
6	More than 200,000 people aged 60 to 74 suffered domestic abuse in England and Wales in one year, according to new figures from Age UK, which warned that the total could be higher due to unrecorded abuse. The charity revealed that one in four victims of recorded domestic homicides were over the age of 60. It said it feared for the safety of thousands more due to people’s reluctance or inability to report abuse by loved ones or carers. The National Crime Survey does not record data for people over the age of 74, so many older people were not included in the figures, Age UK said. “There’s a widespread misconception that domestic abuse only happens to younger people but sadly hundreds of thousands of older people are affected, too,” said Caroline Abrahams, Age UK’s charity director. “It’s high time that this was fully recognised by the law, policy and practice so that the needs of older survivors can be identified and properly met.” The report is being launched on the same day that the domestic abuse bill will receive its second reading in parliament. In their report, Age UK calls for the final version of the bill, that will form part of the Queen’s speech, to include the views and needs of older people. In 2018-19, Age UK said it received 655 enquiries relating to domestic abuse via its advice line. National data for 2017 shows that more than 200,000 people aged 60 to 74 experienced domestic abuse in England and Wales. Using data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales, Age UK found that two in three older victims of domestic violence were female and four in five perpetrators were male. Older people were almost equally likely to be killed by a partner or spouse as they were by their adult children or grandchildren. Laura, 81, has endured abuse by her husband, Henry – not their real names – throughout their marriage. “Fifty seven years of marriage. People say: ‘Congratulations, what an achievement!’ If only they knew,” she said. “His memory has started to fail now and he gets frustrated and angr. Thankfully, problems with his hip mean he can’t manage the stairs anymore so he sleeps downstairs and allows me to sleep upstairs. Night-time is my favourite part of the day. I can rest knowing he can’t get to me and feel safe for the first time in years. I lie in bed and my thoughts are completely my own.” The report, which is backed by the Women’s Aid Foundation, said older survivors of domestic abuse could face significant barriers when asking for help or when trying to leave an abusive relationship. “These barriers can be severe for survivors who have been subject to years of prolonged abuse, are isolated within a particular community through language or culture, are experiencing long-term health impacts or disabilities, or those who are reliant on their abuser for their care or money,” Abrahams said. Adina Claire, the acting co-chief executive of Women’s Aid, said: “Domestic abuse can happen to any woman, regardless of age. We know, however, that some older women might not recognise their experience as domestic abuse or may find it difficult to ask for help because they are dependent on their abuser. “We welcome Age UK‘s recommendations for the Domestic abuse bill, such as collecting data on all ages and embedding policy and practice across health and social care which will transform the support provided to older survivors, improving and saving lives. It is vital that their needs are considered in this legislation.” Prior to 2017, the crime survey only asked people up to 59-years-old if they were experiencing domestic violence. The Home Office said that age limit wasn’t removed completely because “testing showed the proportion of people [answering the question] decreased significantly for those aged 75 and over”. A Home Office spokesperson said: “This government is committed to tackling violence against older people. Like other forms of abuse, attacks on older people are all too often hidden behind closed doors and so tackling it requires a collective effort. “We have appointed a designate Domestic Abuse Commissioner to provide public leadership on domestic abuse issues and play a key role in overseeing and monitoring provision of domestic abuse services in England and Wales.”
7	A Burger King tweet has been banned by the advertising watchdog for condoning antisocial behaviour and encouraging political protesters to “milkshake” the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage. In May, a day after it emerged that a McDonald’s restaurant in Edinburgh had been asked by police not to sell milkshakes because it was located within 200 metres of where Farage was to hold a rally and protesters might throw them, Burger King tweeted: “Dear people of Scotland. We’re selling milkshakes all weekend. Have fun. Love BK. #justsaying”. Farage had previously been hit by a milkshake in Newcastle city centre, after a spate of similar incidents against far-right candidates in the European elections campaign, a form of protest known as “milkshaking”. Farage was scheduled to make more public appearances in Scotland following the Burger King tweet. The Advertising Standards Authority launched an investigation into whether the tweet broke UK advertising rules and should be banned, after it received 24 complaints that it was irresponsible and offensive because it encouraged violence and antisocial behaviour. “We considered that the [tweet] was likely to be seen as a reference to the recent incidents of ‘milkshaking’ political figures,” said the ASA. “We considered it would be understood as suggesting that Burger King milkshakes could be used by people to ‘milkshake’ Nigel Farage.” Burger King UK, which has almost 50,000 Twitter followers, was criticised at the time for inciting violence. It posted a follow-up tweet that said: “We’d never endorse violence – or wasting delicious milkshakes! So enjoy the weekend and please drink responsibly people.” The burger chain said the tweet was meant to be a “tongue-in-cheek reaction” to recent events where milkshakes had been thrown at political figures. The ASA disagreed and said the tweet broke UK advertising rules governing social responsibility and harm and offence. “We considered that the ad condoned the previous antisocial behaviour and encouraged further instances,” the ASA said. “We therefore concluded the ad was irresponsible. We told Burger King to ensure that its future marketing communications did not condone or encourage antisocial behaviour.”

10	For those who believe that white privilege is a myth, a new study on the Harvard admissions process may debunk that. After Students for Fair Admissions took Harvard to court for allegedly discriminating against Asian Americans in a high-profile case last year, researchers – including one expert involved in the lawsuit – have examined some of the documents made publicly available from that case. On Tuesday the judge in the case ruled that Harvard’s admissions policy, though not perfect, did not violate the constitution. The research shines a light on the elusive selection of students who are either related to staff and donors or on the dean’s interest list (usually referred to as “legacy students”), or athletes. These students are accepted at a higher rate than other applicants, even though they have worse grades. They also tend to be overwhelmingly white: roughly a third of legacy students are African American, Hispanic or Asian American. Being selected as a legacy student in itself is an advantage: these applications are closely monitored by staff at Harvard, perhaps the reason why they are about 20 times more likely to be interviewed. And of course, being interviewed means you’re more likely to get in. As such, all legacy students are advantaged in comparison to their peers, regardless of race. For example, students who apply as athletes are 14 times more likely to be accepted to Harvard, and those who are related to a member of staff are seven times more likely to get in. But this advantage plays out differently for white and non-white students. Taking into consideration factors such as the grades and extra-curricular activities of legacies and athlete students, the researchers estimate that roughly three-quarters of white legacy students would have been rejected if they had been treated the same as white non-legacy students. Forty-three per cent of white students admitted to Harvard were recruited as athletes, legacy students or the children of faculty or of major donors, the study found. Another interesting finding from the paper is that, while people may think of Harvard as an academic institution first and foremost, a high proportion of its students are athletes: 34%. The researchers conclude that getting rid of the preferential treatment of athletes and legacy students would “significantly alter the racial distribution of admitted students, with the share of white admits falling and all other groups rising or remaining unchanged”. • This article was amended on 2 October 2019. A reference to “non-white legacy students” has been corrected to “white legacy students”.
11	Things fall apart. The centre cannot hold. Neither can the left flank. Or the right. Or the heart of midfield come to think of it. On a rain-sodden night in north London Bayern Munich simply ran away with this game, scoring five times in 34 second-half minutes as the Tottenham defence collapsed like an overly dunked digestive. What’s worse than losing 7-2 at home to Bayern Munich in the style of late-Wenger Arsenal? Losing 7-2 to Bayern Munich in the style of late-Wenger Arsenal when a late-Wenger Arsenal player scores four of the goals. Serge Gnabry will take the headlines. He was impishly irresistible in that final half-hour, doing terrible things to the right side of the Spurs back four, feet barely seeming to dent the turf, repeatedly planting the ball in the corner of Hugo Lloris’s goal. But this was a strange game too. Tottenham had actually taken the lead with 12 minutes gone. They kept the score at 1-1 right up to the final moments before half-time, Moussa Sissoko and Tanguy Ndombele combining to take a high-energy grip of midfield. At which point: enter Lewy. For all Gnabry’s brilliance, it was Robert Lewandowski who provided the game’s decisive moment of incision. It was the goal of a genuine killer too, a moment that seemed to suck the air out of the stadium as the ball rippled and span and gurgled around in the corner of the net It wasn’t the power of the shot, or some outrageous moment of highlights-reel skill. It was the way Lewandowski had seen, moved, turned, shot and even begun to celebrate his goal before the players around him had time to process what was about to happen. Instead the white shirts saw a scramble at the edge of the box. There were collisions, tackles, a jockeying away from goal. The ball squirted into space. Corentin Tolisso, already lying on the grass appealing for a foul, hooked a leg at it. And then Lewandowski moved, taking two sniping steps back, wrapping a leg around the ball in the tiniest of spaces and spanking it back hard and low into the corner. It was his 13th touch of the ball, right on half time. Three of those had been shots at goal. Six were completed passes. In between Lewandowski had contented himself with walking through his carefully defined territories around the box. And he does move in an extraordinary way. This is a man who slinks, who sidles, who meanders with the easy grace of a genuine athlete. For a while at Bayern his nickname was “The Body”, a dressing-room tribute to his muscle tone, his regal air, perhaps even the sense of a cold-eyed serial sniper at work. If there is a criticism of Lewandowski it is that his game has been pared back, that he has become a refined, high-functioning machine, running through the same deadly patterns on the same patch of ground. At times Lewandowski tends to lurk like a ghost through the wall, getting closer, appearing in unexpected spaces, eventually materialising at the centre of things. “I can win games on my own,” he said earlier this season, the implication being that he really shouldn’t have to, but he does. The goals here – the second a sublime, agreeably imperious steer into the corner as Tottenham collapsed around him – was his 14th in 10 games for Bayern. Lewandowski does this. Every now and then he becomes, for a while, undeniably the best centre-forward in the world. He had a brilliant run under Pep Guardiola exactly four years ago, racking up 13 goals in six games and adding another layer of attacking possibility under a manager whose style might have been at odds with the Lewandowski lone-gun persona. By now, aged 31, Lewandowski seems like a monument: immovable, unsmiling, fixated on his own returns. He was top scorer in the Polish third division 13 years ago. Right now he has 204 goals in 252 games for Bayern and has become a constant in this team; a link, just about, to that great Jupp Heynckes era, albeit he was playing for the other side at Wembley the last time they were champions of Europe. Lewandowski didn’t have to win this game on his own. Gnabry took up the slack. Joshua Kimmich was irresistible in midfield and then on the right flank. This was a team clicking into a gear in real time, and led by that enduring rapier. Niko Kovac had described Lewandowski and Harry Kane as the “best in the world” before this game, and it is a fascinating comparison. These are rare footballers, the pure centre-forward in a time of ever more diverse and shifting roles. Kane scored Tottenham’s second here from the spot, played well enough for 50 minutes, and after that watched as the structures behind him fell apart – led by that moment from Lewandowski.
12	Boris Johnson’s hopes of entering into intensive and decisive Brexit negotiations next week could be dashed after he was sharply criticised in Dublin, Paris and Berlin for signalling plans for the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland. The prime minister is expected to set out his long-awaited proposals for the Irish border in his speech at Conservative party conference in Manchester on Wednesday, outlining what he will call “a fair and reasonable compromise” but warning that if the EU27 does not engage, he will press ahead with no deal. Johnson confirmed on Tuesday that his plans would include a customs border on the island of Ireland but insisted the proposals would show that the new regime of checks and controls would be light-touch. The plan would also involve Northern Ireland staying under EU single market regulations for agrifood and manufactured goods for four years, leaving it in a special relationship with the bloc until at least 2025. Stormont will at that point decide whether to continue alignment with EU standards on manufactured goods or follow UK rules as the country diverges. But the plans in which Northern Ireland would have two borders for a four-year period are set to receive a frosty welcome when they are formally published on Wednesday. If the UK had accepted the need for Northern Ireland to temporarily stay under both single market regulations and in a shared customs territory with the EU after Brexit, sources in Brussels disclosed to the Guardian that pressure might have been applied on Dublin to accept a time limit, an unthinkable concession just six months ago, and one yet to be discussed among the EU27. But officials and diplomats said the current “kamikaze” approach taken by Downing Street to the customs border offered no way forward and Johnson’s hopes of finding an agreement would be swiftly dashed. “I expect Mr Barnier [the EU chief negotiator] will make it clear very quickly that this does not stack up,” said one EU diplomat. With little over two weeks before the crunch EU leaders’ summit at which Johnson hopes to sign off on a deal, Downing Street is banking on then entering secretive “tunnel” negotiations to hammer out the details of an agreement. Johnson’s predecessor at No 10, Theresa May, had secured an all-UK customs element to the backstop following such a period of talks in 2018, during which the European commission’s negotiators took risks over the unity of the EU27 in order to find a deal that could be put to parliament. When that deal emerged from the secret talks, a number of member states, including France, were unhappy with the outcome but allowed it to pass, having been convinced it was the only deal the Commons could accept. But the UK’s current direction of travel, including an insistence on the return of a customs border on the island of Ireland, offered little room for negotiation, EU diplomats said. “I haven’t seen a tunnel and I have never even seen the signs of heading to a tunnel,” said one EU diplomat. “Please put on your lights. I think it is a bit premature.” Speaking to the media on Tuesday, Johnson denied reports that his first formal proposals to the EU would involve customs clearance sites five to 10 miles from the border to the north and the south to deal with imports and exports. The prime minister reiterated, however, that Northern Ireland could not be left in the EU’s customs territory after Brexit and said it was simply a “reality” that there would need to be extra checks and controls on the island of Ireland. Speaking in the Irish parliament, the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, welcomed the fact that Johnson had “disowned” the reported contents of the “non-papers” discussion documents submitted by the UK to the European commission but fired a shot across the prime minister’s bows. “I’m conscious when answering your question that I am talking about non-papers that I haven’t seen,” Varadkar told the Irish parliament. He added: “I very much welcome Boris Johnson’s words today when he disowned the non-papers. Had he not, in my view it would be hard evidence of bad faith by the UK government. “The UK government promised no hard border or associated controls or checks and we expect the British government to honour that promise made in the withdrawal agreement. People here don’t want a customs border between north and south and no British government should seek to impose customs posts against the will of the people on the island of Ireland.” The chair of the Bundestag’s foreign affairs committee, Norbert Röttgen, who is in the same party as the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, tweeted: “Johnson simply doesn’t learn: his latest Brexit plans are not serious and violate the law. He wants to ask not to extend the deadline and proposes a backstop that de facto is a hard border. Not least to protect the sovereignty of parliament. EU should give a long extension.” In a sign of widespread dismay at the British government’s choices, France’s foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said a no-deal Brexit was now the most likely outcome. He said: “You know France’s position. It considers that the withdrawal agreement is the best solution. But today the most plausible scenario is an exit without a deal.”
13	Seriously, what another dramatic day in Doha. A brilliant pole vault final, a last gasp winning throw in the women’s javelin, a championship record from Donavan Brazier and then an edgy Noah Lyles had to battle from behind to win his 200 metres title. The more the latter final is replayed, the more it seems like Gemili’s early lead may have just spooked Lyles a little and he had to react. Nobody saw that coming. Gemili couldn’t hang on for his first global medal, but we should all bookmark this moment and prepare to look back after Tokyo 2020 or Oregon in 2021. This could be a defining moment for Gemili after years of injuries. That’s all from me today. Until tomorrow. Here is Sean Ingle’s report from another lively day in Doha. Here is a sobering read from Sean Ingle on Alberto Salazar’s four year ban and the fallout for UK Athletics and Mo Farah. Michael Johnson on the BBC thought that Gemili did a far better job than he gave himself credit for: I don’t think his perspective right now is really clear on the race and what he would have had to do to get among the medals. I think that he felt like, ‘Well, I’m in really good shape, I’m finally healthy and I’m starting to come back so that means that I feel like I should get a medal because I did everything I needed to do and I’m healthy and I’m back.’ But, at the end of the day, when you look at the times, he ran 20.03. He matched his season best. His personal best is 19.97. So, for him to say, ‘I didn’t even get under 20 seconds?’ Well, he’s only been slightly under 20 seconds before so he would have had to run a personal best. Quinonez won in 19.98, his personal best is 19.97. I think that when he goes back and looks at this, he’ll think: ‘I was really close.’ Those guys just ran really really well in comparison to him, his personal best and his capabilities, and he’ll see in that race that his form didn’t really fall apart at the end. A heartbroken Adam Gemili was close to tears in his BBC interview: I’m just gutted. I just had it. I had it. I gave it everything. I lost all my bounce at the end. I had nothing left. All my form went out the window and I ran like such an amateur. Ah, I can’t believe that I came so close. This was such a good opportunity. I’ve been running so well through the heats. My body feels good and I just let it go when I had it and I’m so sorry. People always say ‘don’t apologise’ but I just feel like I have let so many people down. There’s so many people that have believed in me and sent me such nice messages over the past few days. The team that I’ve worked with have done so well. The last few years, I’ve been plagued by injuries and my performances have shown it. And I’ve got back to where I should be and to not be able to break 20 seconds is so disappointing and heartbreaking. I had the medal and it slipped out of my hands. I have to take the positives, I guess, from being written off pretty much, labeled a ‘relay runner’ or whatever. It just shows that you just need that tight-knit group of people around you and you can achieve whatever you wanna achieve. For me, that hasn’t happened today but it has relit something inside of me. Tokyo next year, it’s winnable. I’ll have to go away and reset. I have a couple of days until the heats. I’m fit and healthy. Hopefully I’ll be in the team and there will be a bit of redemption just like 2017. This is such a bad interview because I’m just gutted. That was tough. Gemili flitted out of the blocks and was actually leading until about 120 metres. For once, Lyles did not look as comfortable as in previous races, but he remained calm and pulled through into the lead. With a medal in his sights, Gemili’s form began to fall apart in the final 40 metres and he watched as both De Grasse and Quinonez pass him. That was definitely not what anyone was expecting. De Grasse takes silver in 19.95, Quinonez 19.98. Gemili, who was in second for much of the race, pipped at the end. He takes 4th. It’s time for the men’s 200 metres final. Noah Lyles of the United States has run far faster than the rest of the world today with a world leading time of 19.50. We’ll see if the likes of Andre De Grasse and Ramil Guliyev can stay with him, and if Adam Gemili can secure a surprising medal. But first, it’s time for the lights show... In the women’s javelin, Kelsey-Lee Barber of Australia snatches a stunning gold medal with a winning throw of 66.56 on her final attempt. Shiying Liu and Huihui Lyu of China settle for silver and bronze. Lyu had won 12 successive meets coming into Doha, but you have to perform when it truly matters. Sam Kendricks wins the pole vault world title. 19 year-old Armand Duplantis fails to clear 5.97, handing Kendricks the win with one fewer foul. As the pair hug and then exhaustedly collapse onto the mat, bronze medalist Piotr Lisek joins them before they all backflip in unison. Lovely stuff. Donavan Brazier destroys the field to win in 1:42.34 with a championship record and a national record. That was a tough, tough race, with Wesley Vazquez taking the lead and trying to win the race from the front. But as the Puerto Rican tied up, Brazier roared through the final 200 metres. Amel Tuka takes second place in 1:43.47, over a second slower. Ferguson Cheruiyot Rotich takes third. It’s time for the men’s 800m final. Donavan Brazier of the United States starts as favourite and Kenya’s Ferguson Cheruiyot Rotich as the world leader. However, this is a pretty open race. Sam Kendricks clears 5.97 at the final attempt! His teammate Cole Walsh sprints back onto the runway to hug and yell at the world leader some more. If his cheerleading continues, Walsh may just deserve a fraction of Kendrick’s winnings for his help. Breathtaking scenes in the men’s pole vault as Duplantis clears 5.97 at the final try. He just brushed the bar on his way down. It shook, but it stays. Huge. This child is 19 years old. The favourite Sam Kendricks is down to his final jump. That was easy and brilliant from Dina Asher-Smith. She absolute destroyed the field from the beginning, tearing around the bend to establish her lead in the first 100m and then relaxing to the end. Her time of 22.16 was .30 faster than the rest of the field and it looks like there is much more to come. Then she even helped Anthonique Strachan, who seems to have badly hurt her knee, off the track. Dina Asher-Smith eases into the final, winning her semi-final in 22.16. It’s time for Dina Asher-Smith. The 100 metres silver medalist is on the track for the third 200 metres semi-final. There aren’t many threats in her race. She just has to keep her head. Back in the, men’s pole vault final, the drama continues. Sam Kendricks of the United States turns the tables on his foes by immediately clearing 5.92. Duplantis of Sweden fouls twice, Poland’s Lisek fouls once and then passes for the next height. On his final attempt at 5.92, 19 year-old Duplantis clears. Phew. In the second women’s 200m semi-final, USA’s Brittany Brown takes the win in 22.46. Tyina Gaither of the Bahamas snatches the second automatic spot in 22.57. Meanwhile in the men’s pole vault, Sam Kendricks barely survived 5.87m, clearing it at the final attempt. His countryman Cole Walsh, who departed at 5.70, began screaming at him in excitement. Kendricks cracks a smile, and perhaps he just relaxed. Onto 5.92. Anglerne Annelus wins the first 200 metres semi-final with a time of 22.49. Not exactly a stunning time, but it’s enough. A good run from Mujinga Kambundji of Switzerland too, who missed the 100m final by a thousandth of a second. The women’s 200 metres sprinters are on the tracks. Britain’s Jodie Williams has had a great year and she is in with a chance of making a global final. Let’s see what she looks like under world championships pressure. Elaine Thompson has withdrawn from the women’s 200m semi-finals. Thompson has been struggling with her achilles and hasn’t been able to give her best at this event. More opportunities for the rest of the field... Some drama in the men’s pole vault at last. After clean cards for all three of them, Duplantis, Lisek and favourite Kendricks all fail to clear their first attempts at 5.80. 19 year-old Duplantis of Sweden clears at his second attempt. The pressure is now firmly on the other two. We have our three men’s pole vault medalists, and all three haven’t missed a single jump yet. Now, let’s see who wins. Well, that was dramatic. Stephenie Ann Mcpherson wins the third semi-final in 50.70. Both Shakima Wimbley and Galefele Moroko failed to finish the race, with the latter taken off the track in a wheelchair. Sprinting for 400 metres is tough! A solid run from Britain’s Emily Diamond, who recorded a 51.62 season best. There is some more British interest in the final women’s 400 metres semi-final. Emily Diamond will be running from lane two. Tough ask for her to make the final, but you never know... Shaunae Miller-Uibo stamps her mark on the competition with an easy 49.66 to win the second 400 metres semi-final. Jamaica’s Shericka Jackson streamed through the opening 300 metres, but the favourite ran her own race and breezed past in the final 100m. Jackson was also passed by the talented young American Wadeline Jonathas on the line, who secured a personal best of 50.07 after starting the year having run no faster than 52.8. In the women’s 400m semi-finals, Salwa Eid Naser makes a very clear statement by tearing through the field in 49.79 seconds. Only one other sprinter, defending champion Phyllis Francis (50.22), finished under 51 seconds. A tough, tough race for Britain’s Laviai Nielsen, who finished last in 52.94. The pole vaulters are now up to 5.70. Sam Kendricks just flew high over the bar, a terrifying sight for his rivals. Thiago Braz also seems to have recovered from his first round mishap. But 15 centimetres is a big progression and only six men passed at the first opportunity. We begin with the men’s pole vault final. Sam Kendricks is the favourite and the vaulters are starting at 5.55m. That is fairly low by their extremely high standards, but not for Olympic champion Thiago Braz who fails at the first jump. That may prove costly. Please do also check out Sean Ingle’s complete report from last night. Terrifying. Of course, the big news today comes off the track. Alberto Salazar, former coach of Mo Farah who oversaw Sifan Hassan’s 10,000m win earlier this week, has been banned for four years for doping offences. Hello! Welcome to day 5 of the athletics world championships in Doha, where we will have four finals this evening. We begin with the men’s pole vault final, and Sam Kendricks of the United States will look to dominate the field after his monstrous best of 6.06 this year. In the women’s javelin final, China’s Lyu Huihui has won her last 12 competitions and will be looking for one more. On the track, the women will only be contesting semi-finals. Shaunae Miller-Uibo of The Bahamas is the heavy favourite to win the women’s 400 metres but Bahrain’s Salwa Eid Naser will be hoping to make a statement as they prepare for a final showdown. Of course, the women’s 200 metres semi-finals will include the woman of the moment Dina Asher-Smith. In a field that is slightly weaker than expected, there is no doubt that she is the gold medal favourite. Day 5 will conclude with two men’s finals on the tracks. In the 800 metres, Donavan Brazier of the United States will be the man to beat. And then we will conclude with the men’s 200 metres final. With a world lead of 19.50 seconds, Noah Lyles of the United States has been miles ahead of the field this year. Andre De Grasse, Ramil Guliyev and co. will be looking to rein him in. Can Adam Gemili spring a surprise and land an unexpected first individual world medal? Time will tell. As always, please do send any questions/abuse to me at @tumcarayol or tumaini.carayol@theguardian.com.
14	A former police officer who argued she had a right to use lethal force when she killed an innocent man after mistakenly entering his apartment has been convicted of murder. Amber Guyger faces a lengthy prison sentence after a jury found her guilty of the murder of Botham Jean in Dallas on 6 September last year – a verdict Jean family attorneys hailed as a significant moment in the battle to hold police accountable. Guyger is white. Jean was black. Guyger is the first Dallas police department officer to be convicted of murder since the 1970s, the Dallas Morning News reported. Standing in a packed hallway outside the courtroom in Dallas, attorney Lee Merritt told reporters the ruling was “a huge victory not only for the family of Botham Jean, but as his mother, Allison, told us a moment ago, this is a victory for black people in America”. He said: “It is a signal that the tide is going to change here, [that] police officers are going to be held accountable for their actions.” Merritt said the community should not have had to wait “on pins and needles” for the conviction of someone who killed a man who was “completely non-aggressive, sitting at home eating a bowl of ice cream and someone barged into his home and shot him to death.” He added: “This should have been automatic, anticipated, expected, but it is extremely rare. From this day forward we are pushing so that it’s not rare.” The jury began deliberating on Monday afternoon and reached a verdict on Tuesday morning, with sentencing to follow. Guyger pleaded not guilty. In Texas, murder usually carries a sentence of five to 99 years in prison but Judge Tammy Kemp had allowed the jury to consider convicting the lesser charge of manslaughter. Jurors, however, decided that Guyger had committed murder. Ben Crump, a lawyer for the Jean family, told NBC local news, said: “Thank God. Finally America saw the humanity of an unarmed black man who was killed in an unjustifiable way and they returned a verdict that is befitting the criminal, cowardly act of this woman, killing Botham Jean in his own apartment.” Crump added in a press conference: “This is a precedent now that will go forth across America for equal justice for everybody.” He said the incident underscored the need for better police training and that the verdict was for “so many unarmed black and brown human beings all across America” who died in interactions with police. Jean, a 26-year-old accountant, had settled down on his couch to watch television and eat some vanilla ice cream when Guyger entered his home. She claimed she mistakenly believed it was hers and thought he was an intruder. Kemp controversially allowed the jury to consider whether Guyger’s conduct could be justified under Texas’s so-called “castle doctrine”. Expanded in 2007, it is comparable to “stand your ground” laws in other states and allows a civilian to use deadly force if he or she “reasonably believes … [it] is immediately necessary” in certain circumstances, such as during a burglary. Though Jean was on his own property and Guyger the intruder, seemingly inverting the intent of the law, her attorneys argued she made a “mistake of fact” when she went to the wrong home, making her subsequent conduct reasonable. They said she was tired after a long day and many other residents had found themselves at the wrong unit in the past because signage was unclear and floors looked similar. “She made a series of horrible mistakes,” Toby Shook, one of her attorneys, said. “The law recognises that mistakes can be made.” Prosecutors said it was “absurd” to believe the 31-year-old’s “commando-style” behaviour was reasonable, especially given her training as a police officer and status as a more than four-year veteran of the department. They noted that Guyger failed to retreat and call for back-up, questioned the veracity of her claim to have given Jean verbal commands before firing, and pointed out that after calling 911 she appeared to provide only limited medical assistance as Jean, who was from St Lucia, lay dying from a chest wound. Rather than feeling tired, prosecutors alleged, she was distracted because she had been “sexting” a colleague. Jean had a bright red mat in front of his door that ought to have been impossible to miss. Guyger – who was fired by Dallas police – wept while testifying. “I was scared this person inside my apartment was going to kill me,” she said. “I ask God for forgiveness and I hate myself every single day. I feel like a piece of crap.” In closing statements, Jason Fine, a prosecutor, called most of her testimony “garbage”. Fine said Jean did not act in a threatening manner, but started to stand up “like a normal reasonable person who has somebody busting into his home, and before he can even get up he is shot dead in his own home. “Killing this man was unnecessary and unreasonable from start to finish.” Special security measures were put in place during the trial. Jean’s death sparked protests and demands for justice from activists who cited it as one of a long line of racially charged shootings by a police department that lacks accountability. Though she was off duty, Guyger was still in uniform and used her service weapon when she encountered Jean. Critics of the department have also claimed Guyger was given preferential treatment. It emerged during the trial that the head of the Dallas Police Association told another officer to shut off an audio-visual recording system inside a patrol car so that he could have a private conversation with Guyger soon after the shooting. She still faces a civil lawsuit brought by Jean’s family.
15	A federal judge ruled that Harvard University’s undergraduate admissions program is constitutional, rejecting a challenge accusing the school of discrimination against Asian American applicants. In a decision released on Tuesday, US district judge Allison Burroughs in Boston said that while Harvard’s admissions program is not perfect, “the court will not dismantle a very fine admissions program that passes constitutional muster, solely because it could do better”. The case had pitted the Ivy League school against Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA), which opposes affirmative action policies, and whose case was backed by the Trump administration. Supporters of the lawsuit said Harvard illegally discriminated against Asian Americans by putting a cap on the number admitted to the university, making it harder for Asian applicants to get in. Its opponents charged that the case was not about Asian Americans at Harvard; rather, they said it was an issue that has been co-opted by conservative activists whose real goal is ending race-conscious admissions policies that give minority students a better shot at attending universities like Harvard. Supporters on both sides charged the other with racism. Legal experts have said SFFA is likely to appeal, and the case is expected to eventually make its way up to the US supreme court, which would give its five-member conservative majority a chance to bar or more strictly limit the use of affirmative action to help minority applicants get into college. Burroughs ruled nearly a year after holding a non-jury trial. The SFFA group that brought the case accused Harvard of going too far by engaging in “racial balancing” that limited Asian Americans to no more than 20% of its incoming classes. The group, founded by a longtime affirmative action opponent, Edward Blum, argued that while Asian Americans outperformed other groups on academic measures, stereotyping caused them to receive low scores on subjective “personal” ratings. Harvard denied that charge, saying that its use of race in admissions was legal, and was not a factor in the “personal” ratings. The US Department of Justice sided with SFFA, saying Harvard had not seriously considered race-neutral approaches to admissions. It has also investigated whether another Ivy League school, Yale University, also discriminates against Asian Americans.
16	Pep Guardiola speaks: On his substitutions: “Games need everybody, the starting eleven and the people who came from the bench,” he says in an interview with BT Sport. On those missed chances in the first half: “These kind of games are hard because they defend aggressively, one against one,” he says. “It’s always tricky. In the first half we had three or four chances but it was 0-0. We were patient. We scored a good goal in the second half but it was difficult. They were so strong - with 10 players in the box, waiting for a free-kick or a counter-attack from [Bruno] Petkovic.” On Phil Foden’s brief goal-scoring cameo: “I’m so sorry for Phil Foden because he deserves to play more minutes,” he says. “But he’s going to earn his chance.” He refuses to discuss the yellow card he was shown and can’t get away quick enough when the interviewer thanks him for his time. Jamie Jackson was at the Etihad Stadium to see Raheem Sterling and Phil Foden come off the bench to score the goals that did for Dinao Zagreb. while he goes off to hurl interrogatory projectiles at Pep Guardiola, you can read his piping hot take on the final whistle. City go top of the group: City make it two wins from two in Group C, seeing off Dinamo Zagreb with the help of goals from the substitutes Raheem Sterling and Phil Foden. They should have won a game they dominated throughout far more easily, but were guilty of missing a glut of good scoring opportunities in the first half. Hats off to Dinamo Zagreb, who rode their luck at times, but mounted a very impressive rearguard action. Class prevailed in the end, however. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! It’s all over at the Etihad, where Manchester City have beaten Dinamo Zagreb by two goals to no score. Moments before blowing the final whistle, referee Serdar Gozubuyuk brandished his yellow card in the face of Zagreb manager Nenad Bjelica, who was unhappy about something or other. Foden scores! City score from a counter-attack, picking up a pass from Raheem Sterling just inside the Dinamo Zagreb penalty area and rifling a low drive into the bottom left-hand corner. He wheels away in celebration, kissing the crest of his shirt. 90+3 min: Dinamo Zagreb keep plugging away desperate to rescue a point at the end of a game in which they’ve defended stoutly throughout but ridden their luck at times. It took the intervention of Raheem Sterling, who came off the bench shortly before the hour mark to put City ahead in a match they have totally dominated. 90+2 min: Now Dinamo manager Nenad Bjelica is having a very animated discussion with the fourth official. He avoids a yellow card. 90+2 min: Foden gets a touch of the ball, dispossessing Marin Leovac. 90+1 min: Manchester City substitution: Phil Foden on for David Silva. 90 min: Manchester City corner. Next. 88 min: Manchester City substitution: Gabriel Jesus comes on for Sergio Aguero, who looks a bit fed up. He has a word with the referee on his way off, presumably enquiring why he didn’t get a penalty a few minutes ago. 86 min: Sterling holds the ball up in the Dinamo Zagreb penalty area, before playing a pass to the onrushing Mahrez. He tries to sweep it past Livakovic, but the goalkeeper makes another good save. No penalty! The ref elects not to check his sideline monitor and Dinamo Zagreb get away with one there. Stojanovic’s shove on Gundogan was arguably six of one and half a dozen of another, but Peric definitely tripped Aguero. I have no dog in this fight, but that should definitely have been overturned on the grounds of being a clear and obvious error. As we have seen so often in the Premier League, it obviously wasn’t clear and obvious enough for the video assistant referee’s liking. 82 min: Gundogan goes to ground under a shove from Stojanovic, then moments later Aguero goes down after being tripped by Dino Peric. The referee takes time out to consult with his video assistants. 81 min: Gundogan blazes high over the bar when he should have hit the target after running on to a pass from Mahrez. 79 min: In the classic City style, David Silva tries to pick out Sergio Aguero on the edge of the six-yard box with a pull-back from the byline. They’ve scored tons of goals in similar fashion, but this time a defender dives in to intervene. 78 min: Dinamo Zagreb substitution: Mario Gavranovic on for Kevin Theophile-Catherine. City win another corner, from which nothing comes. 75 min: Now Aguero goes down on the edge of the Dinamo Zagreb penalty area, under a challenge from Dilaver. He doesn’t get a free-kick and Pep reacts furiously on the touchline. It’s getting very scrappy – in every sense of the word – at the Etihad. 74 min: Rodri appears to trip Dani Olmo on the edge of the Manchester City penalty area, then gets the hump with the referee for not giving him a free-kick. 72 min: On the touchline, Pep Guardiola shakes his head at the injustice of it all after being shown a yellow card by referee Serdar Gozubuyuk. I can only speculate, but I guess he was voicing his extreme displeasure at the referee’s decision not to award Raheem Sterling the aforementioned penalty or free-kick. He was having a right go at the fourth official, whatever bee was buzzing around his bonnet. 70 min: Raheem Sterling, who has been outstanding since he came on, goes down just outside the left side of the Dinamo Zagreb penalty area under a challenge from Stojanovic. He thinks he should have had a free-kick or penalty, but the ref is not having it. 69 min: Dino Peric is booked for a decidedly agricultural tackle on Riyad Mahrez that leaves the City man wincing with pain once he gets to his feet. 67 min: Relief for City, who finally go ahead. Rodri squared the ball from the left flank and under pressure from a defender on the edge of the six-yard box, Sterling does well to stay on his feet and prod the ball past Livakovic. Raheem Sterling pokes the ball home from six yards out to give Man City a lead that’s been a long time coming. 65 min: Peric slides in to put the ball over his own cross-bar with more last-ditch defending. 64 min: Stojanovic tracks a Sterling run and prevents the City substitute from receiving a pass on the left side of the Dinamo Zagreb penalty area. Good defending - he’s been very impressive this evening, as have most of the visiting defenders. 63 min: Great work from Fernandinho, who wins the ball in the middle third and plays it wide to Sterling. He’s unable to fashion a yard for a shot. 62 min: Dinamo Zagreb substitution: Amer Gojak replaces Mislav Orsic up front. 60 min: We hit the hour mark and it remains goalless. Cancelo tries to pull the ball across the Zagreb penalty area from the byline, but fails to beat the first man. Emir Dilaver intercepts and clears. 58 min: Sterling goes down hurt after a collision with Emir Dilaver as he tried to steer a low Mendy cross goalwards. He got a toe to the ball, despite the defender’s good challenge, but was unable to get too much power on his effort. He’s fit to continue. 57 min: Sterling immediately has an impact, forcing Stojanovic to put the ball out for a corner as he attempts to get on the end of a cross. Nothing comes from the set-piece. 56 min: Manchester City substitution: Raheem Sterling on, Bernardo Silva off. 55 min: Another cross into the Dinamo Zagreb penalty area, this time from Joao Cancelo. Kevin Theophile-Catherine heads clear. 54 min: Raheem Sterling prepared to enter the fray, while his manager tries to gee up his troops from the technical area. He’s looking very animated. 53 min: Stojanovic puts the ball out for a corner after Mendy sends a low cross into the centre. From the ensuing set-piece, the ball is sent high towards the far post. Livakovic punches clear. 51 min: Joao Cancelo gets the better of Marin Leovac on the right side of the Dinamo Zagreb penalty area, twisting his blood before sitting him on his backside. He gets a cross in, but it’s cleared. 49 min: Some panicked defending from Dinamo Zagreb after a mix-up between Dino Peric and his goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic. They get away with it and eventually hack the ball clear. 47 min: Dinamo Zagreb enjoy a rare sortie into Manchester City territory on the counter and find themselves with a three-on-two. Bruno Petkovic dithers excessively on the ball and fails in his attempt to thread the ball towards Mislav Orsic on his left. City clear their lines. 46 min: Manchester City kick-off, with no changes in personnel on either side. They immediately go on the attack again, trying to pass their way through the Dinamo Zagreb defence. It’s all square: Bernardo Silva, David Silva, Sergio Aguero and Riyad Mahrez have missed seven or eight great chances between them as Manchester City dominated the first half at the Etihad. It remains scoreless. 45+2 min: Not for the first, second or third time tonight, Benjamin Mendy fails to beat the first man as he tries to get a cross in from the left. Manchester city are sending everything through him and he’s not really delivering. 45+1 min: We’re into the first of three added minutes. If Zagreb go in for the break without having conceded a goal, they won’t believe their luck. Having said that, City’s chances have dried up in the past 15 minutes, after they missed six or seven great scoring opportunities in the opening half-hour. 45 min: Joao Cancelo turns on the after-burners to take the ball between two defenders in the inside right channel and square the ball. It’s hacked clear by a Dinamo Zagreb defender. 42 min: David Silva appeals for a penalty after taking a tumble in the Dinamo Zagreb penalty area as he ran on to a through ball from Gundogan. Right wing-back Petar Stojanovic had an arm on his shoulder, but didn’t seem to impede his progress - methinks Silva simply lost his balance. Not every fall from a non-foul has to be a dive, you know? 41 min: Mahrez plays the ball out to Mendy on the left touchline. The left-back is being kept busy tonight, tasked as he is with sending one cross after another into the Dinamo Zagreb penalty area. 38 min: Benjamin Mendy sends another cross into the Dinamo Zagreb penalty area, where Riyad Mahrez is penalised for a sly shove on a defender that was spotted by the referee. 37 min: Free-kick for dinamo Zagreb, wide on the right. Marin Leovic curls the ball into the penalty area, where Ederson catches comfortably. 35 min: Kevin Theophile-Catherine, formerly of Cardiff City, dives in to block a low, hard shot-cross from Bernardo Silva on the edge of the six-yard box. He needn’t have bothered - the linesman’s flag was up. 33 min: I’m not quite sure how, but Dinamo have made it past the half-hour mark without conceding. They’re 1,500 travelling fans will be delighted with that, although their team has been exceptionally lucky. With better finishing, Manchester City could be four or five up at this stage. 31 min: Nicolas Otamendi tries to pick out Benjamin Mendy with a ball between defenders down the inside left. It’s intercepted by Petar Stojanovic. 30 min: Mislav Orsic, wearing No99 for Dinamo Zagreb, attempts to ping a pass down the left touchline for Bruno Petkovic to chase. It’s intercepted. 28 min: Another attack by City, with David Silva picking out Sergio Aguero with a wonderfully weighted pass towards the byline. He attempts to drive it across the face of goal, but Livakovic blocks his delivery at his near post. The goalkeeper punches the ball down the pitch from the ensuing corner. 25 min: Bernardo Silva gets the ball in the net for City, but it’s correctly disallowed due to a hand-ball by Sergio Aguero in the build-up. 23 min: Now it’s David Silva’s turn to miss a decent chance. Mendy sends a cross into the penalty area, where Dinamo Zagreb defender Emir Dilaver handles the ball into the path of Silva. He fires wide from seven yards. Referee Serdar Gozbuyuk puts his hand to his ear to receive guidance from his VAR official, but Manchester City don’t get the penalty they perhaps deserved. I say perhaps, because I don’t really understand the hand-ball (Champions League v Premier League versions) rule any more. 22 min: David Silva pulls a cross ino the penalty area. Riyad Mahrez dummies and leaves it to roll into the path of Ilkay Gundogan, who shoots over the bar when he should at least have hit the target. The collective Manchester City cross-hairs don’t seem to be aligned tonight. 20 min: As Olmo gets patched up on the sideline, Mislav Orsic takes the free-kick from wide on the left. He sends a cross fizzing towards the near post, where Ilkay Gundogan heads the ball out for a corner. Nothing comes of it. 19 min: Joao Cancelo gets booked after catching Dani Olmo with a high boot that leaves Dinamo Zagreb’s star player with a nasty cut over his eye. 18 min: Another chance goes begging, as Aguero gets in front of Dino Peric in the Dinamo Zagreb penalty area to receive a pass from Mendy. Having stolen a yard on his marker, he fires high over the bar. 16 min: Having fired over from the follow-up from that Aguero chance, Bernardo Silva once again blazes over the bar with a volley after more good work by City. They’re very much in charge of this game - Zagreb are struggling to get out of their own half. 13 min: Good save from Livakovic, who gets down to safe at the feet of Aguero after the City striker was put clean through on goal. He was helped by a poor first touch from the Argentinian, which made his task slightly easier. It was a good save nonetheless. 12 min: David Silva plays the ball wide to Mendy on the left touchline. He whips it into the mixer, where David Silva is unable to get the ball out from under his feet and fire off a shot. Zagreb clear. 11 min: Rodri overhits a long pass to Sergio Aguero and the ball runs safely into the arms of Livakovic. 10 min: Manchester City build slowly from the back, before David Silva plays the ball wide to Cancelo on the right touchline. His cross his cleared. 9 min: Dinamo Zagreb midfielder Nikolo Moro goes down holding his shin after being caught by a late challenge from Benjamin Mendy. He’ll live. 7 min: Manchester City are dominating in these early stages, as you might expect. Sergio Aguero and Bernardo Silva have a bit of a mix-up, as the former overhits a pass out wide to the latter and watches the ball go wide. Goal-kick for Zagreb, which goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic takes. 5 min: Rodri passes the most perfunctory of on-pitch head injury assessments and is passed fit to continue, despite looking a bit groggy. It’s not ideal, but at some point we can only hope that football will at least start pretending to take potential concussions seriously. 3 min: There’s a break in play as Rodri takes a heavy fall and requires medical attention. He leaped to contest a high ball and landed awkwardly after colliding with Ilkay Gundogan while airborne. 2 min: Dinamo Zagreb are playing with a back five: three central defenders and two wing-backs in Marin Leovac and Petar Stojanovic. 1 min: Mislav Orsic gets the ball rolling for Dinamo Zagreb, whose players are wearing highlighter pen-coloured fluorescent yellow shirts, shorts and socks. Manchester City’s players wear their usual home kit of light blue shirts, white shorts and white socks. Not long now: Dutch referee Serder Gozubuyuk leads the teams and they line either side of him and his team of match officials for the Champions League. Somewhat predictably, it is booed by the home crowd, who aren’t big fans of Uefa. Elsewhere in Group C: Shakhtar Donetsk have just scored a late, late winner in the fifth minute of added time in their match against Atalanta at the Stadio Atleti Azzurri d’Italia. They’ve won by the odd goal of three. Man City: Ederson, Joao Cancelo, Otamendi, Fernandinho, Mendy, Gundogan, Rodri, Silva, Bernardo Silva, Aguero, Mahrez. Subs: Bravo, Walker, Sterling, Gabriel Jesus, Jose Angelino, Foden, Garcia. Dinamo Zagreb: Livakovic, Stojanovic, Theophile-Catherine, Dilaver, Peric, Leovac, Moro, Arijan Ademi, Olmo, Orsic, Petkovic. Subs: Zagorac, Ivo Pinto, Gavranovic, Gojak, Situm, Atiemwen, Kadzior. Referee: Serdar Gozubuyuk (Netherlands) More from Pep: While talking to the press yesterday, City’s manager acknowledged that fans would prefer to see their team win a third consecutive league title over a maiden victory in the Champions League, but said it was up to him and his players to “seduce” them as far as European competition is concerned. Read on ... Pep Guardiola speaks: During his press conference last night, the Manchester City manager was extolling the virtues of former Barcelona youth player Dani Olmo, who left La Masia a little over five years ago at the age of 16 to join Dinamo Zagreb. “He was in the Barcelona academy in the past and normally the players there are always good players,” he said. “He had the courage to go to Croatia and it looks perfect, he was one of the best players at the Under-21 Euros with an incredible work ethic.” You can read more about Olmo’s move in this feature by Aleksandar Holiga. Nenad Bjelica speaks: “Everyone is in optimal condition and everyone will be able to play,” said Dinamo Zagreb’s coach in his pre-match press conference last night. “You give a lot of importance to tactics and systems, and most importantly, a big heart. We have analysed them and will try to surprise them. Let’s go play a good game, do our best and try to win. Let’s enjoy the game. We want to win. We showed that against Atalanta and so we will try in every game.” Early team news Dinamo Zagreb will be delighted to hear that Kevin De Bruyne has been ruled out of tonight’s game with a groin injury. Riyad Mahrez is likely to start in his place after his excellent performance against Everton over the weekend. . In the absence of Aymeric Laporte and John Stones, Fernadinho is likely to continue playing alongside Nicolas Otamendi in the heart of City’s defence. For Dinamo Zagreb, defenders Kevin Theophile-Catherine and Emir Dilaver were both minor injury doubts, but are expected to be fit for selection. The Etihad Stadium is the venue for tonight’s match between Manchester City and Dinamo Zagreb. The Croatian champions had to come through three rounds of qualifying to make this season’s group stages, seeing off Georgian side Saburtalo, Hungarian outfit Ferencvaros and Norwegian champions Rosenborg along the way. In their opening group game they thrashed Serie A side Atalanta, scoring four without reply, but are likely to face a sterner test on a damp night in Manchester. Kick-off is at 8pm (BST) but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up.
17	Canadian prosecutors have described Joshua Boyle as manipulative and abusive, dismissing the former hostage’s testimony as a “fictional, self-serving narrative” as the crown began its closing arguments in the high-profile trial. On Tuesday afternoon, prosecutors attacked the credibility of Boyle, who, along with his American wife Caitlan Coleman, spent five years as captives of a Taliban-linked militia after they were kidnapped in Afghanistan. Boyle, 36, faces 19 criminal charges – including sexual assault, assault and unlawful confinement – over incidents which allegedly took place after the family returned to Canada. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. “Mr Boyle manipulated [Coleman], exercised control over her, imposed his will on her and instilled fear in her,” said prosecutor Jason Neubauer. “He did this through emotional and physical abuse – demeaning her and striking her.” Wearing an ash-coloured blazer and grey shirt, Boyle sat in court with his parents, taking notes on a pink legal pad. Coleman, who has previously testified by way of video link, did not participate in the court proceedings. Boyle and Coleman, set off on a trip to central Asia after they married in 2011. Soon after entering Afghanistan, they were kidnapped by militants and transferred into the control of the Taliban-linked Haqqani network. The couple had three children during their five-year captivity. In November 2017, the family was freed by Pakistani forces in a rescue operation. After their release, the young family moved to Ottawa, where they lived in an apartment until Boyle’s arrest on 31 December 2017. Boyle’s defence on Monday cast him as an unlikable but honest witness, but the prosecution suggested Boyle’s testimony was motivated by self-interest and included “outright lies”. The crown pointed to instances in which Boyle’s testimony shifted to evade incriminating behaviour, which Neubauer suggested “reflect[ed] poorly on his honesty as a witness”. Earlier in the morning, Boyle’s team spent much of their time working to undermine the credibility of the testimony of Coleman who has accused Boyle of physically and sexually abusing her, both during captivity and during their time living in Canada. Defence counsel Lawrence Greenspon told the court that Coleman’s history of anxiety attacks rendered her memory inaccurate and unreliable. The defence also asked Justice Peter Doody to consider that Boyle and Coleman had recently experienced freedom after five years of captivity. While their marriage was “peculiar”, they were nonetheless “parents in freedom” for the first time and should be afforded a level of “tolerance” when assessing the accused’s conduct. “Mr Boyle is unorthodox. Mr Boyle is unusual,” said Eric Granger, one of Boyle’s lawyers. But the court shouldn’t judge the accused’s credibility on the basis of how much Boyle “deviates from the norm”, said Granger. The prosecution rejected this characterization of Boyle, suggesting his testimony was “rooted in fiction, not fact” and must therefore be rejected by the court. “Boyle’s evidence must be rejected not because he holds unorthodox views,” said Neubauer. “The crown suggests his evidence is unbelievable … because it self-serving. It was argumentative, internally inconsistent and incompatible with common sense.” The prosecution will continue its closing arguments on Wednesday. Boyle has opted for the trial to be overseen by a judge only.
18	Read Jamie Jackson on Manchester City’s win over Dinamo Zagreb Our Champions League round-up, right here: And that will do! Wow, what an odd night. Thanks for joining me for it, and see you again soon! POCHETTINO SPEAKS! “I don’t need too much time to explain. I think we played 30 minuted really really well, really compact and aggressive. Unlucky that we conceded at the end of the first half for 2-1, and of cure after that they were very clinical. I think there’s not very much difference on the attempts but they were very clinical. We scored a penalty and had some chances to score a third but of course we conceded three more goals and it’s a tough, tough result. I think it’s too much and hard to accept this kind of result but that happens when your opponent has so much quality and is so clinical in front of goal. We are very disappointed and upset but need to stay all together. “In this type of situation you need to face it. You need to be strong and keep going. We need to stay all together. The best medicine is to be all together, help each other, not find people guilty. Of course when you receive this type of result it’s important to bounce back and believe in yourselves. That is the only way to recover the good feeling.” Fairly light stuff there, really. Wonder if he’s really feeling that philosophical ... You’ll want to get your hands on this – David Hytner’s report from an extraordinary night: If you’re wondering where any post-match reaction from Pochettino is, we are told that Spurs are “in a meeting”. “Liverpool bounced back from losing a final by winning the whole shebang. Obviously, this is one isolated group match, but it’s hard to see Spurs following that lead,” observes Matt Dony. It is a collector’s item alright! What impressed me about Bayern there was the way in which, as soon as they scented blood, they went for it. No messing about. Once the third went in it was clear they could streak away. If we hold on a little while we might find out ... An unsparing assessment. It might be the second part, you know. What on earth has gone wrong? In the group’s other game Red Star Belgrade have beaten Olympiakos 3-1, making Spurs’ upcoming double-header with the Serbian side all the more crucial. But for now the story is very much in north London. Any reaction you’d like to send in? Are these really the last days of Poch? I’ve never thought so but what we saw just then was deeply, deeply alarming. I ... errrrm .... well. The boos ring out. This was quite extraordinary. 90 min: Bayern have been brilliant for the final hour but this isn’t normal, is it? There’s something wrong with – at - Spurs. What on earth is happening? It’s SEVEN! Gnabry has time to shoot right-footed on the edge of the area, sets himself and whips it past Lloris. Spurs have gone; this has been a quite terrible, terrible capitulation and the repercussions may be long-lasting. This is very messy now. Bayern work this beautifully after Alderweireld gives the ball away, Coutinho nudging a delightful first-time pass to Lewandowski with the outside of his foot and the striker finishing devastatingly. 86 min: Ultimately, this has been a schooling for Spurs. It’s as if they are an elastic band that’s stretched beyond its limit. How do you get that old tension back? And there’s the proof for you. This is brilliant. Bayern keep the ball, wait their moment and then Thiago springs Gnabry through with a 60-yard ball from deep. His first touch, as it drops, is quite sumptuous and he runs through before finishing with aplomb. 81 min: Gnabry has been sensational tonight by the way, and not only for his goals. He looks so, so sharp. World-class. Winks now comes off and Lamela comes on, in Spurs’ next throw. 79 min: So gets to the byline but completely messes up a ball back to a teammate. A rare off note from him. 77 min: This game has had very, very few flat spells but we are amid one. Spurs need something fast now, and hope Eriksen can provide it but the sub shoots wastefully over from the edge of the area when there are better options. 74 min: Coutinho drags one wide and I just wonder if Bayern have rode out that little Spurs flurry now. 73 min: Oh, and I missed Perisic coming on for Coman there. 72 min: Lucas Moura comes on for the quiet Alli, and Bayern bring on Javi Martinez for Boateng, who seems to be injured and is being helped off. 70 min: No, it wasn’t given. Coman was on his way down but there was contact. Not clear and obvious, seemingly, and I’m all for VAR letting refs abide by their own decisions. But I still think Spurs got a bit lucky there ... 69 min: It’s very stretched out there now ... and Coman wants a penalty after Rose slides in and seems to take his legs away. Not given and I think that was fortunate. But they’re having another look ... 66 min: Lewandowski does brilliantly to surge down the left and tee up Gnabry, whose eyes light up the the hat-trick ... but a combination of Vertonghen and Alderweireld lurches in to make him miscue. Then Eriksen takes aim from 20 yards and forces a brilliant tip from Neuer! That’s a fine save and stops Spurs giving themselves real hope! 64 min: Oh, that could have been 4-3. In fairness it’s a difficult, dropping ball 16 yards out for Sissoko and he can’t keep it down. Now Ndombele comes off, after fading following that fine first 30, and here is Eriksen ... 63 min: Big 10 minutes or so now. Will Bayern keep hold of things or do Spurs have the wind in their sails? Put away neatly, and now then!! We could have some half-hour ahead of us ... Yes, it’s given. Looked a bit iffy to me. But now they can get back into it through Kane ... Coman clips Rose in the box, and Bayern aren’t happy because his foot was high as he took possession. But Spurs have a lifeline ... I think. VAR check ... 58 min: A question, and one I’d have asked before his lapse just then. How good is Harry Winks? I don’t mean “How GOOD is Harry Winks?!?!”. I’m more asking if he’s really a top-level midfielder, or got what it takes to be one. I think he can look really nice but I’m not sure. Oh hold on ... 57 min: I’m, errr, not sure what Spurs do now. Of course they try to get back into it. But Bayern are exploiting space ruthlessly and they won’t want this getting any messier. And he’s done it again! Do Bayern think they’re playing Arsenal? Winks is caught on the ball and Bayern are on him like a flash. It’s spirited left to Gnabry, who slots in off the post, and that is the game right there. What a strike this is from the ex-Arsenal man! Just clinical. He gets a run on Alderweireld on the left side after playing a sweet one-two near halfway, cuts inside, feints to shoot and then does – cracking it viciously across Lloris. Long, long way back for Spurs now. 50 min: Coutinho sends Lewandowski on a run and Spurs are a bit fortunate that a loose touch invites Alderweireld to clear up. The defender then releases Alli with a wonderful diagonal, but his shot doesn’t really work Neuer too hard. 48 min: Vertonghen blocks from Lewandowski and Tolisso shoots wide. Spurs don’t want to concede again. 47 min: “Looking at the team sheet I see at least one Bayern substitute who could come in and make a Cuisance of himself,” notes Peter Oh. I’ll let you all scroll down to work that one out. 46 min: Kane gets an early yellow for leaving his arm out in an aerial challenge. Bayern bring on Thiago for Alaba, who did get a bit of a clatter earlier. Expectations for the second half? If Spurs can ratchet up the tempo again they could still draw or even win this game, definitely. Other scores: Man City 0-0 Dinamo Zagreb Red Star Belgrade 0-1 Olympiakos Lokomotiv Moscow 0-0 Atletico Madrid Juventus 1-0 Bayer Leverkusen Galatasaray 0-0 PSG We’ve got the thriller tonight, so far! Well! Spurs led, were pegged back, could have led again and were full throttle for half an hour. But Bayern seized a measure of control in the latter stages and Lewandowski capitalised brilliantly. All to play for after a rattling good half! It’s been all Bayern for the last 15 minutes and we can’t say this wasn’t coming. Lewandowski is involved early in the move with a quite delicious flick by the right byline, resulting in a penalty claim from Tolisso. But play continues and Lewandowski, by now on the edge of the area, turns and cracks in a lethal low finish! 44 min: ... who flops a low one wide, that snicks off the wall. Not worth the two-minute buildup! Anyhow, Bayern do get a corner out of it, defended well by Alderweireld. 43 min: Ndombele is booked for fouling Coutinho, who had got to his feet very quickly from a previous challenge and retrieved the ball. It’s in a brilliant position for Bayern and the numerous players who would fancy this one. Looks like Lewandowski ... 41 min: Gnabry forces Lloris to beat away a meaty cross-shot, and Spurs still can’t really get out at the moment. 39 min: A Bayern corner from the left. They are seeing much more of the ball now. Coutinho’s delivery is good but Spurs flick it away. 38 min: Matt Richman writes on Son ... “As a not-Spurs fan, I have to agree with Mr. Ray. Beyond being someone who has yet to have an egregiously negative headline associated with him, he is pacy, has a relentless work ethic, and a direct-but-still-technical style that would make him an asset on literally any team. He’s one of my favourite active players these days; I just wish he wore a different shirt.” 36 min: A continuation of this good Bayern patch sees Alderweireld crane his neck crucially to stop Kimmich’s dink reaching Lewandowski. 35 min: Coman fizzes one wide of Lloris’s left post now. Bayern, after a rocky spell, have come back into it. 33 min: Lewandowski barges Winks off the ball fairly in midfield and suddenly Bayern look awash with possibility ... until Sissoko comes back and blocks Coman off well. Then Alaba crosses and Lewandowski heads well wide. 31 min: Now Son flashes one wide of the near post. He’s really buzzing tonight. Bayern’s defence is not having a good one here and Neuer sensibly goes long from the goal kick. 30 min: This is much more like the tempo we associate with this Tottenham team, I must say. 28 min: Tottenham have a free-kick 25 yards out and a little to the left of centre. Kane is over it ... and a yard over the bar, too. 26 min: “Is there currently a more likeable player than Son?” queries Speakeasy Ray. “He’s not at a Zola level in that sense but I also don’t know a single footy fan that doesn’t rate him or enjoy watching him.” Spurs might have said “Ndombele” if he’d scored while I was pasting that. Found 15 yards out by Aurier, he has a clear shot at goal but allows Neuer to shovel it wide. Spurs ought to be ahead! 25 min: Gnabry is booked for shamelessly tugging Winks back in midfield after losing possession to him. 22 min: Aurier drills against Coman for a corner – not a penalty, as some of the crowd request, but it’s dealt with. 21 min: Corner kick for Bayern, now, which leads to another. Surely there are more goals in this one. Coutinho shoots straight at Lloris in the aftermath of the second. 19 min: Spurs win a corner after more fine work from Ndombele. This has been non-stop so far. They try a low one but Pavard clears towards Son, who tests Neuer with a 25-yard curler that the keeper clutches. It was probably going wide. 18 min: Kane is denied by Alaba! Son plays it over the top and Neuer is in no man’s land. Kane nicks it around him but, at an angle and on his wrong foot, he doesn’t get enough on his shot towards a vacant net and Alaba can desperately scoop it away! What a start and what a hit! A Bayern skirmish is only half-cleared and Kimmich can take possession 25 yards out. He has too much time to work the ball onto his right foot and lashes a tremendous equaliser into the bottom corner. No sooner were Bayern behind than they’re level! 15 min: Chances at both ends, then, but Spurs have made theirs count. Bayern paid, as so many sides so, for trying to play from deep inside their own area in the face of a lively press. But then ... Tolisso gives the ball away when trying to play from the back and Sissoko, seizing possession, calmly plays in Son – this time on the right of the box. This time he makes no mistake, slamming it across Neuer, and he scores from his third chance of this still-young game! Views? I think Alli is really, really good. 10 min: Alaba is stricken after Aurier jumps in *very* late on him. Let’s say he was trying to hurdle a tackle; otherwise that looked very bad indeed, like a kind of double stamp. Immense clumsiness after anything else, I think, and luckily Alaba is OK. And Spurs are then nearly very OK as Ndombele finds Son beautifully *again*, but with Kane waiting he allows Neuer to gather a cross-shot from a great position. 8 min: Maybe that’s settled Spurs down a touch. They’re now spraying the ball about the giving each other a few touches. 6 min: Bayern are keeping the ball quite well and looking to beat Spurs’ press when possible. But now Neuer is called into action! Ndombele slides Son through beautifully in the left of the area and the Korean has scored these before ... but not this time, as Neuer saves with his legs. One chance apiece! 4 min: Now Coutinho is sent down the right by Pavard and Alderweireld has to hack away his ball towards a poised Lewandowski. 3 min: Big early chance for Bayern, that was. Vital it didn’t go in from a Spurs confidence point of view. 2 min: Spurs pressing Bayern pretty hard early on, disrupting their efforts to play from the back. This is exactly the kind of thing they need to recapture. But then Bayern do get out and Gnabry is played through the middle for a real chance ... saved by Lloris as he blasts towards goal from 18 yards! They are underway! It is a *proper* European atmosphere in a wet, drenched, snarling north London today. They’re up for this! Real did indeed draw. And, in Man City’s group, Shakhtar won late on at Atalanta. Meanwhile we have a light show at Spurs, and two teams lining up in the tunnel ... “I fancy Spurs to do good tonight.” writes Dave Branton. “Poch has named a pretty strong team to start and they started to show some of the last few seasons brilliance and resilience (what’s that, rapping or something?) against Southampton on Saturday. Come on you Spurs!!” If you’d like more football than just this football, Barry Glendenning has Man City v Dinamo Zagreb just for *you*: Elsewhere, Real Madrid have just come from two down to level it at 2-2 against Club Brugge at the Bernabeu. Still a poor result if it stands, but the Belgians are down to 10 for the final few minutes ... Christian Eriksen is on the naughty step bench again as you’ll see. In the Bayern side Serge Gnabry is back in London – he was a youngster at Arsenal, you’ll recall, before going on to bigger things. Yes, Alli starts and this is exactly the kind of game you’d fancy him to pop up with something in ... We’ll dig into the nitty gritty shortly – in the meantime, help yourself to the Bayern latest with this from Ben Fisher: Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Aurier, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Rose, Winks, Sissoko, Ndombele, Alli, Kane, Son. Subs: Sanchez, Lamela, Dier, Gazzaniga, Eriksen, Lucas Moura, Davies. Bayern Munich: Neuer, Pavard, Boateng, Sule, Alaba, Kimmich, Tolisso, Gnabry, Coutinho, Coman, Lewandowski. Subs: Thiago, Javi Martinez, Cuisance, Perisic, Davies, Muller, Ulreich. Referee: Clement Turpin And what a tie this is! So much to like about this one – and so many strands of narrative too! Can Spurs, on such a downer in the last few weeks, build on Saturday’s win over Southampton by securing the kind of European result that has been their preserve of late? It’s this kind of night that can really kick start a season, or at least set the fires alight once again. Mauricio Pochettino hasn’t become a bad manager overnight; quite the contrary. Nor have Spurs become a bad side. And Bayern ... Bayern are surely there to be defeated, and in so doing banishing many of these early doubts. They’re going along nicely at the moment mind you, topping the Bundesliga as of the weekend. It’s a slightly fresher squad than the one that laboured to defeat against Liverpool last season, with Philippe Coutinho among those firmly involved, so you’d expect a little more zip about them here. What Spurs really don’t want is the threat of the kind of salvage operation they had to perform in last season’s group stage, much as that did not really harm them eventually. They really shouldn’t have dropped points against Olympiakos last time out; they could to with at least a draw here against opponents who won routinely enough against Red Star Belgrade. Tonight promises to be anything but routine! Stay close, and send me your emails and tweets!
19	You may like Snackmasters (Channel 4) if you’re a fan of BBC Two’s Inside the Factory, which reveals how popular foodstuffs are made by visiting the production line; or the YouTube series Gourmet Makes, in which a chef reverse engineers a homemade version of a mass-produced snack. Here, visits to the production line of a popular snack are interspersed with – a crucial difference, your honour – two chefs competing to make a superior reverse-engineered version. Week one: KitKats. Daniel Clifford, the head chef at Midsummer House in Cambridge, and Vivek Singh, the boss of the Cinnamon Club in London, have three weeks to perfect a convincing four-finger facsimile. Your host is Fred Sirieix, the maitre d’ whose presence, urbanely silver-bearded and twinkly of eye, is such a comfort on First Dates. He is a minor national treasure, and it would be churlish to criticise him. Except, he’s the presenter of Snackmasters, and criticising is what I’m paid for. So: what exactly does he do to warrant cult-hero status? Telling nervy singletons they look nice in that dress is all very charming, but he is doing the hard prime-time yards now, leading from the front, burdened with making a derivative factertainment format work. Gallic suaveness alone isn’t going to snap any wafers. Our Fred’s main problem is the one at the heart of any contrived reality contest, which is whether anyone at home could give a fig about the outcome. Take it seriously and you risk looking foolish; not seriously enough and you admit the whole escapade is a waste of time. Sirieix tries to square that circle by going for macho hype so enthusiastic that you hope it is flavoured with irony. “These two are so competitive! This is the contest of a lifetime for them!” he says of Clifford and Singh. “Never mind your past accolades, your Michelin stars. This is the defining moment of your career.” Surely he’s taking the mickey? But almost all of Sirieix’s interventions are along the same lines, so it is hard to tell. Definitely having a laugh, or trying to, is Jayde Adams, who is inside the KitKat factory in York. Adams is a comedian rather than a presenter, so it’s up to her to extract the funny from industrialised confectionery. Perhaps she will warm up as the series goes on – it’s pickled-onion Monster Munch next week – but for now she is sticking with gags your dad would do. Thousands of KitKats whiz past on a conveyor belt. Adams grabs one. “That one’s broken. I’ll have that!” So there’s plenty riding on the contestants and, luckily, they come through. Clifford goes for it, spending £1,700 on a bespoke chocolate mould, striving to get precisely the right pattern on his wafer by customising a waffle iron with an angle-grinder and saying things such as: “I haven’t come here to come second.” Singh casually tosses sugar and eggs around in a pan. Clifford puts a KitKat in a centrifuge to distinguish its constituent parts; Singh experiments with using slightly more milk powder. Clifford combines four types of chocolate to try to ape the “unique” KitKat exterior; Singh makes some chocolate. Oddly, neither chef thinks to scrape the coating off some KitKats and remould it, although Clifford does gain an advantage by knowing that the light-brown sticky stuff inside a KitKat is made from … pureed KitKats. This philosophically challenging trade secret – only previously known to the 2 million people who saw it on a 2015 episode of Inside the Factory – is the highlight of Adams’s tour of KitKat HQ. She doesn’t do a joke about it, though (not even the easy one about how they made the first KitKat). At last, we reach the judging, conducted by a panel of five Nestlé high-ups who include, says Sirieix, “hard-to-please factory production manager John” and “ruthless improvement specialist Chiara”. (He’s certainly having a giggle. Isn’t he?) Clifford’s fake KitKat tastes like the real thing, but that counts for little because he suffers an embarrassment to rival a collapsed showstopper in Bake Off: his KitKat doesn’t break, it bends. He moistened his wafer at the last minute and ended up with spongy goo. Singh’s KitKat hasn’t got the right taste, but it’s brittle so it doesn’t spoil the immortal “Have a break, have a KitKat” tagline. He wins by three votes to two. “It’s a wafer-thin result!” quips Sirieix nonsensically, before urging Singh to “have a break”. Having smoothly done the bare minimum, Sirieix melts away, leaving Clifford to sign off by ruing the fact that his wafer was a travesty. “Adding water to it! What a dick.” Don’t worry, mate. It really doesn’t matter.
20	There were 55 minutes on the stadium clock and a look of pure bewilderment on the faces of Tottenham’s defenders. They had just been shredded for the second time in three minutes by Serge Gnabry, Bayern Munich’s former Arsenal winger and, despite having carried the fight to the Bundesliga champions, they were staring at an irretrievable 4-1 deficit. Remarkably, it was only the beginning of the pain for the manager, Mauricio Pochettino, and his team on a night when serious questions could be asked of their character. It has been a difficult season for them so far, with off-field issues from the summer hanging over into the opening weeks. Pochettino has repeatedly given the impression that he has been fighting with one hand tied behind his back. Here, he could do nothing to stop the onslaught as Gnabry and Bayern twisted the knife. This was Gnabry’s night and he finished it with a four-goal haul, as Spurs wilted shamefully in the closing stages. For his hat-trick, he raced away from Jan Vertonghen to collect a long ball from the substitute Thiago Alcântara. He needed only two touches before he swept past Hugo Lloris and, after Robert Lewandowski had added Bayern’s sixth – the striker’s second of the evening – Gnabry beat Lloris yet again. It is incredible to think that Gnabry once spent an unhappy loan spell at West Bromwich Albion under Tony Pulis in the 2015-16 season. He has developed into a world star since leaving the Premier League and he lit up a pulsating night with his pace and precision. Gnabry’s opening goal was arguably the pick of the bunch; the first time he sent shockwaves around the stadium with his acceleration, which took him away from Serge Aurier’s slide tackle on halfway. In what felt like the blink of an eye, he had reached the edge of the Spurs area before he cut inside Toby Alderweireld and buried a shot into the far corner. The result reinforced Bayern’s position at the top of Group B and it left Spurs with only one point from their two ties, after the 2-2 draw at Olympiakos a fortnight ago. They have it all to do in order to reach the knockout rounds for a third season in succession but the more immediate challenge is to come to terms with what was a humiliation. The scars will run deep for some time and the fear is that they could derail their season. In their 137-year history, Spurs have never conceded seven at home and never before have an English team been so badly beaten at home in Europe. It felt like a trick of the imagination that Spurs had taken the lead through Son Heung-min; that they were the better team for the first 30 minutes and that Pochettino was not guilty of too much exaggeration when he said that he felt in his most upbeat mood of the season at half-time. Spurs played with tempo at the outset and it was no surprise when Son put them in front, having gone close on two occasions in the early running. Both of those chances were laid on by Tanguy Ndombele, with the first being the clearer one. Son should have scored but he would make amends. Dele Alli pressed Corentin Tolisso and it was Moussa Sissoko who provided the incision. Son’s low finish had too much on it for Manuel Neuer. Gnabry had shot too close to Lloris in the second minute – the first sign of his threat – and, although Bayern equalised through Joshua Kimmich’s beauty from distance, Spurs had their chances in the first half. Harry Kane rounded Neuer only for David Alaba to clear while Ndombele was denied by Neuer after Aurier’s clever pull-back. Lewandowski’s goal on the stroke of half-time was the turning point and, if nothing else, it highlighted the slender nature of the margins at this level. Tolisso won the ball as he lay on the ground and Lewandowski took a touch, spun and fizzed a low shot into the corner from the edge of the area. Lewandowski has scored in every game of Bayern’s season – apart from the German Super Cup defeat against Borussia Dortmund, which has been their only loss. He is a byword for efficiency. Niko Kovac, the Bayern manager, was compassionate in victory, saying that his team had simply taken an unusually high percentage of their chances and it should be noted that, after Kane’s penalty to make it 4-2, Sissoko and the substitute Christian Eriksen went close for Spurs. As strange as it sounds, Pochettino’s players believed they could fight back at that point. Yet it was a Pochettino soundbite that hung heavy in the air. It was the one about his players giving up once Gnabry had completed his hat-trick. It was unacceptable. The boos from the home crowd rang out with feeling.
21	The IAAF president, Sebastian Coe, has told athletes coached by Alberto Salazar they must sever their links with immediate effect after the American was banned for four years for “orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct”. Coe also accepted that the US Anti-Doping Agency’s case against the legendary distance coach, who guided Mo Farah to six world titles and four Olympic gold medals when the Briton was at the Nike Oregon Project, had been “very serious” but defended sticking up for his friend in the past. “When you have been in the sport as long as I have, friendships and relationships can go back a long way,” said Coe, who earlier on Tuesday ordered Salazar to be stripped of his accreditation at the world championships in Doha. “Alberto and I held world records at the same time. The charges laid by Usada were really serious and we are now in business mode. The Athletics Integrity Unit has already been in contact with those athletes and they are being asked to sever those relationships.” Those who will have to change coaches include Sifan Hassan, the world 10,000m champion. When Coe was asked whether the ban reflected poorly on Farah, he said: “Athletes have to have complete and total trust in their coaches and if they don’t the relationship will fray,” he said. “And if a coach is accused of something an athlete has to ask really detailed questions. You have to assume athletes do that.” However Steve Magness, a former member of the Nike Oregon Project, a group that was initially set up to help US endurance athletes beat the best runners from Africa but later recruited Farah, said the British athlete should face questions for deciding to stick with Salazar for two years after Usada launched its investigation in 2015. “People make mistakes but they have to own up and that’s where Farah and a lot of other people who stuck it out have to answer questions,” he said. Jeffrey Brown, who worked as a paid consultant endocrinologist for Nike on performance enhancement and served as a physician for many of Salazar’s athletes, also received a four-year ban. In a statement, Travis Tygart, the CEO of US Anti-Doping, praised the numerous whistleblowers who had come forward and condemned Salazar and Brown’s behaviour. “The athletes in these cases found the courage to speak out and ultimately exposed the truth,” he added. “While acting in connection with the Nike Oregon Project, Mr Salazar and Dr Brown demonstrated that winning was more important than the health and wellbeing of the athletes they were sworn to protect.” But the 61-year-old Salazar said he was “shocked” by the outcome and would appeal. “The Oregon Project has never and will never permit doping,” he said. “Throughout this six-year investigation my athletes and I have endured unjust, unethical and highly damaging treatment from Usada.” Farah was with Salazar for nearly seven years during which time he went from being just outside elite level to virtually unbeatable. He stuck with his famed coach after allegations against Salazar first surfaced in a BBC and ProPublica report in 2015 and left only in 2017. At the time, Farah denied his decision was connected to the doping claims. Usada first brought doping charges against Salazar and Brown in June 2017 in a court battle that was heard behind closed doors. Meanwhile, Nike said that it would back Salazar’s appeal and that Usada’s decision had “nothing to do with administering banned substances to any Oregon Project athlete”. “As the panel noted, they were struck by the amount of care Alberto took to ensure he was complying with the world anti-doping code. We support Alberto in his decision to appeal and wish him the full measure of due process that the rules require. Nike does not condone the use of banned substances in any manner.” Nike is facing questions after emails released by the US Anti-Doping Agency revealed the sportswear company’s chief executive Mark Parker was briefed on Salazar’s experiments to determine whether the use of topical testosterone cream would trigger a positive doping test that were conducted in a laboratory at Nike’s headquarters. On a separate occasion Salazar also wrote to Lance Armstrong to recommend he try the amino acid L-carnitine when he was training for an Ironman. “Lance, call me asap! We have tested it and it’s amazing! All completely legal and natural. You will finish the Iron Man in about 16 minutes less while taking this.” Armstrong said in an email to the Wall Street Journal that he never tested or tried L-carnitine.
22	Pep Guardiola’s introduction of Raheem Sterling after the break transformed this second group-stage match for Manchester City. Until then Dinamo Zagreb had stymied England’s champions, yet 10 minutes after entering Sterling had a 10th goal in 12 appearances and City were cruising to a second victory and had Group C in their control. The forward completed a scintillating cameo by creating Phil Foden’s second on 95 minutes. “He’s a player who is always there, he has this talent,” Guardiola said of Sterling. “He loves to score goals, you always have that feeling. He said a few days ago he missed chances at Everton [where he also scored] but he was always thinking of the next one. I think still he can improve his finishing. Today the pass for Phil was perfect. But still there is a gap to be even more clinical – but it’s important that all the time he’s there and that’s why he’s been able to score the goals.” Guardiola made five changes from the victory at Everton. Kevin De Bruyne was omitted due to a groin problem – his availability for the visit of Wolves on Sunday is in the balance – while Bernardo and David Silva, Benjamin Mendy, João Cancelo and Sergio Agüero all came in. Sterling, Gabriel Jesus, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Kyle Walker were the others to drop out. Zagreb had won their previous match 4-0 on Friday and arrived hoping to end a dismal streak of 12 consecutive losses in Champions League away group games. Guardiola’s wish that City fans be “seduced” by the competition was not answered during the pre-game anthem, which was booed as has become customary at the Etihad, and the contest was stopped almost instantly following kick-off when Rodri fell awkwardly. This may have affected City’s rhythm because they were slow to settle, with one needlessly loose pass from Agüero indicative of the wider problem. Guardiola had again plumped for the centre-back pairing of Fernandinho and Nicolás Otamendi but neither they nor the rest of the defence could stop Dino Peric rising to head at Ederson’s goal from a free-kick. The effort went too high. Yet action in the visitors’ area was served up on a near-permanent loop until half-time, Agüero repeatedly receiving the ball and looking to fire a shot off or find Riyad Mahrez. What kept the score level was a dogged Dinamo rearguard and the referee’s refusal to award a penalty when Kévin Théophile-Catherine seemed to handball near goal. The latter incident was surely an example of what VAR is supposed to clear up but Nenad Bjelica’s team were allowed to escape. Seconds later, David Silva also thought he had a decent penalty shout but Serdar Gözübüyük was again not interested in awarding the kick. By the interval, City had somehow failed to breach Dominik Livakovic’s goal though Guardiola’s instructions may have been to simply keep on keeping on, given his team’s dominance. What the manager will not have suggested was for Rodri to begin the second half by giving the ball up for Bruno Petkovic to run clear towards Ederson. But as his teammates waited to be played in the No 9 dawdled and the danger fizzled out. Zagreb soon committed their own howler, a mix-up between Peric and Livakovic letting the ball spill to Agüero, who could not quite capitalise as the angle tightened. Next, a slick City corner ended with Ilkay Gündogan chipping the ball to the back post towards a lurking Agüero before Livakovic cleared with a punch. Eleven minutes into the second period Guardiola had seen enough, and he took off the muted Bernardo Silva for Sterling in an attempt to find the killer touch that had been absent. City camped in the final third but frustration grew as the yellow wall put up by Croatia’s champions remained firm. That was until, at last, the hosts made the breakthrough when Sterling hammered home a precise Mahrez cross and Guardiola celebrated with the home support. The manager’s decision to bring on Sterling had gained City the ascendancy they deserved. What they did not receive was a penalty when Petar Stojanovic took Sterling down – but the decision looked correct, Stojanovic connecting with ball first. It did however spark a Guardiola tantrum and the Catalan was booked – much to his chagrin. This, though, ended as a satisfying evening for him and his side, capped when Sterling broke clear to set up Foden, the midfielder slotting coolly home in the closing moments. Of the 19-year-old, who has never been selected for a senior England squad, Sterling said: “I am buzzing for Phil and I want him in the national team, if he keeps going he will be there.” It is indicative of City’s depth that Foden is not yet a regular in their XI.
23	Boris Johnson has struck a secret deal with the Democratic Unionist party involving radical proposals for a Belfast-Dublin “bilateral lock” on post-Brexit arrangements on the island of Ireland. Details have emerged of the prime minister’s final Brexit offer that he will lay out on Wednesday, with Northern Ireland staying under EU single market regulations for agri-food and manufactured goods until at least 2025, at which point its assembly in Stormont will decide whether to continue alignment with EU or UK standards. Johnson set up a high-stakes fortnight of talks with a threat that he will press ahead with a no-deal exit if the EU27 fails to engage with his plans. No 10 is hoping the proposals will be enough to entice the EU back into negotiations ahead of the crunch EU summit on 17 October, with Johnson telling a reception at the Conservative party conference on Tuesday that the next 48 hours would be crucial. The proposal that Ireland would have “two borders for four years” once the transition period ends after 2020 is likely to receive a frosty welcome in EU capitals. The broadcaster RTÉ quoted an Irish government source saying Johnson’s deal, as reported on Tuesday evening, would not be acceptable to Dublin. However, DUP sources have confirmed that the party is largely “content” with the proposals, which are believed to still include a lot of elements of the backstop – a major concession for the party. One central element of the proposals is expected to be a “Stormont lock,” giving local parties a say on any future proposals to keep the region aligned to EU rules and maintain an invisible border with the Republic of Ireland if Britain decided to diverge from European standards on goods and food. Also crucial is the reestablishment of a newly empowered British-Irish ministerial council which was set up under the Belfast/Good Friday agreement but has not sat for three years. The restored council would give representatives from Stormont and the Irish parliament oversight on the future regulatory regime on the island of Ireland. In his speech to the Conservative party conference in Manchester on Wednesday, the embattled prime minister will outline what he will call a “fair and reasonable compromise”, which Downing Street says has been drawn up after 70 hours of discussions with other EU member states. He will insist that if the EU27 fails to engage with his proposals, he will press ahead with a no-deal Brexit at the end of October. Brussels has warned there will be a cold reception if the offer resembles draft proposals leaked on Monday, which would involve customs clearance sites five to 10 miles from the Irish border – later denied by Johnson. One EU source said: “Perhaps they realise if it’s anything that looks like what was floated in this leak, it is going to go down like a bucket of sick.” No 10 briefed EU capitals on Tuesday on its controversial proposals and the plans are due to be published in full on Wednesday Northern Ireland would not stay in the EU’s customs territory, as Johnson explained on Tuesday in a round of media interviews, meaning there would be two borders for four years. Johnson told the BBC: “If the EU is going to insist on customs checks as we come out as it is, then we will have to accept that reality. And there will have to be a system, for customs checks away from the border. Now, we think those checks can be absolutely minimal and non-intrusive and won’t involve new infrastructure.” The move by the UK to align with full EU regulations on goods for a period of four years has been privately welcomed by the EU member states. The four-year time limit will dismay the Irish government, however. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, has repeatedly said such a time limit would be no better for Ireland than a no-deal today, given the uncertainty that would be created for the north-south economy. The UK’s insistence that Northern Ireland will not stay in the EU’s customs territory, and that extra customs checks and controls would be required on the island of Ireland, is another major red line crossed for Dublin. One source said the British-Irish council would be a “big part of moving along” the part of the backstop that was unattractive to the DUP – a regulatory barrier down the Irish Sea. It also would be a “double lock” on any move by Northern Ireland to diverge from EU rules applying in the republic. “We need a mechanism so that the future relationship is not just left to London and Brussels,” said one insider. “A north-south ministerial council allows us to work things out between us.” The proposals “deal with a lot of the issues the backstop was designed to deal with,” said a source close to the secret talks. “Everyone wants a deal. The DUP wants a deal, Dublin wants a deal, we want a deal. We are hopeful. It doesn’t mean we have the cake, but we are hoping we have the ingredients for one.” However, the proposals risk a legal challenge as the Withdrawal Act 2019, also known as the Benn Act, bars any new infrastructure including customs checks on the border that did not exist before Brexit. Johnson will tell the conference that even remainers now want to “move on” – a finding from recent focus groups. “Voters are desperate for us to focus on their other priorities,” he will say. Cabinet ministers are bullish about the prospects of securing a deal before the 17 October European council – but sketchy about the details. One told the Guardian they feared any bid to circumvent the Benn Act forbidding him leaving on Halloween without a deal would ultimately result in the supreme court forcing Johnson’s hand, but that by determinedly dubbing it the “surrender bill”, he had driven home the message that any delay would not be his fault. However, Johnson will insist again on Wednesday that he will not budge from the Halloween deadline. “Let’s get Brexit done on 31 October so in 2020 our country can move on,” he will say. The government has also opened up communications channels to Labour MPs in recent days in the hope that some who fear the consequences of a second referendum could yet support a Brexit agreement. At a DUP reception, the party’s leader, Arlene Foster, put on a show of unity with Johnson whose speech was greeted with chants of “Boris, Boris” and “no surrender”. She said the return of devolution to Northern Ireland was “critically important” and added: “I know a lot of people out there who want to get on with their lives, who are sick, sore and tired of listening to Brexit. They want to get Brexit done … we want to see an agreement reached.” After his speech, Johnson said: “I’m not going to pretend this is going to be easy. This is not a walk in the park but we have made huge progress and I hope very much that in the course of the next two days we are going to get there.” He said that after getting Brexit done, he wanted to put Jeremy Corbyn into a “figurative rocket” and “put him into orbit where he belongs”, with one audience member heckling with a violent suggestion that the Labour leader should face a “noose”. As well as outlining his plans for a Brexit deal, Johnson will draw up battle lines for the general election – including seeking to bracket Labour with the Scottish National party, a move the Tories used successfully against Ed Miliband’s Labour party in 2015. Johnson has also been keen to change the subject to domestic policy. There were some suggestions in Manchester that he could unveil a headline-grabbing tax cut on Wednesday to distract attention from the details of the backstop plan.
24	The England defence coach, John Mitchell, has claimed World Cup officials are taking too long deliberating over decisions at the tournament and fears introducing more technology to help referees could make matters worse. Mitchell was referring to Wales’s victory against Australia on Sunday which featured Rhys Patchell’s controversial tackle on Samu Kerevi, who was penalised for challenging his opponent with his forearm. The incident subsequently caused a storm with the Australia head coach, Michael Cheika, claiming he was “embarrassed” by the confusion surrounding World Rugby’s crackdown on high tackles and Kerevi suggesting that rugby had gone “soft”. From the initial break in play to Patchell slotting the penalty there was a delay of more than five minutes, while during the first half of England’s opening match against Tonga there were four incidents referred to the TMO before half-time, leading to a first half of nearly an hour and denying Mitchell’s side the chance to find much rhythm. Indeed, they did not score a bonus-point try until the 77th minute. This week, however, the World Rugby vice-president Agustín Pichot revealed the governing body is exploring the possibility of employing Hawk-Eye technology in an effort to police the offside line with a number of blatant incidents missed by officials in Japan. Four years ago the opening rounds of the World Cup were plagued by the large number of TMO referrals, however, which led to increased delays and frustration among supporters. “The only thing I would say is that as fans of the game, if there’s going to be large debates about decisions – like that case the other day – let’s make sure those large amounts of time where there’s a debate around something are focused on priorities as opposed to just taking a long time,” Mitchell said. “We’re seeing more and more stoppages in the game and I don’t think that’s going to stop. That’s the only thing, there’s a huge amount of stoppages.” Mitchell also insisted that England were not serial offenders when it comes to straying offside, revealing he comes down hard on those who transgress and even keeps a record of those who do. “It’s a really big part of our behaviour in terms of staying onside, its something we work a lot on and work very hard on should an individual transgress in that area,” he added. “We even measure it, that’s how critical we are in terms of wanting to make sure that we get that right. We’re a big believer in the half-yard that we take gives us the chance to create more speed anyway as a defensive line.” The England fly-half George Ford said: “Our aim is to be whiter than white because the thing we’ve seen is that one penalty can change the momentum of the game massively. A lot of them are coming from offside, so a lot of them are probably coming from the collision area as well. It’s something we want to be ultra disciplined in.”
25	His teammates call him “Chief” but for Manu Tuilagi there are only a few weeks left in which to rule the world. He sounds pretty sure this will be his final World Cup, even though he is just 28. “I’ll be too old, mate,” he murmured, asked about the possibility of him being involved in 2023. “I feel it.” Opponents, however, should not breathe too deep a sigh of relief. According to John Mitchell, England’s assistant coach, Tuilagi has the air of someone with “a bit of unfinished business” in a white jersey. “He has a real presence and looks like he has real strength and belief both in the team and himself,” Mitchell said after England had worked up a training-ground sweat in front of 600 locals and children on a hot, humid morning. The pool game against Argentina on Saturday will also revive memories of the days when Tuilagi was young, carefree and not yet spending half his life on a treatment table. His World Cup debut was against the Pumas in Dunedin in 2011, after which he received a £5,000 fine for wearing an illegal gumshield. Few imagined then that he would still be waiting to taste victory in a World Cup knockout fixture eight years later. Hence why Tuilagi, whose father is a chief of the family’s Samoan village, is assuming nothing in Japan. The big man cuts a more mature figure these days, with his ferry-jumping days now dipped in sepia, and knows he can never resuscitate his 20-year-old self. “I could never be the old me again. It’s different now. The old me used to just go out and play. Now I need to warm up for 30 minutes before I even start.” His lengthy injury absences have also taught him to relish whatever rugby experiences he has left. “I know that it is not going to last for ever, that it is not going to last very long so I have got to enjoy the moment while it is here.” For that simple reason he says he enjoys playing for England “more now than before” and his coaches are seeing as much on the training field. Mitchell also reckons fatherhood has mellowed the Leicester centre and that he is now ready to make up for lost time. “I think he is in a particularly good space because he is being managed well. He is also just that much older. He has been through a few rugby movies in his time and knows this stage doesn’t always come around. He’s a difficult tackle for anyone and he can also spook players through his defensive pressure. If he gets you man and ball it’s not that comfortable for the attack.” Tuilagi, however, is keen to play down the “unfinished business” tag, preferring to discuss the collective midfield threat he believes England can pose. There is no official confirmation as yet but it seems all but certain George Ford, Owen Farrell and Tuilagi will line up alongside each other against the Pumas. For the latter, it would be a perfect combination. “I love it. We’ve been together for a long time so we all know how each other plays – our strengths and our weaknesses. I’ve played a few games now alongside Fordy and Farrell and their knowledge of the game is unbelievable. I try and stay as close to them as possible. The way they see the game is different level.” Ford, unsurprisingly, also argues that having two 10s in midfield is a plus that England should not abandon now. “To have two like‑minded players on the field who think like 10s – where the space is, doing the right thing at the right time, the kicking and passing options – is a huge strength. I’ve obviously played with Owen through the age groups and a fair bit at senior level so the understanding is good between us.” England’s starting XV could also yet contain the fit-again Mako Vunipola if the management decide he is best deployed from the outset opposite his Saracens clubmate Juan Figallo rather than the bench. The Pumas’ strong set-piece may also conceivably bring Courtney Lawes or Mark Wilson into the equation at blindside, although Tom Curry and Billy Vunipola are certain back-row starters. Mitchell, for one, reckons a horses-for-courses selection is the way to go. “Ultimately it comes down to creating the right team mix for this game as opposed to just selecting the best individuals or the best team. That is very much the way we go about it.”
26	Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 2 October. Top stories Hong Kong police have shot a protester with live ammunition for the first time in four months of demonstrations, marking a major escalation in the use of force on a day when China celebrated 70 years of Communist party rule with a triumphalist military parade. Protests called to mark a “national day of grief” drew tens of thousands of people on to the city’s streets in the most widespread show yet of public anger towards Beijing. Although warning shots have been fired during other protests and police have caused serious injury with rubber bullets and beanbag rounds, this was the first time someone has been hit with a live round. The commissioner of police, Stephen Lo Wai-chung, said the use of a live round was “lawful and reasonable” and the man had been arrested for assaulting a police officer after he was taken to hospital. Most Australians believe Scott Morrison was wrong to snub the UN climate summit, but have otherwise backed the prime minister’s handling of the relationship with Donald Trump. The latest Guardian Essential poll, taken in the wake of Morrison’s trip to the US last week, shows that most Australians believe it is important for the prime minister to have a good relationship with the US president, “whoever they might be”. While 15% of people disagreed with the statement, 77% agreed, with men and Liberal voters most likely to back a strong relationship. The survey of 1,097 people was taken before Tuesday’s revelation that Australia had agreed to help investigate the genesis of the Mueller inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US election, which Trump has suggested was a “hoax” to bring him down. Australia’s vast carbon sink is releasing millions of tonnes of CO2 back into the atmosphere. Australia’s mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass meadows are absorbing about 20m tonnes of carbon dioxide every year, according to a major study that is the first to measure in detail the climate benefits of the coastal ecosystems. But the study, published in the journal Nature Communications, warns that degradation of these “vegetated coastal ecosystems” was already seeing 3m tonnes of CO2 per year being released back into the atmosphere. The NSW government is, meanwhile, considering legislation that could limit the ability for planning authorities to rule out coalmine projects based on the climate change impact of emissions from the coal once it is burned. World Boris Johnson’s has been criticised in Dublin and Berlin for signalling the possible return of a hard border, which could dash his hopes of entering into decisive Brexit negotiations next week. The UK prime minister is expected to table his long-awaited proposals for the Irish border after making his speech at Conservative party conference in Manchester on Wednesday.

There must be a better way than sending homeless patients back on the street after a hospital visit, writes Ranjana Srivastava: “Perhaps the raison d’etre of a public hospital is to treat medical illness and accept that entrenched poverty, homelessness, drug addiction and chronic mental health issues are simply beyond our remit. This would certainly ease our conscience, but it doesn’t seem right, especially when such patients are the most likely to return to our doors, each time a little sicker, a little more expensive and time-consuming. The truth is, medical illness cannot be separated from socioeconomic factors, which is why good healthcare needs better out-of-hospital supports.” Sport There are many ways to get knocked out of the Champions League and, if that fate does befall Real Madrid, they may just have chosen the daftest of all, writes Sid Lowe.

Thinking time: Republicans, impeachment and an elusive strategy Republicans are flailing as they seek a coherent strategy against impeachment, writes Tom McCarthy: “Republicans have ‘decided on a new strategy’ to address a whistleblower complaint against Donald Trump, joked Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican national committee and a frequent critic of the president. Steele tweeted a slapstick video of a woman trying to sweep sand into the ocean as the tide rolled in. He was lampooning something noted by veterans of the last impeachment fight, targeting Bill Clinton, and others. One week after the Democrats opened their official inquiry, the president and his party are still improvising a defense and have yet to hit on a coherent response. “‘It’s as if the Trump campaign has read the Clinton playbook and at every turn opted for the opposite,’ said David Frum, a conservative columnist in the 1990s who was later a speechwriter for George W Bush, writing in the Atlantic. Where Clinton tried to appeal to voters in the middle and stay focused on policy, counting on impeachment to blow over, Frum wrote, Trump is ‘wholly obsessed with impeachment … raving nonstop against the whistleblower, the House, and all his political foes – seen and unseen’.” Media roundup The Sydney Morning Herald reports that Australian women and children were forced to “cower in their tents in fear of their lives overnight as shooting broke out between Islamic State hardliners and Kurdish forces at the al-Hawl camp in Syria”.

27	For a few thrilling seconds halfway down the home straight Adam Gemili had a 200m world championships medal locked and loaded. All the 25-year-old needed to do was carry his form through the final 60 metres, usually the best of his race. And then, savagely, lady luck intervened to scupper his dreams yet again. A wobble became a stumble. And a stumble turned a silver or bronze into yet another fourth place finish. Understandably, having seen a first global medal slip through his fingers yet again, the tears started to flow - and so began another brutally honest postmortem. “I am gutted,” said Gemili. “I had it. I lost my balance. I had nothing left at the end. All my form went out of the window. I ran like an amateur, I cannot believe it, I came so close, this was such a good chance. My body feels good, I ran well through the heats. I let it go.” His time of 20.03sec was a season’s best. But it was painfully short of the American Noah Lyles, who celebrated his first world title after coming home in a modest 19.83 sec. Short of the Canadian Andre De Grasse, who took silver in 19.95. And short of the Ecuadorian Alex Quinonez, who came home in 19.98. “I am sorry, I feel like I have let down so many people,” admitted Gemili. “So many people sent me messages. The team know I have been plagued with injuries.” Gemili has had this feeling before. At the 2016 Rio Olympics he finished fourth in the 200m final, three thousands of a second away from bronze. “It’s the same, if not worse than that feeling after Rio because of the story behind it, where I’ve come from after injuries and being written off completely. “To not break 20 seconds is so disappointing and heartbreaking. I had the medal and it slipped out of my hands. Fourth is the same as eighth, the same as 16th. Unless you’re on the podium, who cares?” Still, at least Gemili ended on an upbeat note. “It hasn’t happened today, but it has relit something inside me,” he said. “If I go to Tokyo it’s winnable.” It means that Britain still only has one medal after five days of competition. However Dina Asher-Smith is a penalty kick away from gold in the 200m after yet another potential rival, Elaine Thompson, was ruled out through injury. It means that only four of the top 10 in the world will be in Wednesday’s final – with Asher-Smith fastest of all. “Dina is going to win,” predicted Gemili. “This is the best opportunity for a female sprinter to win a medal. She’s miles apart from everyone. It’s not about if she’s going to win it, it’s about how fast she can go. I’m hoping she can do something really special.” Elsewhere there was an easy victory in the 800m for the Nike Oregon Project athlete Donavan Brazier in a US record 1:42.34, ahead of the Bosnian Amel Tuka and the Kenyan Ferguson Cheruiyot Rotich. When Brazier was asked what he knew about Alberto Salazar’s doping ban, he surprised his audience by telling them: “I didn’t actually know the investigation was going on. And he’s not my coach - I’m coached by Pete Julian.” When some put it to him that what had happened might have changed his opinion of Salazar he shook his head. “No. The only contact I’ve had with Alberto has been pleasant. I like Alberto. He’s a cool guy.” And when asked if he would stay with the Oregon Project, he added: “Yeah, if Pete takes control.” Meanwhile a thrilling men’s pole vault competition was won by the American Sam Kendricks, who cleared 5.97m to defeat the Swedish teen sensation Mundo Duplantis to gold.
28	Most space rocks that hurtle towards Earth burn up in the atmosphere. The moon’s lack of atmosphere means it does not have the same protection, and consequently its surface is peppered with craters. The oldest and largest crater – a massive 2,000km across and 13km deep – sits at the far side of the moon. Known as the South Pole Aitken basin, this crater fascinates scientists because it may help reveal what’s inside the moon. Data from Nasa’s Grail mission in 2011 mapped the moon’s gravitational field and showed that the South Pole Aitken basin exerted a strong pull. Scientists speculate that this might be due to a large chunk of nickel and iron embedded beneath the crater – perhaps the remnants of the asteroid that created it. Or it could be an anomalously dense region in the moon’s interior. Now data from the Chinese Chang’e 4 rover – which rolled across the crater in January 2019 – appears to rule out the asteroid remnant theory. Early results indicate that the crater surface is dominated by a common moon crust mineral called plagioclase, while minerals expected in the moon’s interior are rare, suggesting that the impact that created the crater did not pierce the moon’s crust.
29	Sad to see chatty Priya go! We’ll tira-miss you. Wonder if lawless Henry will be wearing her bobby pins next week? Meanwhile Steph, a.k.a Iron Fringe, sits firmly on the throne for the third time. Thanks to all y’all for the puns and opinions. See you next time for scouring pad sandwich week? Or whatever that was. In the meantime come say hi on braggysnaps or the angry place, or if you want to make me combust like a rum-stuffed bombe, buy my book! Ciao x But sleek bobbed Priya must return to CBeebies. Love that Henry had already picked out what he was gonna nick. And Michael admits he was “flirting with the bottom.” Take off the brooch! It’s cursed! (Obviously) Not...Henry? He’s only just become a man this week. I want to see how he turns out. Priya to go? Steph for Prime Minister? I would eat the heckins out of Henry’s cake. Judges unimpressed, however. A LOT of rum, yup. Hic.” Go on ALice Steph is baking at a professional standard. Rosie’s bridesmaid’s dress of a cake looks like a Joel Schumaker Batman bombe, while Michael has made a “Queen’s mum’s hat” of a pudding. LOL at these adverts saying ‘get ready for Brexit’ in calm, chirpy tones. YOU GET READY FOR BREXIT you mendacious incompetents. Ooh, Steph has absolutely nailed that bombe. No handshake, but certainly in pole position. I gather that we are all fans of drunken Alice, sweary Henry, and want to eat a bombe tout suite. I am very pleased that tiramisu is getting a kicking from you lot too because I find it an uncomfortably moist proposition. Please someone GIF David and Henry spinning the turntable together, with Unchained Melody piped in over the top. I like the close up shots of Michael’s freckles I definitely want Steph to win. Definitely. Go Steph.” Does Steph possess incriminating footage of David, or have a sniper trained on him at all times? Is he in the same bind as Kevin Bacon? Intriguing development. Henry appears to be nailing this. He set all his layers at once– which sounded like pie in the sky, but is actually honey mousse in a bowl. Nothing like a turning out a cake to turn one’s stomach out with bake anxiety. I’m actually most excited about Rosie’s flavours. But Steph looks like she’s in control. What do we think is going to go down? Love the boy’s club! Henry, Michael and David discussing the setting temperature of gelatin. The only kind of stag do I can stomach. “I wish I cared,” cuts through Sandi. David is making what looks like a spirulina smoothie, while Rosie is making a Hallmark sunset collage about puppies that love their mums or something? WHAT is Henry doing? Cardboard discs? Simultaneous setting? Love has turned his head. Steph is replacing sponge with a maverick mousse. She’s making a mirror-bombe that doesn’t shine? Is she a genius aiming at a target we can’t see, or has she pressed the self-destruct? The chocolate....what’s it called? Mousse.” Very refreshing from Steph, in amongst all the jaconde this and bavarois that Priya just said Chambord smells like Calpol. CAN WE FACT CHECK THIS. Did she say her sponge was ‘fatless’ or ‘backless’? Alice’s bombe sounds more alcoholic than happy hour. Definitely coming round to her. Prue’s hair is like Cruella de Verrine It’s Michael’s birthday as well? If we’d known, we would have baked a cake. Let’s give him star baker for the hell of it! Government keyword-tracking spyware must be going nuts right now @Tallulahbankhead I am well jelly of your custardy wordplay David does excellently, Priya has plus de streusel. She comes in last with Michael, David is second and Alice takes it! KNEW IT. Everyone did very well, though. Bakers fitting biscuit discs to glasses of identical diameter is filling me with anxiety. Henry’s raspberry and cream shirt is vee nice, isn’t it. I want to wear that while eating Alice’s verrine. Did someone say they are dating? How lovely. If the panna cotta isn’t set, the raspberry jelly will fall straight through it. But I bet a video of that happening in slow motion would be the most soothing thing ever. I bet Alice knocks this outta the park. I have a feeling. I would want her to make my verrine terrine. Steph strikes me as the kind of girl who secretly smokes and goes out on schoolnights but because her grades are good she never gets in trouble. A rare and very special breed. Steph and Rosie haven’t made panna cotta? Even I have, many times. The ease to impressiveness ratio is unimpeachable. Seriously where can I get these verrines from? I’m not making one. Does Priya talk a lot? I’ve not really noticed that. M&amp;S are you listening? Look at this #sponcon. Please send puds. Ooh, that DOES look tasty though. Like those little M&amp;S puds you can get. Sounds like an anti-fungal foot powder Henry’s gone with the artisanal Italian bread for his foot long. Also he is wearing a spiderweb brooch in homage to Helena! How come I can’t take a mini pack of KP on a plane but Steph can make a nut meringue coated in nuts, served on a giant nut, with nut-sufferer Rosie right next to her? Open act of war. Michael telling Paul what’s wrong with his own cake is painfully relatable. Looks at David’s beautiful effort. Like a Cezanne. Tastes like one too, apparently. Priya’s overbaked mauve cake is described as unappetising, which on behalf of Prince fans I find offensive. Alice’s cherry cake looks like the money shot in an episode of Dexter. Thank you @StellaCoyle! Am feeling much better. I agree with many of you, meringue is...an odd sensation in the mouth. Sickly polystyrene. The ghost of an egg getting married in Las Vegas. Henry is making what looks like a foot long meatball Subway? In the spirit of Kenneth Williams, I note that Rosie is struggling with her grainy ganache. There’s a cream for that etc Prue is working on her birthday! Happy birthday for several months ago, Prue! Steph is doing an Eton Mess. Make your Brexit jokes…now! There’s a wild-eyed proficiency to Alice I find very scary. I’m going to call her Gone Girl. Scone Girl? You can tell dessert is kryptonite to David. A moment on the lips, an extra seven reps of high intensity training targeting core and hips. Look at him putting star anise in meringue. You want to look at a meringue and think ‘Mmm, I want to eat that.” -Paul Hollywood earning the metric tonne of gold bullion he’s paid per episode Me neck, me back, meringue and, ah, me cake Michael is right, an Agatha Christie set in the tent would be bananas good. If this show was on ITV they’d have worked in some sort of murder element already. “To lose one baker may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.” Oscar Wilde. Yes, I’ve been convalescing with books of florid thespians. I blame single mums. Woah WOAH. I’m away for one week and you somehow lose both Michelle, the best baker in the tent, and Helena, aka MY WIFE? What…what have you done to the place while I was away?? Was it Kenneth Tynan who said ‘If Peter O’ Toole was any prettier, it would be Florence of Arabia”? Magical stuff. Ooh look lively, here we go. Does anyone have any stupidly early predictions based on nothing? Does Kevin Bacon do films anymore or is it just EE adverts? What exactly do they have on him? To clarify: I’m not on commission with Baileys, and am livid about that. What are we all eating and drinking for tonight’s entertainment? Feels like Baileys weather to me. Welcome, to the party ID7160783!! Although writing this makes me feel like a Mos Eisley cantina bouncer who didn’t get the memo re: droids Many thanks to Hannah for doing such a sterling job last week! Single mums don’t get enough recognition. (Hannah isn’t a single mum, but that doesn’t invalidate my point.) Thanks Snailywhaley &amp; Brolene. I’m back! Took me a week and heavy machinery to hack off my face-briar. Had to call in the fire-briar-brigade. That was a close shave. Hola my cherubim, Welcome to the only Great British Bake Off live blog that is never made from concentrate. Each week I write up the episode’s highs and lows in real time, while everyone else is free to get involved in the comments. Tonight, it’s dessert week.

30	Up to 6,000 current and former employees at Wesfarmers’ industrial division were underpaid an estimated $15m, Guardian Australia has learned. The head of Wesfarmers industrial division, David Baxby, wrote to staff on Tuesday morning, following inquiries from Guardian Australia last week, to inform them that an internal review had found staff had been underpaid going back as far as 2010. At least 2,000 current and 4,000 former staff of Blackwoods, Workwear Group, Coregas and Greencap were all underpaid in what the company has said was an inadvertent error. The error was only discovered when the industrial division went to upgrade to a new payroll system as part of the move to one-touch payroll. Wesfarmers said the error mostly related to entitlements and car expenses. The company has estimated almost half of the $15m owed to workers is superannuation on loadings and allowances. “These were inadvertent errors but they are deeply regrettable and we apologise sincerely and unreservedly to our team members who have been affected over a number of years,” Baxby said. PricewaterhouseCoopers was brought in to review the extent of the underpayments and Baxby said the fair work ombudsman had been informed as part of the process. The company was aiming to pay the money owed to workers as quickly as possible, Baxby said. “Our priority is to back pay all affected team members as quickly as possible, including interest, to ensure affected team members are fully compensated,” Baxby said. “We are also investing heavily in our payroll system, processes and capabilities to fix this issue and ensure it cannot happen again.” The fair work ombudsman, Sandra Parker, said she would be holding Wesfarmers to account. “Each week, another large company is publicly admitting that they failed to ensure staff are receiving their lawful entitlements,” she said. “This simply is not good enough. “Companies will be held accountable for breaching workplace laws. Companies and their boards are on notice that we will consider the full range of enforcement options available under the Fair Work Act, including litigation where appropriate.” It is the second underpayments report from Wesfarmers in the past week, after the company’s hardware retailer Bunnings reported last week that it had underpaid superannuation for its 40,000 employees. Wesfarmers confirmed the industrial division underpayment was larger than the Bunnings underpayment, because most Bunnings staff were underpaid less than $200 in total. Guardian Australia reported in July that members of senior management, including the chief executive and chief financial officer at Blackwoods, had left the organisation, but at the time it was played down by Wesfarmers as “not unusual” and part of a restructure of the organisation. Wesfarmers said the issue was unrelated.
31	It had been quiet. Too quiet. After more than two and a half days in a drug-induced coma, the Conservative party conference was slowly dying on its feet. One minister after another making a second-rate speech to a disengaged audience. Everyone in a state of denial that things could fall apart at any time. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the 66-year-old treasurer of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers, had merely been biding his time. You can just imagine how he did it: locked and loaded and buzzing with amphetamines, bursting into the international lounge with another guest. “Er, does your friend have a pass,” the security guard inquired. “Don’t you know who I am?” Geoff snapped. “You’ll never take me alive.” “Show me your pass.” “There will never be a border post here. I will not surrender.” In the life and death struggle that ensued, Psycho Geoff was finally overpowered and subdued. Police and paramedics were summoned, while a huge crowd of journalists looked on. It had been by far the most interesting thing that had happened throughout the entire conference. Thirty minutes later, Geoff was sent home. On the proviso he didn’t tell any other MPs, otherwise they’d all be getting tooled up. Anything to get away. Less than an hour after one of the party’s senior MPs had been brought to heel by a gang of coppers and kicked out, the afternoon session on law and order began in the main hall. Sometimes the political sketch can only be a transcription service. Last year’s conference break-out star, Geoffrey Cox, had been billed to speak but the attorney general has since been exiled for giving the government duff legal advice and the audience had to make do with the more mediocre talent of junior minister Kit Malthouse. “The 20,000 increase in police numbers will be the biggest expansion since …” the hapless Malthouse’s voice tailed away. Since the Tories had cut police numbers by 20,000 nine years ago. Priti Patel emerged to make her first conference speech as home secretary as if she was hosting a TV awards ceremony. All sparkly eyes and Colgate smiles. Ting! It was just a shame that she fought a losing battle with the autocue. Her dimness is a thing of wonder. Sentences died away, to be followed by long pauses. There were no gags because Priti doesn’t do gags. Not effective enough. She much prefers nooses. “Today, here in Manchester, the Conservative party takes its rightful place as the Party of Law and Order in Britain once again,” she began. Er … run that past us again, Priti. Psycho Geoff on his way home to the Cotswolds in the back of a police car under armed guard. The prime minister has been accused of groping two women at the same time and channelling public funds to a woman with whom he had an affair. The government judged by the supreme court to have acted unlawfully over prorogation. The full-on search to find a way of getting round the Benn Act. Mark Francois committing crimes against his own sanity. Right now, it was harder to find someone in the Tory party without serious form. And … smile. Patel carried on. She was going to clamp down on foreigners. Because the very idea of a home secretary with immigrant parents was totally unthinkable. And she’d be chucking out Sajid Javid. Not because he had Asian parents, but because he was a bit rubbish. “When it comes to the intelligence services … what can I say?” she continued. As it happened, nothing. Intelligence and Priti aren’t often found in the same sentence. The biggest irony lay in the subtext. The bottom line was there seemed to be no law that Patel would not break to get the UK out of the EU. Boris and the constitution could have a free pass. Brexit trumped everything. Whatever it took. Even starving out the Irish. The speech wasn’t about the rule of law: it was pure populism. She just about refrained from bringing back hanging but she left it open as a possibility. That could wait till next year. Come to think of it, maybe it was time to build some amphitheatres and feed remainers to the lions. There was no place for the north London metropolitan liberal elite, Priti insisted. Her smile still intact. That didn’t sound like good news for Boris or Dominic Cummings. Not that she cared. She ended her speech with a prayer to Margaret Thatcher. Where there is love, let me sow hatred. This drew the loudest applause of the entire conference. For all her faults, Thatcher would be turning in her grave. As she left the stage, the PA system played “She’s so Priti, oh so Priti … she’s va-cant.” Psycho Geoff meanwhile contemplated his first night in solitary.

33	Mexican crooner José José specialized in heart-wrenching ballads which turned him into an icon of extreme Latin American romanticism. Since his death on Saturday, a bitter family battle for control of his body has converted his afterlife into a telenovela. José José – known as El Príncipe de la Canción, or the Prince of Song – died in Miami on Saturday. He was 71 and was known to have pancreatic cancer. At first, things all followed the celebrity death rulebook: tributes rolled in for the legendary entertainer famed for his vocal range, impeccable suits and redemptive struggle with alcohol and cocaine abuse. Social media buzzed with footage showing passengers on a Mexico City bus bursting into a spontaneous rendition of his most famous hit, El Triste, or The Sad One. But public mourning quickly gave way to fascination with a family feud, stoked by the showbiz media on both sides of the US-Mexico border. The singer, whose legal name was José Rómulo Sosa Ortiz, had been living in Miami since February 2018 with Sarita Sosa, his youngest daughter and only child from his third marriage. José Joel and Marysol Sosa, his other two children from an earlier marriage, have publicly accused Sarita of kidnapping their father, preventing him from seeing them, and manipulating him into signing over control of his life and legacy. The day after the singer’s death, the two elder siblings were filmed pleading with Sarita to tell them where their father’s body was as they visited funeral parlours around Miami, pursued by a swarm of reporters. “We have every right to see my father,” Marysol told the Mexican network TV Azteca. “My half-sister has a lot to explain to me – and to all of Mexico.” Sarita, meanwhile, gave two studio interviews in which she insisted she had never tried to block her siblings seeing their dad. “Aside from our differences, now is the time to be united,” she told the US network Telemundo. “If they come out and say something else, that’s a matter for them.” The public’s mounting obsession with the story has been further fuelled by mudslinging between prominent showbiz TV presenters accusing each other of taking sides, or paying for exclusives. Postmortem controversies are not uncommon for Mexico’s most iconic entertainers. After the singer Juan Gabriel died in 2016, rumours spread that he was still alive and that he faked his own death to escape the pressures of his fame. The whirlwind around José José calmed after the Mexican consulate in Miami confirmed that the body was in fact in a funeral parlour under the control of Sarita. But it remained unclear if José Joel and Marysol had seen their father’s body – let alone in which country he would finally be buried and who will inherit his estate.
34	That’s it from us this evening. Thanks for reading and commenting. Here’s a summary of the day’s main events: The prime minister was facing fresh questions over his links to Jennifer Arcuri after more damaging headlines this evening. The Guardian revealed that a Whitehall official who ran the scheme that granted Arcuri a coveted entrepreneur visa had worked for Boris Johnson when he was mayor. Johnson had earlier refused repeatedly to deny he had had an affair with Arcuri. The UK will put forward “very constructive and far-reaching proposals” to the EU for an alternative to the backstop, the prime minister pledged. Boris Johnson made the claim after reports suggested the UK wanted to set up border checks a few miles either side of the Irish frontier, rather than on it. Johnson distanced himself from the proposals, though he said some checks being needing to be carried out was simply the “reality”. Dublin has made clear it considers the reported border proposals unacceptable. The prime minister addressed those and a range of others issues during a host of broadcast interviews. You can see a comprehensive summary of those here. Priti Patel promised to “end the free movement of people once and for all”. The home secretary delivered her conference speech in the early evening, promising an Australian-style points system to replace the principle. The automatic early release of some prisoners is “madness”, according to the justice secretary. Robert Buckland told the Tory party conference he wants to end the system under which nearly all offenders sentenced to immediate custody are released at the midway point on licence in the community. The Conservative MP, Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, was asked to leave the conference after what the party described as a “totally unacceptable” incident. Police were called to deal with the issue on Tuesday afternoon. Dover faces losing £1bn in trade per week under a no-deal Brexit, it was claimed. Despite extensive preparations, the port’s chief executive told a fringe event he still expects to see a huge downturn. And, if you’d like to read more, my colleagues Simon Murphy and Matthew Weaver have our main story: Boris Johnson has arrived at a DUP reception at the Tory party conference, alongside the party’s leader, Arlene Foster. Here’s a clip of the home secretary, Priti Patel, setting out her desire to “end the free movement of people once and for all” during her party conference speech earlier this evening (see 5.04pm): The chancellor, Sajid Javid, has dropped the strongest hint yet that he may be about to scrap inheritance tax. At a fringe event – and on the eve of Boris Johnson’s first conference speech as prime minister – he was asked by a party member if he would consider getting rid of the “most painful tax” to affect the public. Javid hinted there could be significant reform on the horizon, and he also confirmed a budget would be held this year. He said: We’ve already made some sensible reforms in that tax but I hear what you’re saying and you’re not the only one. I shouldn’t say too much now but I understand the arguments against that tax. I do think when people pay taxes already through work, or through investments and capital gains and other taxes, there’s a real issue with then asking them on that income to pay taxes all over again. Sensible changes have already been made but it is something that is on my mind. Ireland’s deputy prime minister has rejected reports that a time-limited backstop could help solve the Brexit impasse. Simon Coveney has told RTÉ radio: If we put an actual time limit on the backstop, well then there is no onus – particularly on the UK side, potentially – to find alternative solutions to the backstop that may be more permanent because it will simply fall after a certain period of time. So, if you’re talking about a backstop and, if you can’t credibly answer the question: What happens on the border question at the end of it, of that time limit? Well, then it’s not a backstop at all. It was claimed earlier in the afternoon that EU27 governments had privately discussed offering the time limit. Bloomberg cited unnamed sources in the report and a European commission spokesman was quoted as saying: The EU is not considering this option at all. We are waiting for the UK to come forward with a legally operational solution that meets all the objectives of the backstop. There are fresh questions for Boris Johnson this evening, after the Guardian reveals that a Whitehall official who ran the scheme that granted Jennifer Arcuri a coveted entrepreneur visa had worked for Johnson when he was mayor of London. My colleagues, Simon Murphy and Matthew Weaver, write that Arcuri – who is at the centre of a conflict of interest row over her friendship with Johnson – beat nearly 2,000 applicants to gain one of 200 sought-after tier 1 entrepreneur visas on the government’s Sirius programme after Johnson helped promote her firm, Innotech, by giving keynote speeches at her events. They add: The Guardian has learned that Paola Cuneo, the then director of the Sirius programme, previously spent two-and-a-half years working in a senior post at London &amp; Partners (L&amp;P), the official mayoral promotional agency which Johnson had responsibility for while he was in City Hall. Cuneo, Arcuri and Johnson attended the same Innotech event in October 2013, two months before the company joined the Sirius scheme. A whistleblower has told the Guardian: Innotech stood out compared to other startups in the programme, which had a much higher potential to scale up … I could not understand why we were giving so much attention and extra funds to Innotech. Earlier this evening, Johnson refused three times to deny having an affair with Arcuri during an interview with Sky News. Boris Johnson posted this on Twitter earlier, in a reference to the video showing an aide snatching a coffee cup from his hands because it was disposable. Now there has been a run on those mugs, Sky’s Aubrey Allegretti reports. That’s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. Speaking at a debate about gang-related violence, Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, was asked about the effects of Conservative party voters’ “after-dinner activities” (aka taking cocaine) on rising violent crime rates. After it was clarified that “after-dinner activities” did not refer to the groping allegations against Boris Johnson, Duncan Smith said it needed to be pointed out that “the consequences of buying illegal drugs is that somebody dies”. He said: You didn’t pull the trigger, you didn’t stab them, but the money you gave them has gone up the chain and has been used to buy the guns and knives and to pay off the kids that are doing the violent crime, so I think that’s a very simple message to give. Yes of course we can crack down on the symptoms of that, which are criminal behaviour and violence, but the truth is you can crack down on your behaviour by saying: ‘I’m not going to do this any longer because I can’t bear the thought that somebody out there gets abused, killed or doesn’t make it to 22 because I was too busy indulging myself.’ Shaun Bailey, the Tory party’s London mayoral candidate, added that it was not just people in the Tory shires who used cocaine, but also in Labour-voting London. “Actually, most coke is sold in London,” he said. “It’s a bigger market and it’s sold in all the cool places. It isn’t just shire Tories [taking] coke. I’m sorry, it’s not who [takes] it. It’s the cool people who [take] it.” And in an interview with the BBC, Boris Johnson has said the UK will put forward some “very constructive and far-reaching proposals” to the EU for an alternative to the backstop. Johnson said there would have to be new customs checks on the island of Ireland, away from the border. If the EU is going to insist on on customs checks as we come out as it is, then we will have to accept that reality. And there will have to be a system for customs checks away from the border. Now, we think those checks can be absolutely minimal and non-intrusive and won’t involve new infrastructure. (The EU would say that it is the UK creating the need for customs checks, by leaving the customs union.) Johnson said it was preferable to have customs checks on north/south trade (ie between Northern Ireland and Ireland) than on east/west trade (ie, between Northern Ireland and Great Britain). He explained: Just to set this in context for you, it’s important to understand that trade north/south of the border is dwarfed by trade east/west, ie from Northern Ireland to GB. So it would be wrong to, as it were, to keep Northern Ireland in a customs union with the EU and to create new checks down the Irish Sea for customs. But the UK is proposing to accept an all-island zone for agrifoods, which would mean sanitary and phytosanitary checks taking place in the Irish Sea, on goods travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland, not for goods crossing the Ireland/Northern Ireland border. There are some of these checks in place alredy, but Johnson acknowledged that under his plan there would be more. He said: Insofar as we’ve made a big move on sanitary, which we have, then that will logically imply some more checks down the Irish Sea. But we think that’s liveable with, provided it’s done in the right way. The full transcript of the interview with Laura Kuenssberg is here. In an interview with Sky News, Boris Johnson has refused three times to deny having an affair with Jennifer Arcuri, the businesswoman whose company received sponsorship from a mayoral fund when Johnson was in City Hall. Opposition parties might have won their battle to keep the Commons in session while the Conservative conference is taking place, but they can’t as yet agree on everything – particularly on the idea of a possible government of national unity. All the parties believe that if Boris Johnson tried to force a no-deal Brexit then their tactic of last resort would be a no-confidence vote, replacing him with an interim PM. However, while the Liberal Democrats insist it cannot be Corbyn, Labour say he is the only choice. Speaking to reporters at parliament, Labour’s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said he hoped Jo Swinson could change her mind: I was brought up a Catholic and I am a great believer in the powers of conversion. But the Lib Dem leader argues that the Corbyn option is simply impossible, as he would not win the support of rebel former Conservative MPs and others whose votes would be needed. A spokesman for Swinson said: Jo is a great believer in the power of mathematics. Jeremy Corbyn does not have the numbers and needs to make clear who he would support if we need an emergency government. There is wider disagreement. While the Lib Dems are seeking a cross-party temporary government led by a backbench grandee, such as Ken Clarke or Harriet Harman, Corbyn’s office have called for a “strictly time-limited caretaker administration”, a Labour-only government in office for a matter of days purely to extend the Brexit deadline and call an election. The assumption is that if the alternative was no deal, one side would blink, but it remains to be seen who, and when. That was the third most important speech at this conference. Technically Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, outranks Priti Patel, the home secretary, in cabinet, but Raab was given a low-profile slot on Sunday and his speech was under-powered. Patel’s speech was probably the most rightwing by a Tory home secretary at least since Michael Howard’s “prison works” one in 1993. In policy terms, it was relatively light. There were three main announcements, but they all have so little money attached they are virtually cost-free: a fund to allow up to 60% of officers to be equipped with tasers (£10m); more activity to tackle county line drugs gangs (£20m); and a safer streets fund (£10m). But what it lacked in policy heft, it made up for in rhetorical overkill. It may not seem necessary to say that the Tories are against “gang leaders, drug barons, thugs and terrorists”, but Boris Johnson reportedly decided to make Patel home secretary because her no-nonsense authoritarianism makes her popular with party members. It remains to be seen if the public at large will react in the same way. More interesting were her constant references to the need to obey the will of the people. (See 4.01pm.) She sounded like someone who would be happy to see parliamentary democracy replaced with a more direct form of democracy, bypassing the need for parliamentarians exercising their judgment. If the Brexit party ever takes power, their ministers will give speeches like this. Patel got her loudest applause when she invoked Margaret Thatcher. Margaret Thatcher knew that if you made the British people your compass, if you took time to understand their lives and their priorities, then your direction would always be true. This suited Patel’s “will of the people” agenda, but in historical terms it was totally wrong. Thatcher would probably have loved this speech. But she was a conviction politician who knew that, if you just use British people as your compass, you will be all over the place because people keep changing their minds. Patel’s vision – almost government-by-plebiscite – was certainly not hers. And here is the peroration. This party, our Conservative party, is backing those who put their lives on the line for our national security. So as we renew our place as the party of law and order in Britain, let the message go out from this hall today: To the British people - we hear you. To the police service - we back you. And to the criminals, I simply say this: We are coming after you. Conservative party conference day three – as it happened Patel praises Margaret Thacher. Only the Conservative party is driven by the people’s priorities and that means backing our police, our communities and our great country. That pragmatic approach, grounded in the good sense of the British people, keeps us focused on what truly matters today. That’s the lesson I took from the person who inspired me to join our party. A Conservative prime minister first elected 40 years ago, this year. Margaret Thatcher knew that if you made the British people your compass, if you took time to understand their lives and their priorities, then your direction would always be true. “My policies,” she said, “are based not on some economics theory, but on things I and millions like me were brought up with: an honest day’s work for an honest day’s pay; live within your means; pay your bills on time; and support the police.” That advice is as sound today as it was 40 years ago. Patel criticises Labour. This daughter of immigrants needs no lectures from the north London metropolitan liberal elite. That’s what you get with a government that is driven by the people’s priorities. Of course, there will be only two dissenting voices: Diane Abbott and Jeremy Corbyn. Because the choice isn’t just who the people want to be our next prime minister. It’s also about who the people want to be their next home secretary. Do we really want a Labour home secretary who would leave our communities and our country less safe? Patel says the Brexit referendum result must be honoured. She praises Boris Johnson’s role in the campaign. And she turns to immigration. As home secretary at this defining moment in our country’s history, I have a particular responsibility when it comes to taking back control. It is to end the free movement of people once and for all. Instead we will introduce an Australian-style points-based immigration system. One that works in the best interests of Britain. One that attracts and welcomes the brightest and the best. One that supports brilliant scientists, the finest academics and leading people in their fields. And one that is under the control of the British government. Patel says the third reason for backing the police is because that is what people want. This is a government driven by the people’s priorities. Hardworking, honest, law-abiding people whose needs are humble, whose expectations are modest and whose demands of their government are simple. They want us to listen. They ask us to respond. And they expect us to do what we say. From crime, to immigration, to leaving the European Union, we are ready to listen and to do what they want. It’s called democracy. That shouldn’t really be a controversial statement. They are the masters and we are their servants. Patel says she is announcing a £20m fund to tackle county lines drug gangs and a £25m safer streets fund. She says she will set up a fund to allow police chiefs to equip their officers with tasers. She also says she is establishing a police covenant. I have been humbled by the officers I have met and the experiences they have shared with me. This is why I have personally accelerated work to establish the police covenant. This is a pledge to do more as a nation to help those who serve our country. To recognise the bravery, the commitment and the sacrifices of serving and former officers. And we will enshrine this into law. Second, says Patel, the police need support “to remove the grip gangs and organised criminals have on our communities”. She goes on: They just don’t care who they hurt or abuse. The kingpins of these criminal gangs are exploiting children. Forcing them to carry crack cocaine and heroin across rural and coastal communities. Threatening them into carrying guns and knives as “protection”. Manipulating them into killing innocent people. Faced with this new and growing danger, our police will know that I will back them to get this under control. Patel says more officers are being recruited, and she has given the police more powers over stop and search. There are three reasons: Firstly, because backing the forces of law and order is central to our DNA as Conservatives. Giving people the security they need to live their lives as they choose is an essential part of our freedom. We recognise that freedom and security are not opposites, but equals. And that ensuring people can live their lives free from fear is the essential foundation for a life of liberty. Here is the opening quote. Today, here in Manchester, the Conservative party takes its rightful place as the party of law and order in Britain once again. We stand with the brave men and women of our police and security services. And we stand against the criminals. The gang leaders, drug barons, thugs and terrorists who seek to do us harm. We say that proudly and without apology. As the party that has always backed the forces of law and order, and we always will. Priti Patel, the home secretary, is speaking now. She starts by saying the Conservatives have restored their reputation as the party of law and order. The Conservatives have said that Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown has been asked to leave the conference after the incident earlier. (See 2.58pm.) The party said he had tried to take someone into the international lounge who did not have the relevant pass. That person was stopped by a member of staff. Clifton-Brown then “remonstrated” with the staff member, leading to security being called. A party spokesman said: The incident was totally unacceptable. Geoffrey has been asked to leave conference and we are establishing all of the facts to see if further action is necessary. We will always adopt a zero tolerance approach to any inappropriate behaviour towards our hardworking staff. In 2015 Michael Gove was justice secretary and, in his speech to the Tory conference, he questioned the need to keep some prisoners in jail and stressed the importance of rehabilitation. The Daily Express hated the speech (always a good sign, if you’re a progressive), but my colleague Martin Kettle wrote a column saying liberals should be cheering Gove on. Four years on, and the wheel has turned full circle. Robert Buckland is now justice secretary and, although he has never been seen as an arch-authoritarian, Boris Johnson has an election to win and the Tories are back in favour of locking more people up. As my colleague Jamie Grierson reports in his preview, Buckland announced plans to stop violent and sex offenders in England and Wales being automatically released halfway through their jail sentence Here is Jamie’s story. And here is an extract from Buckland’s speech. Some form of earlier release has its place in the criminal justice system. It can be used to incentivise good behaviour. But this is not the system we have, conference. There used to be a tougher system. But in 2005, Labour replaced it with automatic release at the halfway point. It didn’t matter to Labour if prisoners posed a risk to the public. It didn’t matter to Labour if prisoners misbehaved in prison. It didn’t matter to Labour if criminals didn’t show remorse. This is madness. From my colleague Peter Walker During leaders’ questions in the Dáil, Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach, was asked about RTÉ’s leak of the UK’s government’s plan (or non-plan - see 1.23pm) for customs clearance sites away from the border on the island of Ireland. He said he had not seen the “non-paper” from the UK, but he was glad Boris Johnson had rejected it. I’m conscious when answering your question that I am talking about non-papers that I haven’t seen. I was aware of their existence, and it was public knowledge in the last week or two, that the UK provided non-papers to the EU taskforce on the basis of confidentiality and not to be shared with member states. I very much welcome Boris Johnson’s words today when he disowned the non-papers. Had he not, in my view, it would be hard evidence of bad faith by the UK government. Varadkar said he expected the UK government to honour promises to avoid border checks. The UK government promised no hard border or associated controls or checks and we expect the British government to honour that promise made in the withdrawal agreement. People here don’t want a customs border between north and south and no British government should seek to impose customs posts against the will of the people on the island of Ireland. I’m interested in what Northern Ireland businesses have to say, in what retailers say. The UK has not been listening to businesses: the Freight Trade Association say it contradicts all their advice to the government; Manufacturing NI rejected them out of hand. I would ask anyone to listen to the voices of Northern Ireland, from businesses to farmers, to people, who are saying no to customs posts, and we are saying no too. He also suggested Johnson did not appreciate the case for the backstop. Referring to his conversation with Johnson at a recent UN meeting in New York, Varakdar said Johnson has spoken about the need for no checks at the border, but had not explained where they would take place. It is his [Johnson’s] view that the UK should leave the EU whole and entire, to use his language, to leave the customs union. As I explained to him in New York, there is a reason we came up with the deal that we did after two years with Mrs May and what the backstop provides for is a single customs territory. That satisfied our demand and desire that there not be customs checks north and south, or east and west, and that’s why we came up with the backstop, why it is the best solution. We spent two years going up and down rabbit holes, because we needed a solution that avoided customs posts. This is what the Press Association has filed about the incident at the conference earlier that led to security being called and part of the venue being cordoned off. A senior Tory MP is understood to have clashed with security at the Conservative party conference, prompting a lockdown of part of the venue. Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown was involved in what a doorman described as a “small misunderstanding” at the International Lounge in the conference centre. Police said an attendee tried to enter the lounge without the relevant pass, leading security staff to intervene. PA understands Clifton-Brown was trying to enter the room with a guest. The “misunderstanding” led to a lockdown of some areas, including the press room, at the Manchester Central Convention Centre for around 20 minutes. The Cotswolds MP told the PA news agency: “I’ve got nothing further to say about it. I don’t want to comment on it, really.” A staff member guarding the door of the International Lounge said the incident was sparked by a disagreement. “It was a small misunderstanding,” the man said. Greater Manchester police said in statement: “At around 1.45pm on Tuesday 1 October 2019, an attendee to the Conservative party conference attempted to enter the International Lounge area of the conference without the relevant pass. “Security staff intervened and resolved the situation without any breach of security occurring.” Customs infrastructure even 5 miles from the Irish border risked breaking Brexit laws passed by the House of Commons this year, parliament has been told. In oral questions in the House of Commons, the Labour MPs Pat McFadden and Angela Eagle raised section 10 (2) (b) of the Withdrawal Act 2019. It states categorically that there can be no “border arrangements between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after exit day which feature physical infrastructure, including border posts, or checks and controls, that did not exist before exit day and are not in accordance with an agreement between the United Kingdom and the EU”. McFadden told James Durridge, who was taking questions for the government, that it had “obligations to abide by the law”. He asked: Would he regard such physical infrastructure a few miles back from the border as incompatible with the legislation that this house has passed? Durridge replied: “I will write to the honourable gentleman original - and confirm what I think is the bleeding obvious.” The point made by Labour backbenchers is one that has also raises concerns with Peter Hain, the Labour former Northern Ireland secretary, who said it it would be “the achilles heel” of government plans to dodge commitments in Theresa May’s deal. The incident that led to a part of the conference centre being closed and police being called involved the Conservative MP Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, my colleague Rowena Mason reports. Clifton-Brown is treasurer of the Conservative 1922 Committee. We are still waiting for a full statement from the party. The government cannot rely on European Union law to override the act of parliament forcing Boris Johnson to seek an extension to Brexit talks, a former EU senior legal adviser has said. Jean-Claude Piris, a former head of the EU council legal service, said suggestions the government could rely on EU law to trump the Benn Act had no legal basis. In emailed comments to the Guardian he said: EU law is far from always having direct effect. In the case of article 50, the decision of a member state to leave the EU must be taken in conformity with the constitutional requirements of that state. Thus no direct effect. The authorities to judge if British constitutional requirements are being respected are the British competent ones. He was responding to suggestions from the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, that EU law could be used to override the Benn Act, which mandates the prime minister to seek an extension if no Brexit deal has been agreed by 19 October. Raab, who served a four-month stint as Brexit secretary before resigning over Theresa May’s deal, hinted the government was looking at article 50 to override the Benn Act, in a recent interview with the Mail on Sunday. Here is Boris Johnson telling Channel 4 News that he does not know why he has not been scheduled to do an interview with them today. Presumably Channel 4 is still in the doghouse after Dorothy Byrne, its head of news, used the MacTaggart lecture at Edinburgh to call Johnson a “known liar”. From LBC’s Alex Cadier We’ve been told by party sources that there has been an “incident” at the Conservative party conference. A small area between the press area and the hall has been closed off and police are in attendance. The party is due to issue a statement soon. At the moment that’s all we know. But officials don’t seem particularly alarmed, and away from the cordoned off area everything is carrying on as normal, so at the moment it does not appear too serious. Despite extensive preparations at Dover, the port’s chief executive said it still expects to see a drop in trade worth £1bn a week should Britain leave the EU without a deal. Addressing a ConservativeHome/Port of Dover fringe event at the conference, the transport minister George Freeman confirmed the government was assuming that disruption would roughly halve the traffic on Britain’s main trading link for three months; the drop would range from 40% to 60%. Doug Bannister, the chief executive of Port of Dover, said the assumed drop in traffic would cut £1bn in trade every week. He said: That’s how critical it is. If there’s a no-deal Brexit, it’s not going to be OK. But people are doing all they can to ensure Britain keeps trading. Freeman said he hoped goodwill would prevail should a deal not be agreed by 31 October. Asked what preparations the government was making for “malign interventions”, such as a potential blockade by French fishermen, Freeman said he had seen cabinet papers showing “the Ministry of Defence are actively looking at it”, raising the potential for alarming escalation. The Freight Transport Association said its preparations meant it did not expect “wholesale meltdown” but people could expect to see less fresh produce. James Hookham, the deputy chief executive of the FTA, said: “There will be changes to what people can expect to see in the shops undoubtedly.” He said the FTA was holding 140 training sessions in the next few weeks to educate hauliers about the potential paperwork needed. But he said questions still remained unanswered, even in an intricate flowchart issued by the Department for Transport to explain customs and border processes. He said: The biggest unknown in our book is what the French and EU will demand in terms of British goods imported into the EU. With delays of up to five days forecast for hauliers doing return border crossings, Hookham said he had advised hauliers to take out additional insurance for cargo, especially perishable goods. He also said the full impact of a no-deal Brexit on Dover, Calais and Kent would probably not be seen until at least Monday 4 November, due to a long weekend in much of Europe, starting with a public holiday on 1 November (a celebration unrelated to Britain’s departure from the EU). James Duddridge, the Brexit minister, has just told MPs in the Commons that the EU will get formal proposals from the UK for an alternative to the backstop before the end of the week. At the Tory conference there is an expectation that the plans will be submitted to the EU tomorrow. From Channel 4 News’ Jon Snow In the Commons James Duddridge, a Brexit minister, is responding to an urgent question about the Irish border and the RTÉ leak about the government’s plans. He said the RTÉ story was not true. Responding to the UQ, which was tabled by Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, Duddridge said: There is no intention to have physical checks at the border. I’m not choosing my words carefully there – there are no plans to do that, I can reassure him. I do know he was perhaps thinking about the reports in the Northern Ireland press that were suggesting there might be checks near the border? That is not the intention, those reports simply are incorrect. As my colleague Jennifer Rankin reports, EU sources have confirmed that the RTÉ report did reflect a plan set out in a “non-paper” submitted to the EU by the British. The whole point about a “non-paper” is that it allows a government to float an idea in negotiations without that proposal being treated as an official proposal from the body submitting it. That means it would be accurate for a journalist to describe one of these as a proposition put forward by the government - but also accurate for the government to say this was not an official proposal. This might help to explain why the government’s attempts to rebut the RTÉ story this morning have been inconsistent. At one point Boris Johnson suggested the report applied to a proposal that was out-of-date. (See 8.09am.) At another point he said the report, or at least its reference to a string of border posts away from the actual border, was just wrong. (See 11.13am.) Boris Johnson’s hopes of entering into intensive Brexit negotiations next week are likely to be dashed after his backing for a customs border on the island of Ireland was criticised in Berlin as being a green light for the return of a hard border, my colleagues Daniel Boffery and Jennifer Rankin report. This morning Boris Johnson criticised his Labour successor as London mayor, Sadiq Khan, for spending too much money on press officers. But, according to the Mirror, Johnson’s own spending on PR was higher. Newsnight’s Nicholas Watt has written a good blogpost about Boris Johnson’s plans for an alternative to the backstop. He is not optimistic about a deal. Here’s an extract. EU sources are withering about the UK proposals. One told me: “Their [the UK] idea for customs land checks are no different from what would happen in no deal.” The source sees little chance of a deal on the basis of the proposals floated by Mr Johnson’s most senior EU adviser, David Frost. “We have been told by people we take seriously that Boris Johnson wants a deal,” the source told me. “But we do not see how a deal can be done.” Sajid Javid, the chancellor, has been taking Treasury questions in parliament this morning. The Commons is sitting, of course, because the normal conference recess was cancelled after the government lost a vote last week. In response to a question from the Tory MP Philip Hollobone, Javid said the UK would no longer owe the EU £39bn if it left without a deal. Hollobone asked for an assurance that the UK would be able to keep the money in a no-deal situation. And Javid replied: The £39bn is based on a deal. If there is no deal and we end up leaving with no deal that 39bn number is no longer relevant. Javid may be right to say the exact £39bn figure (a UK government assessment of how much it would pay under the complicated formula in the withdrawal agreement) would not be relevant under a no-deal Brexit. But government officials believe much or most of this money would still have to be paid, because the financial obligations would still be outstanding. The Labour MP Helen Hayes asked Javid if he was confident that hedge funds shorting the pound, “some of which have donated to the prime minister’s leadership campaign and to the Conservative party, have no inside information about the planning or timing of a no-deal Brexit”. Javid replied: That really is such a ridiculous suggestion and it doesn’t deserve an answer. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has said that some of the 21 Tories who lost the whip after rebelling over Brexit last month could be readmitted to the parliamentary party. In an interview for Moggcast, his ConservativeHome podcast, he said: I always believe in politics in being as generous as you possibly can be. But you cannot have a situation where people are trying to put Jeremy Corbyn in charge of the order paper. So, look, if they are willing to show that they are willing to support a Conservative government deliver a Conservative programme, and pull back from what they did before, I think generosity is in the nature of conservatism, and the Conservative party is a broad church and needs to remain a broad church ... So how do we get on from here? Well, let’s see if there are any other votes which give them the chance to come back, but I think a number of them are retiring and have no interest in coming back, so it won’t be everybody. He also said there was no obvious way in which the government would be able to get around the Benn Act, which is designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Asked about potential flaws in the legislation, he replied: The law is the law as it is. There is the very important question of how it interacts with EU law, but there is no easy and obvious loophole that I can sit here and tell you we can use, because if there is I haven’t spotted it. This morning’s conference business - including a session on communities, with contributions from Tory metro mayors Andy Street and Ben Houchen, and Iain Dale in conversation with Lord Dobbs - has not been much of a crowd puller. A man has been detained by police after pouring a flammable liquid over himself near the Houses of Parliament, the Press Association reports. The incident unfolded at around 10.45am and the Metropolitan police said the man was being assessed. The London Ambulance Service also attended. The Tory MP Huw Merriman posted this on Twitter. Ian Blackford, the Scottish National party’s leader at Westminster, has said the leaked border plans show Boris Johnson is not serious about getting a Brexit deal. In a statement he said: Boris Johnson’s leaked proposals show the Tory leader is not serious about getting a deal - and is aiming to take Scotland and the UK off a no-deal Brexit cliff. For all the bluster, the proposals just aren’t credible. By fixating on its extreme Brexit obsession, the Tory government is recklessly putting the Good Friday agreement at risk - and would inflict lasting harm on jobs, living standards, public services and the economy across the UK. Here is more on exactly what Boris Johnson said this morning about potential customs arrangements in Northern Ireland. (See 9.52am.) On the Today programme Nick Robinson said the RTÉ leak suggested there would be a string of border posts, not on the Irish border, but not far away. Asked if that was untrue, Johnson replied: Yes. That’s not what we are proposing at all. Johnson said he did not want to discuss his proposals until they had been shared properly with the EU. But he said he was not talking about a “hard border” just a few miles away from the actual border. He said: There are very good reasons why that would not be a good idea. I think everybody familiar with the situation in Ireland can understand why, both for practical reasons and for reasons of sentiment that we totally, totally understand. Robinson said that some in Ireland, like Sinn Féin (see 10.29am), thought there should be no checks at all on the island of Ireland. But other people argued that there would have to be checks somewhere if the UK was going to be in a separate economic arrangement. What did Johnson think? He replied: Well, I’m with the second group because that’s just the reality. And I think what we are coming up to now is, as it were, the critical moment of choice for us as friends and partners about how we proceed. Because in the end a sovereign, united country must have a single customs territory. And when the UK withdraws from the EU that must be the state of affairs that we have. But there are plenty of ways we can facilitate north/south trade, plenty of ways in which we can address the problem. Here are tweets from three Brussels experts on the leaked UK plan for customs sites away from the border in Northern Ireland revealed by RTÉ last night. Of course, Boris Johnson has dismissed the report – although he has said it is a “reality” that some customs checks will be needed. (See 9.52am.) From Raoul Ruparel, a former adviser on EU policy to Theresa May Peter Foster, the Telegraph’s Europe editor, has posted a Twitter thread starting here. And it ends with this. From Mujtaba Rahman, a former European commission official and the Brexit specialist for the Eurasia consultancy Mary Lou McDonald, the Sinn Féin president, told the BBC this morning that the plans for customs sites away from the border - leaked to RTÉ but subsequently dismissed by Boris Johnson as not reflecting the government’s current thinking - would amount to a return of a hard border. She said a plan like this would be unacceptable to Sinn Féin. She explained: What has been described in this document is essentially a hard border on the island of Ireland. Anything that causes there to be customs, tariffs, checks anywhere represents a hardening of the border ... Boris Johnson voted for the backstop because in a moment of perhaps rare lucidity he recognised that was the bottom line to protect the island of Ireland. I only hope he returns to that position. Here are the main points from Boris Johnson’s three broadcast interviews this morning. Johnson played down the row generated by the leak of UK plans for customs clearance sites in Northern Ireland and Ireland, away from the border, by saying these particular proposals were out-of-date. (See 8.09am.) He said there were “very good reasons” why it would not be a good idea just to move border checks away from the border. But he said it was a “reality” that some checks would be needed to create a “single customs territory” for the UK once it leaves the EU. Johnson would not say exactly what the UK was proposing as an alternative to the backstop, but he said the plans would be presented to the EU very soon. He implied that he might know by the weekend whether or not a deal with the EU will be achievable. He was asked about a story saying this in the Financial Times (paywall). It says: Mr Johnson’s allies say they expect Britain to submit to Brussels its formal proposals for a Brexit deal — in legal text — after the prime minister closes the Conservative party conference in Manchester. In his speech to party activists, the prime minister is expected to declare the controversial “Irish backstop” dead, challenging the EU to accept the new British proposal or face the prospect of a disorderly no-deal Brexit. “By the end of the week everyone will know whether a deal is possible,” said one ally. One cabinet minister said: “If the EU starts to leak and brief against us, that would be a very bad sign.” Asked about this story, Johnson did not reject its premise. He replied: What we will be doing is giving our friends a proposal, we think it’s a good proposal. Clearly, if there is no way of getting it over the line from their point of view, we will have to live with that. He said he had not asked EU countries to veto a Brexit extension. At the weekend he fuelled speculation that this was his strategy by refusing to say whether or not he had done this. Today, asked directly if he was asking EU leaders to refuse an article 50 extension, as the Times is reporting, he replied: We haven’t. In truth, we have not made any such request. But Johnson did not rule out making such a request in future. He implied that the EU would regret keeping the UK in. Asked directly if the UK was threatening to cause trouble if forced to remain a member, he did not reject the idea, and said the EU was doing things that were not in the interests of the UK. (See 8.21am.) He claimed that misconduct allegations against him were being raised now as part of a bid to frustrate Brexit. Asked about the Jennifer Arcuri and Charlotte Edwardes allegations, and why they were surfacing now, he replied: I think there’s a very good reason, and that is that I’ve been tasked one way or the other to get Brexit done by October 31. And there are quite a lot of well-meaning and highly intelligent people who basically think that that would be something they don’t want to see, and I think that there is a concerted effort now to frustrate Brexit. At another point he said: You asked me about why is all this shot and shell raining down on the government – I think it is because we’re going to get on and deliver Brexit by October 31. He claimed Sadiq Khan, the current Labour mayor of London, was involved in keeping the Arcuri story in the news. He said it was “very sad” that Charlotte Edwardes had accused him of groping her at a lunch 20 years ago. Commenting on her allegations, he said: I’ve said what I’ve said about that. They are not true. It’s obviously very sad that someone should make such allegations - they are not true. He rejected claims he had a “women problem”, claiming that he had been “a big champion of women” as London mayor and as foreign secretary. He said he had never heard of the BBC presenter Naga Munchetty, who has been at the centre of major row over complaints that her comment about Donald Trump using racist language breached editorial guidelines. This story has been headline news, on the BBC and elsewhere, for days. But when Johnson was asked if he thought Munchetty had done anything wrong, he replied: I am so sorry, I have never heard of her. When the LBC presenter Nick Ferrari expressed astonishment at this, Johnson went on: You’re going to have to forgive me. I should know about Naga Munchetty. He described a claim by his sister Rachel that he was being influenced by hedge fund donors who stood to gain millions from a no-deal Brexit as “absolute nonsense”. He revived suggestions that the MPs who drafted the Benn Act designed to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October may have had foreign help. Asked about the decision by unnamed No 10 sources to accuse them of “collusion”, he said: I think there is a legitimate question to be asked about the generation of this SO24 legislation. It is a very interesting situation. We have bills and an act - the so-called surrender act - that I’m afraid has a massive consequence for the people and economy of this country were it to be effected. We have no knowledge of how it was produced. It is not subject to normal parliamentary scrutiny. No one knows by whose advice or legal advice it was drawn up. He claimed he was still the “generous-hearted ... one nation Tory” he was when he was London mayor. When it was put to him that many of his previous supporters were alarmed at how he seemed to have changed as a politician since becoming PM, he replied: I say to all those who wish to see a return of the old generous-hearted, loving mayor of London and all the rest of it, that person has not gone away. I am a one nation Tory. But we are in a position where the only way we can take this country forward and unite our country again is to get Brexit done. That’s what we need to do. He said he was a “bus fanatic”. From the Times’s Matt Chorley Here is Boris Johnson on the set of Today. Q: Do you regret any of the language you have used? Johnson says he has to recognise that people can take offence. Q: Has your partner, Carrie Symonds, suggested you tone it down a bit? No, says Johnson. He says he persists in thinking the surrender act is an appropriate term for the Benn Act. It gives the EU the power to decide how long the UK would stay in the EU. (Actually, it doesn’t. See here, the second bullet point.) And that’s it. I will post a summary of the key points from all these interviews shortly. Johnson is now back to buses, saying they can make a huge difference to people’s lives. He wants people to be able to use contactless payments on buses across the UK. Ferrari quotes some comments from David Cameron’s book about Johnson: “paranoid ... massive irritation ... full of jealousies that influenced his behaviour.” Johnson says he has had his up and downs in his relationship with Cameron. He says he has not read Cameron’s book. Q: Did you tell David Cameron that Brexit would be crushed like a toad? Johnson says he won’t comment on private conversations. Q: So it is true. Q: What was your relationship with Jennifer Arcuri? Johnson claims this story is being pushed by the current mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. He says Khan has let knife crime out of control. Q: Did you behave improperly with Charlotte Edwardes? No, says Johnson. Q: Matt Hancock says he believes Edwardes. What do you say about that? Johnson says he is saying what he has to say. Q: Why are these stories coming out? Johnson says some intelligent people want to block Brexit. There is a “concerted effort” to stop it happening, he says. Johnson suggests misconduct allegations against him are being raised as part of an effort to block Brexit. Q: Are you saying these allegations are politically motivated? Johnson says he is getting a lot of “shot and shell” because he is trying to deliver Brexit. And it may be an attempt to distract from his domestic agenda, he says. Q: Your sister says you are backed by currency speculators who will benefit from a no-deal Brexit. Johnson says that claim is wrong. But he does not want to say more about his sister. Johnson says he does not know who Naga Munchetty is, or what the story about her being reprimanded by the BBC was all about. Q: Have you apologised to the Queen for the unlawful prorogation? Johnson says it would be wrong for him to comment on his conversations with the Queen. Q; Will you prorogue parliament again? Johnson says, to have a Queen’s speech, it is necessary to prorogue. He says he will have to check the judgment to see what is possible, but he thinks prorogation is possible. He says there will be a Queen’s speech. Johnson says Queen’s speech will go ahead. Nick Ferrari is now interviewing Boris Johnson on LBC. Q: Are you likely to die in a ditch? I hope not, says Johnson. He says he wants to get Brexit done. Q: The FT says by the weekend you will know if the EU are going to accept your deal. Johnson accepts that. But he says he hopes the EU will see some merit in the UK plan when they see it shortly. Johnson accepts that it will be clear within days whether or not a deal is possible. Q: Have you got a women problem? Johnson says he has always been a champion of women in every organisation he has run - like City Hall and the Foreign Office. As foreign secretary, he promoted education for girls. Q: What are you saying about the Charlotte Edwardes’ allegation? Johnson says he is not minimising the importance of matters like this. But this allegation is not true, he says. Q: People who used to admire you think you have changed. Are you going to carry on like this? Johnson says, the way he sees it, he has been tasked by the British people with delivering Brexit. It is a difficult job. Many people want to prevent this. But it has to be done. All those who want to see the return of the old, generous-hearted mayor of London - that person has not gone away. He is a one nation Conservative, he says. But he says the only way to unite the country is to get Brexit done. Johnson claims he remains at heart the “generous-hearted” Tory he was when he was mayor of London. And that’s it. The interview is over. Johnson makes the point about being a “bus fanatic”. Q: During the referendum you admitted that a no-deal Brexit would hit the economy. The OBR says it will be £30bn a year. So you won’t be able to afford this hospital building programme. Johnson says the money is there. In 10 years’ time there will be 40 new hospitals. Q; But you are just releasing £100m for these now. The money won’t be there if there is a no-deal Brexit. Johnson says the money is there. Johnson claims a no-deal Brexit would not derail his planned hospital building programme. Q: How did you feel when your sister Rachel criticised the language you used about your critics? Johnson says disagrees with some family members on Brexit. Q: This is not about Brexit. This is about your language. Number 10 has accused your critics of “foreign collusion”. Johnson says it is worth asking how that “surrender act” came about. We have no knowledge of how that bill was produced. It was not subject to normal parliamentary processes. Q: So it may be produced by foreign government? Johnson says he personally has not used the word “collaborators”. Q: You said collaborating. Johnson says there are different connotations to different words. He says no one knows how this bill was produced. Johnson says staying in would cost £1bn a month. Robinson says that figure is disputed - like his £350m a week figure on the Vote Leave bus. Johnson says that figure would be higher now. Q: Are you asking EU leaders to rule out a Brexit extension? Johnson says he has not made any such request. But he says he thinks EU leaders do want this sorted. Q: You told Andrew Marr that the EU would not want the UK to stay as a “truculent” member. Are you threatening bad behaviour if we stay? Johnson says people want to leave. He says he does not think any purpose is achieved by keeping the UK in against its will. Q: Dominic Raab says we won’t “play nice” if we stay. Are you threatening to muck things up if kept in? Johnson says the EU is doing things that are not in the interests of the UK. Q: So you will veto things they want? Johnson says the EU see the UK as a great power. We have spent three years arguing about leaving. They want to see us leaving, and a positive relationship with us. He goes on: I am a pro-European. I actually love Europe. Q: There are people who say you don’t want a deal. And look where your money comes from. Your donors do not want a deal? Johnson says this is the inverse of reality. He wants a deal. But there are limits. There is a limit to how much a sovereign country can compromise on customs. On sanitary and phytosanitary plans for Ireland, he has already moved “a long way”. He says he does not think people in the UK have recognised quite how much the UK has moved on this. Johnson claims UK has already compromised more on backstop than people realise. Nick Robinson is interviewing Boris Johnson on Today. Q: Will you be ringing EU leaders today about your plans? Johnson says he has been making calls. He has seen some leaked plans, possibly leaked by Brussels, that are not quite right. Q: So the report about having customs clearances sites away from the border are not true? Johnson says that is correct. It would not make sense to have a new border away from the border. Q: But people say there have to be checks somewhere? Johnson says he accepts that. He says the UK is coming up to the point of decision. A single, united country must have its own customs territory. But there are lots of ways of doing this. There are ways of protecting the customs area. Robinson says Johnson can come back and discuss his plans when they are published. Johnson does not reject the idea. This is what Boris Johnson told BBC Breakfast about the plan for customs clearance sites away from the Northern Ireland border leaked to RTE. As far as I can make out from what I have seen of the response from Brussels and, I think, Dublin, they are not talking about the proposals that we are actually going to be tabling. They are talking about some stuff that went in previously ... We’ve made a very good offer, we are going to make a very good offer, we will be tabling it formally very soon. Q: Did you expect this level of scrutiny? Have you enjoyed the job? Johnson says it is a wonderful job. He is motivated by the desire to tackle things like low pay. The national living wage is going up. The living wage is a fantastic thing, he says. And he says it works for employers because their staff are better motivated. He says he does not want to minimise things like sexual misconduct (my terms, not his). But in this case the allegations are not true. He says he loves buses. He is a “bus fanatic”. He says, if you put contactless payment on buses, you will get more cars off the road. And that’s it. Q: Do people trust you? Look at what we do, he says. He says he stood on the steps of Number 10 and promised more police officers and new hospitals. Those officer are being recruited, and he has published plans for 40 new hospitals, he says. Q: You don’t talk about your private life. Johnson says he intends to continue with that. Q: But what do you say about Charlotte Edwardes? Johnson says this is a difficult time. A lot of people don’t want Brexit to be done. They see Johnson as the person delivering it. So it is inevitable he will come in for a lot of “shot and shell”. He says the Edwardes’ allegations are “not true”. It is “very sad” that she has made them, she says. Q: Is that behaviour inappropriate? It is not true, says Johnson. Q: But would it be inappropriate? Yes, of course, says Johnson. Johnson says it is “very sad” that the journalist Charlotte Edwardes has made groping allegations against him that are “not true”. Johnson says the most important thing is to “bust out” of the backstop arrangements. Under the backstop, the UK would have to accept EU laws, he says. He says he wants to exploit “the freedoms that are so vital for Brexit”. And he thinks this can be done in a way that protects the Good Friday agreement, he says. Q: What else will you change about the withdrawal agreement? Will it just be Theresa May’s deal without the backstop? Johnson says getting rid of the backstop is the main goal. But he wants changes to the political declaration too. He says getting rid of the backstop will allow the UK to have an exciting relationship with the EU and the rest of the world. There is no point in leaving the EU if you stay in the customs union, bound by EU trade policy. Johnson says the UK has agreed that there should be an all-island area in Ireland for agri-foods. This would mean Northern Ireland being bound by EU sanitary and phytosanitary rules. That is a big concession from the UK, he says. Dan Walker is interviewing Boris Johnson on BBC Breakfast. Q: What are the backstop changes you are planning? Johnson says the EU and Dublin are not talking about the UK government’s final plans. They are talking about “some stuff” that was proposed earlier. He says the UK will make a “very good offer”. It will table it soon. To be a country, you need a single border. Q: So are you going to have customs sites as described? No, says Johnson. Q: So what are you planning? Johnson says he does not want to say now. Plans can get distorted. Here are the Boris Johnson interviews coming up. 7.45am - BBC Breakfast 8.10am - Today programme 8.30am - LBC Boris Johnson is doing a round of media interviews this morning, and he is bound to be asked about an important Brexit story that broke last night. The UK government is due to present the EU with detailed plans for a replacement to the backstop within days and last night the Irish broadcaster RTE published a leak of plans, saying the UK wants to have customs clearance sites in Ireland, five to 10 miles away from the border to the north and the south. The Irish government has called the plans a “non-starter”. Here is my colleague Lisa O’Carroll’s overnight story about the leak of the plans. And here is how Lisa’s story starts. Boris Johnson’s secret plans to solve the Irish border Brexit challenge involve customs sites on both sides of the border and real-time tracking devices on lorries, it has been reported. The ideas, which mark a departure from his promise not to put infrastructure on the border, are part of four unofficial papers submitted by the UK to Brussels by Johnson’s team. The broadcaster RTÉ, which has had sight of the the tightly guarded proposals, is reporting that customs clearance sites would be sited five to 10 miles from the border to the north and the south to deal with imports and exports. Traders would have the choice of lodging their papers at these sites, similar to the ones that existed before the single market came into existence, or electing to be tracked electronically in an online “transit” arrangement. Here is Tony Connelly’s full RTE story on the leaked plans. Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister and deputy prime minister, has rejected the proposals. Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, has said the plans leaked to RTE are just “preliminary documents”. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: The conference opens with a session on stronger communities, followed by a session celebrating “the Conservative party in action”, hosted by Lord Dobbs and Iain Dale. 2pm: A session on social justice in action. 2.45pm: Shaun Bailey, the Tory mayoral candidate for London, speaks. 3pm: Session on criminal justice, with speeches from Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, and 3.45pm: Priti Patel, the home secretary speaks. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing almost exclusively on the Conservative conference. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning’s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today’s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it.

35	Frank Lampard has said that Ross Barkley was naive to go on a night out in the buildup to a Champions League game after the Chelsea midfielder was involved in an argument with a taxi driver in Liverpool on Sunday. Barkley has travelled to Lille for Wednesday’s Group H game but Lampard feels it was unprofessional of the England international to be out three days before a match in which Chelsea need to respond to opening their European campaign with a home defeat by Valencia. The 25-year-old admitted he made a mistake when he spoke to Chelsea’s manager on Tuesday morning. Reports claimed that Barkley was escorted to a cash machine by two police officers after spilling chips in a taxi and refusing to give the driver money for the mess. “I don’t have to give permission on a day off to be in Liverpool,” Lampard said. “That’s not a problem. Liverpool is the least of my worries. It is only a few hours to get up there and back, especially when your family is up there. It is important for people to see them. “He hasn’t broken a club code being out 48 hours before a game. The lads were given a day off on Sunday. He hasn’t committed a crime other than eating chips in the back of a cab, which is probably a bit out of order for the cabbie, but on a serious note what he has done from my point of view is be naive to be out on that evening in the buildup to a Champions League game. “He has admitted that. On a professional level, those are little things that shouldn’t happen. I like Ross. I have had absolutely no problem with him. He works hard and wants to do well. This morning he admitted to making a mistake. I will take that at face value and we move on.” Lampard is hopeful N’Golo Kanté will start against Lille, last season’s Ligue 1 runners-up, after the midfielder missed Saturday’s win over Brighton with a hamstring injury. The 41-year-old went on to warn his players to maintain their focus at Stade Pierre-Mauroy. Chelsea paid for one defensive slip against Valencia, with their frustration compounded by Barkley’s late penalty miss, and Lampard will tell his young side that their hopes of reaching the last 16 will be in severe doubt if their concentration is not spot on. “I thought Valencia wasn’t the worst game for us,” he said. “We played OK and should have got a result. It was a harsh lesson in switching off for a second and losing a match at this level. I think that idea ramps up even more when you travel in the Champions League and play away from home at stadiums like this against top European teams. “Lille have a lot of threats to us, particularly in attacking areas where they have a lot of speed and quality. It’s not the be all and end all, as in there are four more games after this. We have to see it in the big picture. But as we sit here now with no points from the first game, it’s a game we have to be very ready for to try and pick up something.” Lampard’s faith in youth has been vindicated by the form of Fikayo Tomori, Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham this season and César Azipilicueta, one of Chelsea’s senior players, said the youngsters will need help from more experienced teammates during their first away game in the Champions League. “We have to help everybody, especially the young boys who don’t have the experience, to help them play with confidence and without fear,” the defender said. “I’m sure that experiences like tomorrow night will help them to grow and to improve and hopefully we can keep having these kind of nights for a long time.” Lille also have an inexperienced side and were beaten 3-0 by Ajax in their opening game. They have struggled for goals this season, having sold Nicolas Pépé to Arsenal in the summer, and their manager, Christophe Galtier, referred to Chelsea as a “complete team”. There could be a familiar face in Lille’s attack, with the former Chelsea striker Loïc Rémy a contender to start against his old side. The former West Ham centre-back, José Fonte, is another with Premier League experience and Galtier could also start the on-loan Bayern Munich midfielder Renato Sanches, who failed to impress on loan at Swansea two years ago.
36	Long after the final whistle had gone here, Club Brugge’s fans were still singing high in the north stand, their players back out on the pitch celebrating with them. This was a big occasion and a big result for the Belgians and yet, while there were no signs of regret, they knew it could have been even bigger. For most of a night their coach, Philippe Clement, described as “historic” they had led with two goals from Emmanuel Bonaventure, but headers from Sergio Ramos and Casemiro, the latter in the 86th minute, had seen it end level. The rest of the stadium stood empty, Madrid’s fans making their way home knowing that it could have been worse: for them too, this finishing 2-2 was a success, given where they had come from. What Madrid might have expected to be a routine victory became a rescue mission. For a long time, they had been on course for a second defeat in the Champions League that arrived in a way that could have hurt even more than the first: to begin with, this was silly at the Santiago Bernabéu, then it got worse, the home side not so much shooting themselves in the foot as blowing their entire leg off. Then the comeback came, but it remained only half-completed, avoiding defeat but not securing victory. Madrid, who have never been knocked out in the group stages, have a solitary point after two matches. It could and perhaps should have been nought. Not only were they behind until late on, they were almost caught right at the death, even though Brugge were by then down to 10 and without their captain. Brugge had been ahead from the ninth minute, although it took a further three for them to know that. Percy Tau was played in up the left and, with Madrid wide open, he put the ball across for Bonaventure who was racing through the middle. What happened next was, frankly, daft. Alone in front of goal, by the six-yard box, Bonaventure failed to control the ball properly, stumbling and watching it bounce off one leg and then the other, the chance apparently wasted. Only, it wasn’t: the ball dribbled past Thibaut Courtois, already on the floor. So slowly did it go that Madrid’s keeper might even have got up in time to prevent it crossing the line. Courtois, though, couldn’t stop it. The linesman and his referee on the other hand could. Offside was given – and accepted by just about everyone here. Tau had appeared to go unnecessarily early, and so had Bonaventure. On the touchline, Clement literally did a facepalm inspired by how foolishly they had passed up a perfect opportunity. But these are days of video, of routine checks for every goal. And the word came back: onside. Ramos had been the culprit. Brugge led. Madrid were stunned, groggy, and almost caught again. Bonaventure was away, the linesman’s flag stopping his run. This decision may have been wrong too, but Bonaventure had already put on the brakes. Madrid struggled to escape their own stupefaction. Lucas Vázquez was having an especially horrible time. So was Nacho, beaten often by Krépin Diatta. Madrid had the ball, but every time Brugge came out, they looked vulnerable. In fact, had the Belgians taken better decisions, they might have done more damage. They did enough. Luka Modric went down in the area, Toni Kroos’s volley deflected just wide, and Eden Hazard and Karim Benzema got in each other’s way. Benzema’s header was blocked and then Simon Mignolet made a sensational save from Raphaël Varane’s header. But at the other end, the threat always lingered. Courtois had to save from Pau, slipped clean through behind Nacho by Diatta’s measured pass. Kroos then put a shot fractionally wide. That was the best chance, but it was quickly followed by the second goal for Brugge, and in this too Madrid were complicit in their own demise. Modric lost the ball and Bonaventure rushed through, no one in his way as he headed towards goal. As he approached the area, Bonaventure stumbled, on the verge of falling, but he stayed upright just long enough to dink the ball over Courtois, who was already on his way down. Madrid were in pieces; the end of the first half was met with furious whistles. Zinedine Zidane acted fast: off went Nacho, replaced by Marcelo. Off too went Courtois, a substitution that some suspected was a statement, cheered by supporters, but that was in fact explained by the goalkeeper’s physical state. During the break, Courtois had been dizzy and vomiting. Alphonse Areola was almost immediately called upon to prevent Bonaventure, clean through and running from deep, from making it three. Relieved, Madrid reacted. Mignolet had made a couple of saves already when, on 55 minutes, Ramos headed in Benzema’s cross. The flag was up and Madrid’s captain looked offside, but the VAR again decided otherwise. Game on, noise up. Brugge had half an hour to hang on. Ruud Vormer flew in to block a shot from Casemiro, Vázquez bent just wide, and Hazard hit past the post from the edge of the box. Vinícius Júnior was introduced. Bonaventure was withdrawn; Brugge’s fans applauded and Madrid’s probably felt like doing the same, relieved to see him go. The impetus went too, that fury momentarily fizzing out. Vinícius ran but few real chances followed. There were 27 shots from the home side, but not the danger that number suggests. Then a challenge from Vormer, diving in, caught Vinícius on the ankle. Georgi Kabakov sent Vormer off and from the free-kick Casemiro headed Madrid level. They had six minutes to get another. When Ramos jumped with Mignolet and the ball ran free in the six-yard box, there was a sharp intake of breath, and it felt inevitable that Madrid would score. But they didn’t and in fact, it was Brugge who came closest in those dying minutes. Tau dashed through the middle yet again but did not see the option to pass opening up and was eventually bundled over. From the free-kick, deep into stoppage time, Siebe Schrijvers was suddenly alone deep inside the Madrid area. He had barely been on the pitch a few seconds and he sliced his shot wide.
37	Assassins is almost certainly the musical we deserve right now, but is it what we need? Stephen Sondheim’s musical, which premiered in 1990, sets out to decimate the American Dream but you may ask if there is anything left to decimate. With a score and lyrics by Sondheim (both brutally clever and inventive) and a snappy book from John Weidman, this is a deeply unsettling yet seductive show about a rostrum of real-life assassination attempts on US presidents, from Abraham Lincoln through to Ronald Reagan. Director Bill Buckhurst has past form with Sondheim revivals and has done a stellar job with his musician-actor ensemble. His production feels punchy, dangerous and downright brave in places. But it’s also a strangely deadening experience – one that lights up the brain but snuffs out the heart. Buckhurst and designer Simon Kenny shroud their show in a fading American flag: peeling red, white and blue paint adorns the stage walls and, in a typically flamboyant yet devastating scene, an assassin is executed using a flag-coloured noose. Amid the assassinations, a “cheery” balladeer (played with a cool yet chipper spirit by Lillie Flynn) pops up and reminds us that the bad guys do not win: “Angry men don’t write the rules/and guns don’t right the wrongs.” It’s such a brilliant line, yet there’s something almost too on-the-nose about Sondheim’s icy irony. In another bruising scene, Samuel Byck (Steve Simmonds) sits in a cramped and gloomily-lit booth. Intent on killing President Nixon, this father of four – dressed in a grubby Santa suit – barks out: “Who do we believe? Who do we trust? What do we do?” The parallels with today are almost too pertinent to bear. It’s the funny scenes that create a bit of distance and allow us to look at the dark themes from a slightly different angle. Evelyn Hoskins and Sara Poyzer are excellent as two wannabe assassins of President Ford. They guzzle coke, confess their warped fantasies and practise their aim with that most American of props – a huge bucket of cheap fried chicken. • At Watermill, Newbury, until 26 October.
38	Republicans have “decided on a new strategy” to address a whistleblower complaint against Donald Trump, joked Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee and a frequent critic of the president. Steele tweeted a slapstick video of a woman trying to sweep sand into the ocean as the tide rolled in. He was lampooning something noted by veterans of the last impeachment fight, targeting Bill Clinton, and others. One week after the Democrats opened their official inquiry, the president and his party are still improvising a defense and have yet to hit on a coherent response. “It’s as if the Trump campaign has read the Clinton playbook and at every turn opted for the opposite,” said David Frum, a conservative columnist in the 1990s who was later a speechwriter for George W Bush, writing in the Atlantic. Where Clinton tried to appeal to voters in the middle and stay focused on policy, counting on impeachment to blow over, Frum wrote, Trump is “wholly obsessed with impeachment … raving nonstop against the whistleblower, the House, and all his political foes – seen and unseen.” In the week since the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, announced impeachment proceedings, Trump has vowed to unveil the whistleblower, in defiance of federal protections; accused a Democratic committee chair of treason; quoted a prediction that impeachment would touch off civil war; elevated a false story about a supposed change to whistleblower laws; and generally asked people to believe him instead of their own eyes. “Almost everything [the whistleblower] has said about my ‘perfect’ call with the Ukrainian president is wrong,” Trump tweeted on Tuesday. In fact, the whistleblower’s description of the call, which you can read here, matches a summary of the call released by the White House, which you can read here, and those accounts both match Trump’s own summary of his communications with Ukraine. If there is a point on which Trump and Republicans contend that the whistleblower complaint is wrong on the facts, they have yet to identify it. “The only defenses we’ve heard from Trump on the Ukraine call so far are false assertions that the whistleblower had no first-hand knowledge and that the [whistleblower] form changed,” tweeted the former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti. “That’s because the transcript, on its face, establishes the offense and there’s no good excuse for it.” Defenses of the president floated by Republicans have been no less scattered than those floated by Trump himself. After a disastrous 60 Minutes appearance in which he exposed his ignorance of the White House call summary, the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, unveiled a wan numbered list of “the most important facts we have”. Among them: “The president did nothing that would be impeachable.” The minority whip, Steve Scalise, took a different tack, arguing that the impeachment inquiry was “based on false rumors [and] leftwing rage” stoked by “radicals [and] socialists” who “have taken over the Democrat [sic] Party”. But that line of messaging – that, in short, the Democrats have lost their minds – was undercut by other Republican voices who acknowledged the validity of the whistleblower complaint. Chuck Grassley, the longest-serving Republican in the Senate, released a statement on Tuesday defending the whistleblower. “This person appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected,” the Iowan said. “No one should be making judgments or pronouncements without hearing from the whistleblower first and carefully following up on the facts.” The success of Trump’s messaging strategy does not depend on coherence or convincing the pundits. Ultimately the only important audience for him is the voters. But the early numbers on that front are not encouraging for the administration. In a CNBC poll released on Tuesday morning, Trump’s approval rating had dropped to an all-time low of 37% – although it had not changed in polling averages. Clinton emerged from impeachment with buoyed poll numbers and his top Republican assailants were swept from office in the next election. First on the list of those swept aside was Newt Gingrich, who lost the House speakership, having led the charge to impeach Clinton for making false statements to investigators about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. At the time, it later emerged, Gingrich was conducting an extramarital affair of his own, with a congressional staffer. Gingrich said on Fox News on Tuesday it was outrageous for Democrats to investigate Trump for allegedly abusing the power of his office and undermining national security and election integrity by soliciting a foreign country for help in the upcoming election. “This is, in constitutional terms, a coup d’etat,” Gingrich said. “It is an effort by one branch of the government to destroy the incumbent president of the United States without any regard for the facts.”
39	Massimiliano Allegri has been learning English as the former Juventus and Milan manager targets a new role in the Premier League, with the Italian understood to be keen on taking over from Ole Gunnar Solskjær should Manchester United sack the Norwegian. Allegri, who left Juventus at the end of last season after winning a fifth consecutive Serie A title, attended Tottenham’s Champions League fixture against Bayern Munich on Tuesday night and has been sounded out by several English clubs over the possibility of moving to the Premier League in the future. In particular, the 52-year-old is believed to have identified United as a potential employer should United decide to part company with Solskjær after the club made its worst start to a league campaign for 30 years. At this stage, it is understood that United have no intention of sacking a manager who signed a three-year contract in March but Allegri is expected to be on a two or three-man shortlist should they take action in the near future. Despite his departure, the former midfielder is still contractually tied to Juventus until 2020 but that is unlikely to affect any potential move to Old Trafford, with Allegri thought to be willing to take the job even if United do not qualify for next season’s Champions League.
40	A story inspired by a brief dictionary entry about an 18th-century woman described as a “voluble hypocrite” has won Jo Lloyd the £15,000 BBC national short story award. In The Invisible, Martha, who claims she is friends with an invisible family, is living in an invisible mansion in Carnarvonshire. It opens: “Mr Ingram and his Invisible daughter Miss Ingram live close by, Martha tells us, in a grand, impractical mansion of the type the wealthy favour – except Invisible, of course – made from dressed stone the colour of spring cream, with a slate roof and glass in every window.” The Welsh writer discovered Martha’s history by chance, when looking through the online Dictionary of Welsh Biography. The dictionary says Martha “succeeded in persuading many people of that neighbourhood” of her stories – although eventually doubts began to spread. Chair of the judges and BBC broadcaster Nikki Bedi said thedecision had been unanimous. Five authors had been shortlisted: Lloyd, Lucy Caldwell, Lynda Clark, Jacqueline Crooks and Tamsin Grey. “The story is unplaceable but deeply resonant. The Invisible’s themes touch on wealth and class, what can be seen and not seen, and what’s precious and what should be valued in the world. You will read and reread it, and be richer every time,” Bedi said. Her fellow judge and the winner of the 2017 prize, Cynan Jones, said Lloyd had painted “a timelessly relevant picture of how we obsess for access to worlds we cannot have”. “It is,” he said, “also a story about story itself; our need for them, to allow us to see beyond ourselves, and how the stories we buy into can bring us together or push us apart.” Lloyd, who grew up in south Wales, received her award at a ceremony broadcast live on Radio 4 on Tuesday night. The Invisible by Jo Lloyd Across the lake Mr Ingram and his Invisible daughter Miss Ingram live close by, Martha tells us, in a grand, impractical mansion of the type the wealthy favour – except Invisible, of course – made from dressed stone the colour of spring cream, with a slate roof and glass in every window. Is that so, we say. They receive numerous Invisible guests, Martha tells us, who must travel here from other Invisible mansions, in other parts of the country. That would follow, we say. They attend fairs and sales about the district. They are regulars at our Wednesday markets. To sell or to buy? They are Invisible! To accomplish trade both parties must be visible, a fact we have not previously had cause to contemplate. Mr Ingram’s mansion, Martha tells us, stands on the other side of the lake, at the foot of the mountain. We have inspected the spot she indicates and confirmed it is in no way remarkable. Cold eels of water slide among rushes and sedges and tumps of starry moss. Cat-gorse and furze cling to rafts of drier ground. Spearwort and flag dip their toes and shiver. Not that we need to search for evidence. If there were a mansion across the lake, our dogs would be howling every time an Ingram passed by. Our daughters would be scouring their pots, our sons sweating in their stables and gardens. Some accuse Martha of fraud, although what she has to gain by it we cannot determine. Others say her wits are failing. We’ve known her put her clothes on back to front and summon her cow with the call meant for hogs. She will stop for minutes on end to watch rooks or lapwings tumble about the sky, as if they bore porridge and dates and the answers to life’s mysteries in their beaks. But most are happy, eager even, to take her at her word. We want to believe that the Invisible have, for whatever purpose, established their Invisible home next to us. It pleases us to imagine them prodding the fat rumps of our livestock, testing our grains with their clean Invisible fingernails. Tell us more, we say, and Martha dimples like a girl. There are many of them, she says. Sometimes the Invisible outnumber other visitors. But why do they come to market? For amusement, I suppose. Entertainment. We look each other up and down, wondering which of us is most entertaining. The Ingrams have called at Martha’s cottage, of an evening, to pay their respects. Miss Ingram has such pale hands, Martha says. As if she keeps them folded away in a linen chest. What language do they speak? It is English, I presume. I seem to understand some of it. But their speech is strange. Until you are very close, it’s like a noise of leaves or water. We cannot think why, of all of us, they would choose Martha. She is not the most educated or wise. Not even the most gullible. Invite us along next time they visit, says Jacob. That should sort the wheat from the goats. They wouldn’t allow it, Martha says. What are you afraid of? Jacob says. Let’s settle this once and for all. Come on Martha, we say. Let’s settle this. Unless you have reason to be afraid. I would love to see Miss Ingram’s dress, says Eliza. And her jewellery. I would love to see how she does her hair. Oh yes, we say. We’d love to see her dress and her hair and her jewellery. It’s out of the question, Martha keeps saying. They would never agree. But if there is one thing we know, it is persistence. Freckled peas The Vestry can find no regulations that apply. In the past, Martha might have been suspected of contracting with demons, but the Parliament in London has repealed the law against witchcraft. We don’t know if this is because we’ve progressed beyond such superstition or because all the witches have been drowned. Martha has never been known as a fool or a liar. Once she claimed to have seen a yellow cat the size of a two-tooth hogget at her door, but perhaps she did, and if not, anyone could make that mistake. Jacob complained that she sold him a calf that was already sick and it expired within a day, but they resolved that dispute between them. Mostly she has lived the way we all do, evenly, tidily, respecting time and season. She plants oats and beans and freckled peas on her late father’s holding, keeps bees and chickens, drives her cow to the grazings. She has no husband or children bringing home a wage from the quarry, but then she has no one for whom she must buy tea and sugar. She is a hard worker, if a slow one. When she was a baby her mother, Rebecca, stumbling, as we understand, let her fall in the hearth. In the moments it took the parents to react, flames bit through the swaddling, gnawed the tender infant limbs. We found Rebecca later in the church porch, hanged dead. Martha was left with a limp and, in her breath, a hiss as of hot ashes settling. But she is not one to make excuses. She salts her own bacon, gathers her own turf and bark. She has a reputation as a pickler and preserver, putting up the greater part of her harvest and whatever she collects from woods and wastes. She’s able to sell her surplus to lazier households. She is careful with her animals, keeping them clean and dry. In hard winters, she stints herself to feed them. Plump and handsome Martha is adamant that the Invisible are not the Tylwyth Teg, who are known to be short and ill-favoured. The Ingrams are as tall as we are, she points out. Taller. They’re plump and handsome. Also the Tylwyth Teg are spiteful. They bear grudges for generations. They hide robins’ eggs in shoes, crumble owl pellets into the flour. The Invisible, Martha says, are smiling always, and if they are not smiling they are laughing. They are generous. Once I saw Miss Ingram pick up a fallen kit and place it back with its fellows. But on further questioning, she admits such acts of charity are rare. Mostly the Invisible keep apart, chattering among themselves. How do they dress? It is the fashion of the city, I suppose, all bright colours and embroidery. And everything always new. Not darned or frayed or even muddy. As if every day is Easter Day. Do any of them resemble your father? John Protheroe the smith wants to know. Or Price Price or Mother Jenkins? But we hush him. We don’t want to think that the contents of our graveyard have got themselves up in their best clothes to trot about among us, formulating opinions. Martha shakes her head. They’re not like anyone I’ve seen before. In looks or behaviour. I believe they’re different from us altogether. Only child Martha’s limp identifies her from some distance. It is of the lurching, stiff-legged variety, like a boat hit side-on by a swell. She uses a stick, for walking only, never hitting. When a beast jibs or straggles, she chides, like a doting granny, in a voice you could mistake for praise. She combs the burs from her cow’s tail. Sometimes, milking, she seems to fall asleep with her head on Pluen’s flank. The only child of only children, since Enoch her father died, Martha has no family at all. She can breakfast at midnight if she pleases, not even trouble to prepare dinner. She has grown thinner these last years. If there were a tempest, such as our forebears talked of, strong enough to strip the thatch from our roofs and topple animals in their stalls, it might blow Martha away altogether, leaving only her shawl hooked in a blackthorn. Enoch wanted Martha to marry Abel Pritchard. There was a conversation and a handshake and for months Pritchard would call to smoke a pipe or play chess with Enoch. On Sundays, Pritchard would walk her to church, and a comical pairing they made, Martha bobbing in the lee of his ox plod. But in the end he found a girl younger and quicker, with a dowry worth the promise. The bitterness between Enoch and Pritchard lasted until the older man’s death. We do not know what Martha thought. The Reverends The Reverend Doctor Clough-Vaughan-Bowen comes all the way from the next county to see Martha. He lodges with the Reverend Rice-Mansel-Evans and early next morning the two men pick their way through a sparkling drizzle to the door of her cottage. Doctor Clough-Vaughan-Bowen is a learned man, of good family. He has written scholarly works, we understand, on subjects of interest to the clergy − adult baptism or the wearing of the chasuble. Rumour says he had a wife who died giving birth to their dying child. Rumour shrugs. When our neighbours and families suffer such losses we take gifts of hyssop or honey to their door, weep with them beside the new graves. But it is hard to believe that men such as Doctor Clough-Vaughan-Bowen have feelings as sharp or deep as our own. Mwynig and Brithen, we remember, bellow through the night that their calves are taken, but next day turn their inquiries instead to turnips. The Reverend Doctor has not come to reprimand Martha, nor to interrogate her. He talks, in his educated, university English, of which she comprehends a third at most, of many invisible things. Hopes and dreams and memories. The brains of horses. The souls of the dead. The imagination. The future. The swallows sleeping snugly at the bottom of the lake. He talks of the visible, and the traces it leaves. The fountain that sprang up where the saint pressed his thumb into the earth. The rock pierced by the giant’s spear. The stony pawprint left by Arthur’s hound hunting Twrch Trwyth across the mountain tops. You see what I’m saying? he says to Martha. Martha smiles and nods at moments where it seems appropriate. The drizzle gives way to stumps of rainbow parting a watery sky. The reverends pick their way back and Doctor Clough-Vaughan-Bowen takes his leave, apparently satisfied. French sauce Martha has pressed her nose to the windows of Mr Ingram’s mansion. The Invisible dine late, she tells us, but they light neither candle nor lamp. There is no fire even, but they seem warm enough in their cambrics and silks. The ladies’ throats and wrists are bare. They drink wine as red as rosehips from silver goblets. The china is blue and white, thin as a blade, and the table is laid with many dishes. They eat roast meats with French sauce, fillets and cheeks and sirloins, veal fricassey, veal ragoo, snipe, partridge, wheatears, lark livers simmered with cloves, blanched lettuce, white milk-bread, parsley and sweet herbs chopped fine, flummery and posset, clary fritters, heaped bowls of gooseberries and mulberries and quinces, sweetmeats coloured with spinach and beet and delicately fashioned into multitudinous shapes. But who waits at table? we want to know. Who delivers the food? Who cooks it? Martha has seen no Invisible footmen standing to attention, no butchers or vintners at the kitchen door. The Invisible, she insists, are all wealthy. There are no Invisible maids or carpenters or shopkeepers. The Invisible do no work. But how can they live without the poor to serve them? we ask. What about the puddings, says Eliza. Are they spiced? Do they wobble? Are they eaten hot or cold? There are baked puddings and boiled puddings and set puddings, says Martha. Wonderful domed and turreted puddings, like palaces. Thick with candied cherries and angelica. The custard is yellow as buttercups. They sit at table for hours, she tells us, but they talk more than they chew. They don’t gobble their food or help it to their mouths with their fingers, hunting down any fragments that fall and cramming them back in. Tell us about the meats, we say. Tell us about the cream. Tell us about the apricots and persimmons, the roast swans and haunches of venison. Tell us. Englyn We are enjoying a kind of fame. In other districts the gossip is of Martha. The Ingrams are mentioned in a number of sermons. The Dissenters make it yet another opportunity to talk of ale and tithes. Owen Owen composes an englyn on the subject of the Invisible that is perhaps not up to the standard of his early and most beautiful work but we admire its wisdom and one particularly melodious alliteration and some of us learn it to recite to our families as we sit beside our hearths. Markets are visibly better attended and at first we are grateful. But many of the newcomers spend only time, which they use to query and argue, cast aspersions, search behind walls and under trestles, inside calf cots and pig sties. If anyone asks what makes us so interesting, we have no answer. We cannot explain the Invisible’s curiosity. Some of us speculate it may be convenience, a matter of location. Some of us wonder if the attention is always kindly meant. Do they wrinkle their noses as they walk past us? Wave their lace handkerchiefs to clear the air? Do they avert their eyes from our misshapen bodies and pocked faces? Mr Ingram has a gold pocketwatch. He consults it more often than is strictly necessary for someone who has no appointments to keep. Ribbon Some of the young people – Naomi Price and Megan Prosser and their tittering friends, plus one or two lads who are sweet on them, and Mot, the Prices’ brindled cattle dog − have taken to aping the behaviour of the Invisible. They practise walking in no special direction and raising their eyebrows while others labour. They affect amazement at sickles and stooks and handlooms and potherbs and piglets. The girls have acquired a silk ribbon that they pass about between them so that one or another, usually Naomi, can wear it in her hair every day. They hold their skirts out of the mud, in the manner of Miss Ingram, and fan themselves with sprays of hawthorn. They have developed a sudden passion for knowledge, pestering Martha with questions. She indulges them until she tires or runs out of observations and then she shooes them away like so many finches. The next day they flock back, nudging and giggling, as at their first day of dame school. Martha tuts fondly and repeats yesterday’s lesson. We think it harmless enough until they neglect their work. Three times, John Protheroe has to fetch his boy back to the forge. There is a great deal of shouting and a coulter is spoiled. Megan judges herself too good to dip rushes, while Naomi protests that stitching or churning will roughen her hands. The Prices are accustomed to their daughter’s airs, but she has corrupted the once-faithful Mot, who now slinks away from his duties at every opportunity to bury his head in Naomi’s knees and sigh as she folds his pretty ears into a bow. The Ingrams should know better than to encourage such foolishness, we say to Martha. You should know better. And when some of us point out that young folk rarely need encouragement, no one listens. We must keep them close to home, we say. The dog can be tied up, but our children need another solution. We give them more chores, more responsibilities, make sure they are too tired for mischief. For a time, we think things back to normal. But the Protheroe boy wears a look of discontent as he works the bellows, and young Preece leans daydreaming on a shovel, next to the lime he should be spreading. As for Naomi, she has declared she will never marry. She would rather stay a spinster, she says, than grow red-cheeked and loose-waisted with a man whose favourite subject is the pigs he smells of. She can be seen rehearsing for her preferred future, strolling alone through marble halls or colonnades of pleached limes, her nose in the air and a frayed gold ribbon trailing behind. Unnavigable It is July and there has been no rain for five weeks. The summer pastures have scorched yellow, then black, as if they have combusted from within, and we bring the herds down early. The lake shrinks. Insects clump and die in its rotting margins. Springs that have never before failed run dry. When the cows complain of their multiple empty stomachs, we offer them leaves and twigs. Harvests are poor all about the district. The Invisible are enjoying the sun, Martha tells us. They walk out at full midday to admire unclimbable heights and horrible precipices. Their hats are large. They spread cloths on the ground before they sit. They picnic on assorted meats, potted and pastried and aspiced. They do a kind of dancing, the figures intricate and indecipherable. What is the music? we want to know. Who plays? Martha shakes her head. There are no musicians. It is in the air perhaps. They take it with them. Rain falls every day of September. The drops gather and hang in fleecy clouds until the commons resemble the floor of a shearing shed. The earth, muddled by these disorderly seasons, squanders her energies on green shoots that will not last the winter. It turns hot again. Haf bach Mihangel. The sunsets are bronze, the dawns like unripe strawberries. The new quarry drops its prices. There is an accident in which two men die and one loses the use of his arm. The Invisible are busy at their sports and pastimes. Not throwing or sparring or chasing a leather ball. Games with mysterious rules and objectives. Mr Ingram covers his eyes and the others circle around him, calling and pointing. Miss Ingram gestures like a bird, or an old woman, and they all laugh. They tilt and balance and yaw and hop and fall. There is no winner. Or they are all winners. It is hard to tell. November. The storms beat at our walls, howling accusations. When the winds drop, the bone chill starts. We count the jars, measure what’s left in barrels and sacks. Every creak is a stranger creeping through the darkness with intent. December. We muffle our noses, warm our hands in our armpits. At night we hug our husbands and children close to steal their heat. The salted meat is used, the pickles and dried fruit gone. We boil hide to make broth. January. February. Those with a cow are drinking milk and praying the hay will last. Those without are living on husks and air. The Prossers have sold their bedding and only a blanket donated by the Reverend keeps their youngest from perishing. The Ingrams must look across the lake, see our cottages dimly lit, some without smoke even. Do they imagine us huddled inside, stupid with cold, our fingers white? In the second half of March, there is a run of dewy bright mornings. The milfyw flowers, and we put the cattle out to graze. They skip and buck like the ogre’s darling children, dip their heads to the celandines to admire their bristled chins. A soft breeze strokes our hair and we hold our faces to the sun. The frogs croak all night. The sparrows get busy in our roofs and we in our beds. But one afternoon the sky is spotted with peewits and golden plovers, fieldfares and redwings. They wheel above us, calling their alarm, then the snow they are fleeing arrives. It is the heaviest fall in ten years, heaping against walls, holding our doors closed. By morning, earth and air are so white that half a mile from us a new shore seems to have formed, before a strange, unnavigable sea. It is days before we can drive our animals to pasture, and when we do, bird corpses litter the ground, too many even for the foxes, and the grass is stewed. When Martha limps into view we forget to ask how she is managing and instead inquire after the Invisible. How do they like the winter? Do they startle when the wind jeers from their chimneys? Do their slates seal out the thaw? They play cards. They enjoy jugged hare and buttered peas, sugar cakes enrobed in sugar. Miss Ingram’s frock is lilac, lit from within like a spring sky. We look at each other. We frown. Some propose going to the Ingrams’ door to beg for work or failing that last night’s bones or a measure of barley. We should get up a committee, perhaps, to remind the Ingrams of their duty to their neighbours. Some even mutter of going in force. We will don dresses and bonnets for disguise, paint our faces white, light torches. But some object. We don’t need violence. Martha will help us. Let us be there when they visit, we say, as we have said before. Let us talk to them. Tell me your demands, she says. I will represent you. But it is not enough. We want to make our own case. We want to hear how they respond. Many of us are wiser than Martha. Many of us know more English. We will not be denied. The Ingrams abhor questions, she says, or importuning. We will be quiet. We will only speak when spoken to. They cannot bear any light but that of the sun and the moon. We are accustomed to darkness, we say. Creaks and ventings In the twilight borrowed from a clear night sky, we recognize our neighbours’ heads and shoulders, their creaks and ventings, familiar from vigils and services. That is Widow Johns, that is Eliza, that is young Jenkin Jenkins, taking advantage of the situation to slide up close to Mary Probert. That is mice hurrying in the thatch. That is Pluen at the other end of the room, grumbling about a greasy trough or spiders in her hay. We yawn and sigh and stretch and fidget. We listen. And finally we hear something. We think we hear something. A padding that is the approach of feet softer than a cat’s, feet that make no mark on the ground. A noise as of leaves or water, gradually increasing. Then a figure rises before us. A figure that is quite obviously, even in this dusk, Jacob, with a shawl draped over his head. He starts speaking, or piping rather, in a high-pitched voice, words that are not words in any language we know. We aren’t sure what to do. Beneath his trill, an undercurrent of confusion and dismay begins. Come along now, that’s enough of that, says Old Mr Jenkins. Jacob keeps on babbling and chirping. He totters in a circle, flaps a lunatic hand. Almost falls over Martha stepping forward to protest, almost saves himself, staggers again, knocks her to the floor. Then we are all up, talking at once, cheering and booing and baying, like a crowd at a hanging. Some help Martha, others pull the cover from Jacob’s head. He is laughing. In a minute a rushlight is burning. Our faces glow red and orange, outraged, amused, disgusted, disappointed. So much for your Invisible, says Jacob, cackling. And some of us cackle with him. So much for lies and nonsense. So much for anyone who thinks themselves better than us. Martha has her face in her hands and Eliza is comforting her, turning every now and then to berate Jacob. Look what you’ve done, says Eliza. And some of us join in. Look what you’ve done. They will never come now. Pullet We scold Jacob until he agrees to apologise. He presents himself at Martha’s cottage with a speckled pullet under his arm. She shuts the door in their faces. Although, in the matter of Jacob’s behaviour, our sympathies lie with Martha, the incident is not unwelcome to everyone. His method was crude, we admit, but he has expressed our own misgivings. Others are confident that Jacob’s stunt has only delayed our meeting with the Invisible. Next time, we say, we will be more particular with our invitations. Martha herself seems to have aged years overnight, as elderly people sometimes do, in a sudden haste to know their end. She will not discuss the abortive visit, nor will she deliver fresh news. Tell us what the Ingrams are up to, we say. Have there been parties or excursions? A masked ball perhaps? But she will say nothing. For a time, we make do with other topics. White peas reach double the price of wheat. Sucking pigs are 15s a head. John Johns and Ruth Prosser break their engagement and a month later mend it. Rachel Protheroe gives birth to twins. The hay is affected by mildew. In the next parish, we hear, a cow is struck by lightning and her calf bleaches white, not a shred of colour left in it. That, we think, is something Miss Ingram might wish to see. But when we say this to Martha, she turns her back. Some point to Martha’s silence as evidence of deceit. Others defend her. It is shameful, we say, to treat an old woman with so little respect. There must be respect on both sides, we respond. We’d sooner listen to Martha than to mischief-makers, we say. Fools are the best audience for foolery, we reply. Rancour and rebuke creep among us like fleas. Friends fall out. Families almost come to blows. Some of us declare ourselves fed up with the whole business and ready to agree with anyone who will leave us in peace. We start gathering fuel for next winter. We will stack it high this year, make a wall we cannot see over. As harvest arrives, we watch our neighbours at their crops and do not offer to help. When it is our turn, they reciprocate. Martha has become increasingly solitary. She is gaining a reputation for rudeness. She tells the Reverend’s wife to keep her baked goods to herself. She shouts at two of the smallest Prossers until they run home crying. She rarely comes to market. When we do see her, we observe that her limp is more pronounced. She stops to rest often. Eliza brings us reports. Martha has a cough that will not mend. She is several times confined to her bed. We bring her the treats invalids are thought to enjoy, borage tea and calves’ feet. She has no appetite. We keep her fire burning, milk Pluen, feed the chickens. When she dies (But that won’t be now, will it? she asks, waking from troubled sleep), we will only need tell the bees. Shadow There is a new prime minister in London. Laws are repealed, laws are passed. Perhaps moths will benefit from the candle tax and robbers from improvements in the highways. Nobody asks our opinion. Like grass, we are meant to thrive unattended, underfoot. We watch the road and the bridge. We look especially hard at visitors on marketdays. In early winter, when a light snow falls, we walk around the lake. We see prints of fox, polecat, badger. Nothing else. As we turn for home, the powder squeaks, curling our spines. If we were rich as the Ingrams, we say, we would put up a stone drinking fountain and have our name carved on it for all to read. We would build clocktowers and almshouses and schools. They would all bear our name. Winter closes around us again. We have no heart for the seasonal festivities. We leave the wren in the hedge, the mistletoe in the trees, the mare’s skull in the barn. We burn through our ramparts of fuel. To no one’s astonishment, the Prossers lose their cow. Fecklessness, we whisper. We should take them some of our own milk, a little oatmeal too. Perhaps tomorrow, we say, moving our feet closer to the fire. When spring comes we are still alive. The day comes up a glistening mist briefly suffused with rose. We dig and trench, plant peas and early cabbages, blister our hands and break our backs. We inspect the walls and ditches we repaired this time last year, this time the year before. Some of us patch a gap here or there, some of us shrug and stare into the distance. The sun falls through the haze like a scarlet millstone. The Protheroe boy and Naomi Price run off in the night, gone to Liverpool, we learn, to seek their fortune in the Americas. John Preece gets an apprenticeship in Bristol. He will be his own master one day, he boasts, master of others. He will be an alderman, a mayor, with glass windows in his house and a gold chain around his neck. We give the pigs extra barley, thinking this year we will feed them until they are too fat to walk. They will have to sit down, like little gentlemen, to take their last meal. We will kill them early, have a feast whose memory will warm us through the cold months. Chops and ribs and belly and brisket, liver and lights and blood pudding. We will eat from one breakfast to the next, saving nothing. If we need a rest, we will lay our heads right there on the table. Sometimes, as we go about our day, a shadow falls. A blackbird clatters in unprovoked alarm. Sometimes we think we see figures on the stone bridge. They have no occupation other than leaning and an ease, leaning, that none of our visible neighbours could achieve. They are looking in our direction. We almost think they are looking at us. We lower our eyes and walk the other way. But at night we cannot sleep for thinking of them, across the lake, drifting on pallets of down and feather. And we wonder if they ever dream of us, or only of morning, when they will come stepping through the rushes, pocketwatches in their pale hands, passing through us like a breeze through leaves, a wave through water.

41	Soundbite of the day Priti Patel, the home secretary, on whom irony is not lost as she declared: “Here in Manchester, the Conservative party takes its rightful place as the party of law and order in Britain once again.” Just one week ago, the government was found to have unlawfully prorogued parliament and it continues to try to find ways to get around the Benn Act to stop a no-deal Brexit. Disagreement of the day Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP was sent home in shame by the Conservatives after a dispute with a member of staff working at the conference when he wanted to take a guest into the international lounge who did not have the correct pass. Security were called, then the police and paramedics, resulting in the centre being put on partial lockdown – all before the watchful eyes of hundreds of journalists working in the room next door. The party issued a statement saying his behaviour had been unacceptable. Joke of the day Matt Hancock, the health secretary: “Everybody is in favour of cheap drugs. Prescription! Obviously I mean prescription drugs.” Star of the day Boris Johnson’s aide Shelley Williams-Walker, who swiped a disposable coffee cup out of the prime minister’s hand in a valiant effort to prove his green credentials for the cameras. She was picked up on mic saying sternly: “No disposable coffee cups”, to which a crestfallen Johnson uttered “oh, oh, oh” as his drink was swiped from under his nose. Later in the day, the prime minister tweeted: “Got my coffee in the end” alongside a picture of him holding a Get Brexit Done mug. Wednesday’s highlights All eyes will be on Johnson’s conference speech at 11.40am. No fringe events are scheduled but the uber-keen can watch a session on strengthening the union with the Northern Ireland, Welsh and Scottish secretaries at 10am. The Guardian Politics Weekly podcast will be released on Wednesday afternoon to help makes sense of it all.
42	Shortly after revelations first surfaced about Alberto Salazar being investigated by the US Anti-Doping Agency in 2015, I asked a UK Athletics contact whether they feared reputational damage if he was ever convicted. “Of course,” came the reply. “But we’ve gone all in on Alberto and Nike.” Long past the witching hour in Doha on Monday night, that decision came back to haunt them. And with the legendary American coach now banned for four years for “orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct”, UKA now looks desperately short of chips. After all, it was not a good look that your performance director Neil Black – who once hailed Salazar as a “genius” and “one of the best people to work with that I have ever come across” – continued to give the American the benefit of the doubt for several years despite damaging accusations made by Panorama programme Catch Me If You Can? And it did not exactly inspire confidence when UKA’s own performance oversight management, set up to investigate the interaction of the Nike Oregon Project with its star athlete Mo Farah, found “no reason for concern” – despite speaking to several whistleblowers. You wonder what the investigators, led by former sprinter Jason Gardener and marathon runner Sarah Rowell, were asking. When I spoke to Allan Kupczak, a former massage therapist at the Nike Oregon Project in 2015, he told me Salazar always carried testosterone with him. As he put it: “Alberto would say: ‘Don’t let anyone touch my bag – I have my testosterone cream in there. I don’t want anyone to get contaminated accidentally.’ My thought was why risk something that could possibly contaminate the athlete?” That raised a red flag for me. Others I spoke to had similar stories. No wonder Steve Magness, the BBC’s main whistleblower, was dismissive about UKA’s enquiry and said that he had only a 30-45 minute interview with their panel. So why did UKA not establish more distance from Salazar in 2015? According to one senior insider, the organisation should have done more, but some figures were either too close to Salazar, or did not appreciate the scale of the revelations. “Where were UK Sport in all this?” the source added. “They weren’t putting any pressure on UKA to get rid of Salazar at any time up to Rio.” However, the biggest factor was Farah himself. The simple fact is he did not want to leave the man who had transformed him from a decent distance runner, who finished seventh in the 5,000m at the 2009 world championships, into an unstoppable title-winning machine between 2011 and 2017. That clearly left UK Athletics in a bind. After the BBC Panorama programme aired in June 2015, Farah promised UKA he was going to ditch Salazar. But at some point on a flight from Portland to the UK, he had dramatically changed his mind. After that, few in UKA wanted to go against its double Olympic champion – because they needed his medals – or be too critical of Nike given its massive kit sponsorship of the organisation. Only UKA’s chairman, Ed Warner, who suggested Farah should suspend his relationship with Salazar, sounded a note of caution. Otherwise everyone stuck to the line: the American was innocent until proven guilty. And of course he was. However, there was surely a middle way that would have meant establishing distance from Salazar without condemning him. After all, much of what is in the American Arbitration Association report, which found that Salazar had been “orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct” while head coach of the Nike Oregon Project, was known in 2015 – including that Salazar infused his athletes with more than the permitted levels of L-carnitine, and got another, Amy Begley, to unwittingly transport an envelope with testosterone cream on it, which he later used in a bizarre experiment on his sons. Incidentally, the report contains several fresh testimonies that certainly raise some eyebrows. The American former athlete Danny Mackey says that while he was working at the Nike lab he was told by one of the doctors, Loren Myhre, to take thyroid and testosterone therapy. Mackey testifies that Dr Myhre told him: “This is what Salazar’s athletes do, and they haven’t gotten caught. You’ll be OK.” Salazar has always denied any wrongdoing with his athletes. The report also contains Salazar’s emails to Nike’s chief executive, Mark Parker, in which the coach discusses experimenting with a banned testosterone product called Androgel, which can boost performance, on his own sons. In one of his emails, Salazar indicates that using a small amount does not reach the level that would “trigger great concern” about failing a test. To which Parker responds: “It will be interesting to determine the minimal amount required to create a positive test.” The panel accepted Salazar’s explanation that he was experimenting with testosterone on his sons because he was paranoid that someone might try to spike one of his athletes. However, it added: “While the panel accepts [the] Respondent’s contention that the experiment was designed to protect athletes of the NOP, it could have also been conducted as part of a nefarious attempt to ‘beat’ the testing system and thus is susceptible to creating an appearance of cheating that one could argue would bring the experiment much closer to being ‘in connection with’ an athlete, competition or training.” There is no evidence that Farah cheated. But sometimes you judge people by the company they keep. And his record of being coached by Salazar, plus his friendship with Jama Aden, who is being investigated by Spanish Anti‑Doping, are two strikes against him. Farah denies continuing any relationship with Aden since 2015 when the coach acted as an “unofficial facilitator” to UKA. It is worth remembering, too, that at a press conference in 2015 Farah promised he would speak to whistleblowers. “Definitely, for my sake,” he said. “I want to know the answers. Because at the end of the day it’s my reputation. Because the headline is not Alberto. It’s Mo’s coach. And it’s not fair on kids, my family, people who come out and watch me. At the Olympics 75,000 people were cheering for me, and I think them 75,000 people should know what’s going on. I should at least be honest with them.” The passion in his words suggested he was serious. Sadly for him, and UKA, he does not appear to have acted on them.

145	Growth brings change. It is inevitable. Women’s football is growing at an impressive rate. Attendances are starting to climb. The showpiece fixtures – 24,790 at the London Stadium on Sunday, 24,564 at Stamford Bridge and 31,213 at the Etihad on the opening weekend – are stealing the headlines and attendance figures are already closing on the number of fans across all 110 WSL games last season (92,000). But the more standard home venues of women’s teams are also seeing more fans through the turnstiles too. Providing a welcoming environment for all is important. It would be easy and understandable for long-time fans of the women’s game, who have stuck with it through the cold and empty lows, to resent slightly the arrival of new kids on the block or any changes to their usual routine or to the “way things are done”. And there is an element of that in the attitudes towards Manchester United fans on the club’s re-entry to women’s football last season. These are not fans of women’s football per se, they are fans of Manchester United and, as such, bring the “everybody hates us but we don’t care” swagger of the club’s supporters as a whole into Leigh Sports Village to cheer on Casey Stoney’s side each week. What is not OK is when chants are offensive. The “always the victim, it’s never your fault” chants directed at Liverpool by United supporters at Leigh on Saturday have rightly been flagged to the FA by the Merseyside club. For victims, families and fans that had to embark on a gruelling 30-year fight against multiple sections of the establishment to be cleared of any blame for the deaths of 96 supporters at Hillsborough it is hugely offensive and triggering. “Never your fault” has over the years made a mockery of their fight for the truth. There is no place for this type of chanting in football. To have this chant rear its head at a women’s football match is unprecedented and hugely disappointing. Manchester United and the FA have said they are both investigating and it is right that this incident is dealt with firmly. In May fans of Manchester City men’s team defended a version of Allez, Allez, Allez using the line “victims of it all” and “battered on the streets” being sung by players and staff members on a plane saying they were referring to the incident between Mo Salah and Sergio Ramos in the 2018 Champions League final. Manchester United men’s team fans have previously claimed to be using the chant in reference to the Luis Suárez racism row. But if something is considered offensive, just saying it is not, or challenging the affronted’s interpretation, does not make it inoffensive. But one has to be careful about blaming the influx of new fans into the women’s game for this incident. Football reflects attitudes in wider society. Hate speech and bullying have seeped into the mainstream, where to shock is the norm, where the Katie Hopkinses and Tommy Robinsons of the world can make livings from being controversial and offensive. In a week where Boris Johnson, Dominic Cummings and their ilk are the focus of a debate around appropriate language it should be no surprise that there are similar conversations about respect in football. There is a lot to like in the fiery atmosphere more fans bring. For one, players like playing in intense environments; they thrive off their passion on the pitch being mimicked in the stands. After Toni Duggan scored in front of a sold-out 60,739 fans at the Wanda Metropolitano against the Atlético Madrid team she has now joined, she gushed about the quality of the crowd being more important than the quantity. “There’s a picture of me celebrating and behind me there’s actually a man putting one finger up,” she recalled. “I’m not promoting that or saying it’s a good thing but it kind of showed what it meant. You could feel the passion in the stadium that day. It was a real atmosphere.” When United played champions Arsenal for the first time in the Women’s Super League a week ago, tensions were high. That it was an 89th-minute goal that would give the Gunners all three points ensured the ground became more of a cauldron as the clock ticked. The booing of Jordan Nobbs, whose return from a World Cup-ending cruciate ligament injury has been well documented, when she was scythed down in her own half was a little distasteful. The “same old Arsenal, always cheating” was just a bit irrelevant to followers of the women’s team. The “Man City reject” chants at Mel Lawley were slightly ironic given the player she had slid into, Ella Toone, was also a former Manchester City player. The boos as players’ names were read out and the booing of substitutes, all added to a feeling that they are going against a sort of unwritten rule that in women’s football you should cheer not jeer, that the family friendly atmosphere must be preserved. But why? And what exactly is a family friendly atmosphere? Part of the joy of standing in the stands watching men’s football, particularly as a child, is watching and experiencing collective euphoria/devastation/frustration. It is of seeing your parent or sibling swear with raw instinctive emotion, unusually uncensored, and feeling as if, for once, you are being treated as an adult and trusted to use your judgment rather than being tiptoed around. There is a difference between a family friendly environment and an infantilised and sterile one that casts aside some of the best bits of fandom in search of a purified utopia. The balance must be found. More people in the women’s game means a bigger demographic and wider views will be represented at grounds. That includes a sometimes vocal minority. That does not mean inappropriate behaviour should be accepted. Football can and should lead the way on challenging lazy stereotypes, racism, sexism and offensive behaviour and use education, bans and its influence to change things. But until these ugly views from society are eradicated they will rear their heads in sport, which must make sure it keeps cracking down on them.

43	Gary Kirsten will meet with the England and Wales Cricket Board on Wednesday to outline his vision for the men’s national team and its vacant head coach position. The former South Africa opener, 51, has emerged as the leading candidate for the role given a coaching CV that includes taking both his home country and India to No 1 in the Test rankings, as well as overseeing the latter’s World Cup win in 2011. Kirsten has been reluctant to coach at international level since leaving the South Africa post in 2013 due to travel demands and time away from home. He has predominantly operated on the Twenty20 circuit since but has gone through England’s future tours programme and decided he can make it work. Ashley Giles, the director of England cricket, is overseeing the process to find a replacement for Trevor Bayliss and previously stated the new head coach will be able to miss some series amid a hectic schedule, allowing the assistants to take charge for short spells and further their own experience. Giles had previously stated his preference for an Englishman, with Chris Silverwood, the current fast bowling coach, considered another frontrunner due to his previous title-winning experience at Essex. Surrey’s Alec Stewart has also been linked, so too England’s batting coach, Graham Thorpe. Graham Ford, the South African coach of Ireland, is another known to have been sounded out. With Eoin Morgan committed to leading the limited-overs sides for another 12 months at least – the T20 World Cup next year in Australia is the new goal – the focus for Giles is now finding the ideal candidate to support Joe Root in Test cricket and build a side that can regain the Ashes in 2021/22. Silverwood and Thorpe are expected to take charge for the upcoming tour of New Zealand regardless, having been pencilled in on an interim basis and squads for the five Twenty20 internationals and two Test matches already selected. Should Kirsten land the job, he would not be free until December’s trip to South Africa due to a previously-agreed commitment with Durban Heat in the country’s Mzansi Super League. However, England could yet buy him out of that contract to speed up his arrival, while they would also need to find a replacement head coach for the Cardiff-based team in the Hundred – a role Kirsten signed up to back in August.
44	Marks &amp; Spencer is to offer a “buy now, pay later” option to online shoppers as part of a plan to modernise its struggling clothing business which had a “lost 18 months”, the company has admitted. While maintaining its crown as the UK’s largest clothing retailer, sales at the high street giant have been falling for seven years. On Tuesday, its chief executive, Steve Rowe, told an investor meeting that letting customers pay for website orders in instalments was one of the “tactical actions” it planned to take to halt the slide. Rival chain Next has a substantial store card-style credit arm, and young shoppers are embracing digital payment systems such as Klarna in growing numbers. M&amp;S is yet to sign a contract with a payment service. M&amp;S is facing an existential crisis as sales migrate online and the recent collapse in its share price has cost the retailer its place in the prestigious FTSE 100. Rowe confessed to analysts that the revamp of its clothing business was 18 months behind schedule and he was still trying to fix “the basics: its buyers still bought too many clothes that didn’t sell, while popular lines sold out. Jill McDonald, its clothing boss, was ousted in July after buying mistakes ahead of a jeans promotion left it with empty rails for a month. While much of the focus falls on M&amp;S’s womenswear business, the company admitted its menswear division needed attention after its market share had slipped by 1.5 percentage points over the last five years. Shoppers had told it the clothes were “too old” and the fightback involved it stocking more slim and skinny-fit trousers. With the Brexit deadline looming the company told the investor meeting that crashing out without a deal would have a substantial impact on its food-hall arm, where sales have stabilised under Stuart Machin. The turnaround is being steered by Archie Norman, its no-nonsense chairman of two years, and there are signs that he is growing impatient with performance. Last week the company said Humphrey Singer, its newish finance director, was, like McDonald, also headed for the exit. Berenberg analyst Michelle Wilson said that until the overdue overhaul was complete the retailer was “fighting with one hand tied behind its back” against more agile peers. “We were left feeling that there is still a lot to do,” she said. The shares closed up nearly 2% at 187.75p.
45	Ukraine has opened an investigation into Yuriy Lutsenko, a former prosecutor who fed information about the Biden family to Rudy Giuliani, shortly after he left the country, apparently for an English language course. It was not immediately clear if the investigation launched on Tuesday is a form of political retribution for Lutsenko’s role in an international scandal that has led Democrats to open an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. Lutsenko is one of several prosecutors who shared information with Giuliani that claimed to show that Joe Biden scuttled an investigation into his son’s business dealings with a Ukrainian company, Burisma. The investigation caught Trump’s attention and in a July phone call, he repeatedly told Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate the Biden family while withholding military aid. Last week, a whistleblower complaint about the call with the Ukrainian president prompted Democrats to launch the impeachment inquiry. Lutsenko has since said that the investigation did not show that the Biden family had broken any laws in Ukraine. Zelenskiy on Tuesday said that he did not feel pressured by Trump and had never met or spoken with Giuliani, despite the former New York mayor’s repeated attempts to contact him or travel to Kyiv. The investigation into Lutsenko was opened at the request of a lawmaker in the president’s party, who said he suspected the former prosecutor of ties to underground gambling in the capital, Kyiv. A spokesperson for the State Bureau of Investigations confirmed the investigation to local media, saying that it was an inquiry into “abuse of office for facilitating illegal gambling”. Lutsenko told reporters earlier this week that he was flying to the United Kingdom to attend a six-week language course to prepare for the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) exam. He did not appear to be joking. His spokeswoman has also said that he had has left to study English.
46	If the big reorganisation of the John Lewis Partnership falls flat, who would incoming chair, Sharon White, fire? Well, it won’t be the chief executive since the partnership doesn’t employ anyone with that title. But nor, from next year, will there be managing directors – one for the department stores and one for Waitrose. Instead, White will chair an executive team comprising seven directors with responsibilities across both halves of the business. It’s unconventional, not least because White, current boss of communications regulator Ofcom, has never worked in retailing. And she’ll arrive in the new year to find that Rob Collins, the old-hand Waitrose boss, has gone, having decided there isn’t a job in the new structure that suits him. The risks, then, are obvious. Instead of “more innovation, faster decision-making and bolder steps”, as current chair Sir Charlie Mayfield describes the new approach, the outcome could be: apart from White, who’s actually in charge around here? But one can understand the thinking. If an annual £100m can be saved “over time” by being leaner, it would be odd to stand still. Retailing’s glory days aren’t coming back soon and rivals have also been chopping jobs from head office, even if the partnership’s cull of one in three out of 225 senior roles looks adventurous. There may also be some easy wins from integration. At the moment, John Lewis customers, by shoving so many “click and collect” orders towards their local Waitroses, appear more joined-up than management. So one can applaud the ambition. Making it work, though, is the hard part: it’s a partnership, but that doesn’t mean there can’t be turf battles. Questions remain for Credit Suisse What a curious form of words. Credit Suisse responded to the spying scandal that has gripped the banking world by saying this: the investigation “did not identify any indication that the CEO had approved the observation of Iqbal Khan”. In other words, Tidjane Thiam, former chief at the Prudential in the UK, can stay in post. Instead, his deputy, chief operating officer Pierre-Olivier Bouée, has been fired, having confessed that he alone ordered a surveillance job to be performed on Khan, who was skipping off to join arch-rival UBS. But how hard did the board, or its law firm Homburger, look for indications that might implicate Thiam? Well, it was a one-week investigation, which is brisk. And Credit Suisse confirmed that investigators from Homburger did not have access to deleted messages sent over an encrypted system. Nor could they see files held by police, who are still looking into potential criminal offences. Those features do not, of course, in themselves undermine the idea that Thiam was gloriously ignorant of what Bouée was doing. But we do know that Bouée was a loyal lieutenant, having risen with Thiam, all the way from Aviva and Prudential in the UK to Credit Suisse in Zurich. If Thiam was not aware that Bouée had ordered a high-risk and highly unusual surveillance job on a defecting colleague – one that has caused “severe reputational damage to the bank”, says the board – he surely should have known. LSE takeover? Nothing to see here Are you enjoying the cut and thrust of London’s biggest takeover battle in ages? You know the sort of thing – rival managements trading insults, politicians riding hobby-horses, corporate history on the line. You’ve missed it? Well, quite. The Hong Kong stock exchange’s £32bn hostile attempt to buy the London Stock Exchange has become a snooze-fest. The approach was made public three weeks ago, meaning the Hong Kong crew have only one more week under the rules to “put up or shut up”. So far, they’ve only been doing the latter. When Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) received a flat rejection last month, it said it was undeterred and would talk to the LSE’s shareholders instead. That process normally involves creating some noise in public and generally being a nuisance. In this case, onlookers were expecting a blistering and sustained attack on the LSE’s plan to pay $27bn (£22bn) for data and terminals group Refinitiv. Instead, there’s been near silence. Maybe HKEX will surprise us next Wednesday by making its terms hostile and formal. That would be brave since it remains hard to see how a takeover could succeed without backing from an LSE board that has said it sees “fundamental flaws” in the proposal. Alternatively, the would-be bidder could withdraw and retreat, which currently looks more likely. If so, what was the point of pitching up?
47	British democracy is at one of its “low points” and the government’s justice policy is letting “prisons proliferate”, the bishop of London has said at the formal opening of the legal year. Delivering the sermon in Westminster Abbey on Tuesday, the Rt Rev Dame Sarah Mullally referred to the “chaos and confusion” of the Brexit crisis and praised Magna Carta for holding the king – and by implication the executive – to account. The annual ceremony for the start of the legal year was held a week after the supreme court handed down its unanimous 11-strong judgment that Boris Johnson’s decision to suspend parliament for five weeks at the height of the Brexit crisis was unlawful. Hundreds of the UK’s most senior judges in their traditional wigs and scarlet and ermine, purple-embroidered or blue-lapelled robes thronged the abbey for the hour-long service. The lord chancellor and justice secretary, Robert Buckland, gave the first reading on Solomon’s judgment. The biblical king’s threat to cut a disputed baby in two was probably not intended to come across as a modern parable for the Conservative party. But Mullally’s sermon required less interpretation. Recalling the prophet Amos, who declared, “Let justice roll down like a mighty stream”, she said: “I don’t think he really meant let police forces expand, let prisons proliferate, let criminals get their just desserts. “Justice in the Bible is less to do with conviction of the guilty and more to do with the care of the innocent,” she said. Scripture was more concerned with “widows, orphans and aliens – the vulnerable”. She continued: “The rule of law in this country has arisen out of this biblical tradition. The concern of the law with justice … law holds the powerful to account and protects the vulnerable. “Interestingly, the 61st clause of Magna Carta, known as the security clause, declared that a council of 25 barons be created with power to overrule the will of the king by force if necessary … “Sometimes, as human leaders, we get it wrong. The wisdom of Solomon in our reading gives way later to Solomon’s folly where he has 700 wives, 300 concubines and sacrifices to false gods. “Likewise, for all the high points of British democracy, there are low points, too. Arguably our present situation is one of them. Filled with chaos and confusion, it is one in which wisdom is required.” Her comments came as the charity Inquest, which supports relatives at coroners’ courts, released figures exposing the low level of legal support for those whose family members died while in the care of state bodies. The figures, obtained through Freedom of Information (FoI) requests by BBC Radio 4’s File on 4 programme, show that last year £41,265 was granted by the Legal Aid Agency (LAA) towards the legal fees of families’ representation for those who had died in police custody. By contrast, the 32 police forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland that replied showed their legal bills for the inquests came to nearly £410,000 – 10 times the amount granted for families’ legal costs. Julie’s Mental Health Foundation submitted similar FoI requests to 53 mental health trusts in England asking how much they spent on lawyers at inquests in the financial year 2017-18. Among the 26 trusts that responded, expenditure on legal representation at inquests was around £4m. In the same year the LAA paid a total of £118,000 towards fees for legal representation at inquests for families following the death of a relative in contact with mental health services. Deborah Coles, the director of Inquest, said: “Inquests following state-related deaths are intended to seek the truth and expose unsafe practices. Yet families face state lawyers funded at public expense who work together to limit the remit and put defence of their interests above the search for the truth. “This inequality of arms is the single greatest obstacle to bereaved families … the shocking statistics highlighting the disparities between funding for bereaved families and public authorities show why urgent reform is needed.”
48	The BBC is facing growing calls to reform its complaints system and ensure the process treats all staff the same after the corporation’s disastrous handling of viewer feedback about the BBC Breakfast host Naga Munchetty. The decision to censure Munchetty turned a single partially upheld viewer complaint about her alleged bias against Donald Trump into a crisis for the broadcaster, which has revived broader complaints within the organisation about the treatment of people of colour in its news operation. It has also cast doubt on the BBC’s ability to enforce its strict guidelines on journalistic impartiality in the future, after the director general, Tony Hall, overturned the ruling against the presenter on Monday night after days of anger from outside and inside the organisation. His decision came after the Guardian obtained leaked correspondence showing the original viewer complaint was also about Munchetty’s co-host Dan Walker, who was not put under scrutiny. The editorial standards chief, David Jordan, had said Walker was not investigated because he was not mentioned in the complaint, with the BBC later clarifying that he meant Walker was not mentioned in the revised viewer grievance that went to the top-level executive complaints unit. Hall has repeatedly defended the BBC’s commitment to impartial news coverage in the face of politically motivated complaints about its output from across the spectrum. The corporation’s guidelines state that audiences should not be able to tell the personal opinions of journalists or news and current affairs presenters on matters of public policy, political, or industrial controversy. Roger Mosey, a former head of BBC TV news, suggested the corporation often found itself struggling with its own bureaucracy when it came to contentious decisions. “There’s a respect for process which means they end up for the first four or five days defending the process and it’s only late in the day that you decide you can’t really defend the conclusion of the process,” he said. “Staff are now really confused about what can and can’t be said on air, and what’s lived experience and what’s not.” He said the BBC could now face demands from presenters who were religious conservatives to reflect on issues such as the teaching of same-sex relationships in schools or Jewish reporters could wish to offer personal responses to allegations of antisemitism in the Labour party. The corporation has previously attempted to quash public protests this year from some of its LGBT journalists, arguing that some issues surrounding gay rights should not be up for debate. Hundreds of journalists across the BBC’s domestic news service and the World Service – including some senior on-air correspondents – have taken the highly unusual step of sending an internal letter to Hall demanding reform. They want a codified approach on how the corporation can report on issues of race in an increasingly polarised world, as it faces bad faith complaints from political campaigners about its output. “It asked the director general to strengthen the BBC’s guidelines on reporting racism,” said one person who has seen the correspondence. “It also called for a review of diversity and equality policy across newsrooms - which many staff feel has failed to ensure BAME staff progress through newsrooms to enter senior editorial positions.” Even some BBC journalists who feel angry that Munchetty was singled out by the corporation believe she did technically breach the code as it is currently framed. They are now considering how to press management to update the guidelines to reflect modern attitudes and reduce the ability of a small number of complaints to influence output. The former BBC director general Mark Thompson, now the chief executive of the New York Times, told an audience in London that the broadcaster’s commitment to impartiality had been weaponised: “The BBC’s virtues, one of its virtues has been turned against it. That’s a characteristic of a long-running story.” Bizarrely, according to multiple individuals at the corporation, at least one BBC executive who put their name to a statement issued on Friday defending the original ruling has now apologised to colleagues for doing so. The individual allegedly said they were unaware the original viewer complaint also mentioned Walker until they read it in the Guardian. Hall’s decision to overturn the ruling also raises questions about the independence and authority of the BBC’s in-house executive complaints unit, given the director general has now shown he is willing to overturn its decisions in the face of sustained public pressure. Under the current rules, the media regulator, Ofcom, which handles complaints for all commercial broadcasters, can only consider complaints if the BBC is unhappy with the original decision. Jeremy Corbyn, who is engaged in a lengthy dispute with the BBC over a Panorama programme regarding allegations of antisemitism in the Labour party, said the BBC must apologise and overhaul its complaints procedure. “When people of colour call out racism they should be listened to and supported,” he said. “Action should be taken against racists, not those that challenge them.” Boris Johnson declined to comment on the issue. The prime minister told LBC he had never heard of Munchetty and did not know anything about the dispute. Other journalists said that while the BBC was working hard to diversify its workplace through recruitment, the upper levels of management were still dominated by older, white men who shape editorial guidelines. “Naga’s case is just symbolic of a lot of issues that haven’t been addressed effectively for years,” said one BBC journalist from a minority ethnic background. “It’s sad because we are so loyal to it and believe in public service.”
49	If you enjoy a spot of food, like to breathe air and partake in the occasional drink of water (tap or bottled), then you’re almost certainly an unwitting consumer of microplastics. People who use triangular nylon tea bags are the latest group to be shocked at their exposure to plastics. According to one study, they could be getting about 11bn or so particles of plastic with their Earl Grey or breakfast tea. Microplastics have turned up pretty much everywhere that scientists have looked for them – from the bottom of the deepest parts of our oceans to the stomachs of whales, seabirds and in our own poo. But should we be worried about our plastic diet – either for the sake of our own health or for the health of the environment? What is microplastic? There’s no agreed definition, but researchers have generally referred to pieces of plastic smaller than about 5mm as microplastic. However, the University of New South Wales’s Mark Browne, who has been researching plastics since 2004, says it’s better to think about plastics relative to the units they’re measured in. So microplastics are between one micrometre and 1,000 micrometres wide (there are 1,000 micrometres in one millimetre). There’s also an emerging field of research looking at nanoplastics – pieces too small to see with the naked eye – which are measured in nanometres (there are 1,000 nanometres in one micrometre). What’s important to remember is that the larger pieces of plastic that can entangle wildlife end up in the stomachs of animals and litter our coastlines will in many cases become the microplastics of tomorrow. What is it doing to our health? “There’s an absence of science here,” says Browne. “We know that across particle sizes, plastics can cause issues. The critical issue now is what are the concentrations that people and wildlife are being exposed to. We don’t need more studies on which products emit plastics. We need studies that expose organisms or models to these doses to see if they cause problems.” Environmental scientist Kevin Thomas, director of the Queensland Alliance for Environmental Health Sciences, is researching the different ways our bodies are being exposed to plastics. He says there is evidence that nanoparticles, not necessarily derived from plastics, can cause our immune system to respond at a cellular level. Thomas thinks if there is a potential for plastics to harm us, it will be once they have been reduced to those tiny “nano-sized” pieces that could pass through the wall of the gut. Unfortunately, he says, those particles are so small they’re very hard to measure. So what does his gut tell him about the potential for harm from microplastics? “It’s a very tough question,” says Thomas. “Personally, I think there’s little risk to our health based on what we know ... but then, who knows what we might find in the future. “I eat seafood, for example, but I don’t use plastic chopping boards at home. “But I would advocate avoiding plastics and reducing our reliance on them. Releasing plastics into our environment like we are is unacceptable.” Browne says he has sympathy for the public, who just want answers. “My suggestion is that we need to be managing and reducing our exposure to these polymers and plastics. There’s enough evidence of harm that we should be doing that.” What about the environment? There are wide-ranging concerns about the impacts of microplastics on our environment, in particular on our marine wildlife. But as with impacts on humans, it is a challenge for scientists to tease out the impacts of microplastics from all the other things that animals are exposed to. Lauren Roman, at CSIRO oceans and atmosphere, says that for all animals “the size of the plastic matters”. “If the piece is too big, the animal won’t eat it or, in the case of seabirds, they will regurgitate it. If it’s very small then it can just pass straight through them.” For larger pieces, Roman says there is some evidence that plastic accumulating in the stomachs of animals can suppress their appetite – known as the “dietary dilution effect” that could have knock-on effects. Roman says while chemicals associated with the plastics – such as pthalates and brominated flame retardants – have been detected in the tissues of animals, “we don’t know yet if they are affecting the health of the animal”. Around the world, researchers are only now beginning to examine the impacts of plastics on the health of animals, after a swathe of studies identified the many species that were interacting with microplastics. “But we should definitely be concerned,” Roman says. “For seabirds, we have these pieces smaller than 5mm getting stuck in the gut and causing death. And all the very big pieces will break up into smaller ones. “The fact that nothing serious has been found yet suggests to me that we must be looking for small effects and, remember, that we are exposed to lots of things in our lives. Is this something to get our knickers in a knot about? I’m not sure.” What should we do? The experts the Guardian spoke to agreed a wise step here is to reduce our use and exposure to plastics. From an environmental perspective, campaigners say we should be cutting out unnecessary plastic use, including single-use items, and substituting plastics where we can. But Browne also had words of caution. “If we are going to do that, we should make sure that as we intercept or redesign products we don’t cause more problems,” he says. “Remembering that some asbestos was used in clothing – it’s a natural fibre but it causes all sorts of serious issues for people.”
50	“In an ideal world, what would you like me to do?” “Get her clean and find her a home.” Emergency services found her in a park under the influence of drugs and alcohol, scraped, bruised and incontinent. For two days her name is listed as “Unknown Unknown” until she wakes up and the nurses don gown and mask to scrub the dirt out from under her fingernails and drown her calloused skin in moisturiser. When she has wolfed down an extra breakfast, they sit her by a cheery window with sunshine streaming through. This is where I meet her, silently praising the nurses who have transformed her. I ask her how she’s feeling. “Much better, thank you,” she replies. She holds out the arm which had gone limp in the park due to the way she slept on it. An infection requiring intravenous antibiotics has also improved. As I examine her with my residents, I am struck by her politeness and even a certain humility. The notes say that at just 30 years, she has a stubborn drug habit, a chronic mental illness and has been in and out of jail. And she is homeless. Patients like her can be argumentative, wary and seemingly ungrateful. They are always on their guard, as if waiting to be blamed. But she is different – quiet, self-contained, almost reflective. An urgent imperative in any public hospital is to start thinking about discharge destination as soon as the patient arrives. We will summon the usual services including social work, psychiatry and addiction medicine, but they will all want to know a plan. “When you’re better, where will you go?” “My friend’s place.” “Really?” I have seen many such non-arrangements in my time. “If not, my dad will take me.” At this, I relax. The fallback on a parent works out more often than not but I make a mental note to talk to her father. Two days later, when he arrives, her father is visibly irritated at the idea of discharging her at all. He says we can’t “prove” that her infection has settled. I respond politely that on this, my clinical judgment is backed by tests heading in the right direction. The infection might recur, he presses. That’s a risk for anyone, I concede, but the answer is not to prolong a hospital stay or to give unnecessary antibiotics. Other people stay much longer, he argues. Each patient hopefully stays only for as long as necessary, I reason. Now his eyes take on a new desperation. Asking to speak to me alone, he implores me to do something because he can’t have his daughter at the mercy of the elements and drug dealers. Out on the streets, there is no food, no safety, no doctor. He seeks a guaranteed admission to crisis accommodation but of course, this isn’t how such places work. We both know that many homeless individuals and families are turned away due to a lack of space. “Worst of all,” he says, “we have no way of being in touch. She rarely finds a phone to call me. In between, I have no idea.” As a mother, this lament pierces my heart, and I decide that this poor woman really needs a whole new beginning. A new home, a new education, a new outlook, new friends. It would be a slow process but with a potential 50 years of life ahead, it would be a worthwhile investment. But my thinking is drowned by the insistent reminders to make room for those who have spent a night on an emergency department trolley. These are people who have suffered a stroke or heart attack where timely intervention saves lives. People with an acute psychotic episode or vegetative depression who can’t possibly go home. The elderly, often cognitively and physically impaired, who will spend months in hospital while we undertake the tedious paperwork of residential care placement because incredibly, no one anticipated this. Of course, all these patients deserve our help but when we only focus on them, we inevitably let down the ones who are medically “stable” but whose other problems make them the most unstable of all. Even as we care for her with all our energy, we try to not judge. Why does she buy drugs? Why does she make poor decisions? How does she end up in jail? We don’t know enough but what we do know is that untreated mental illness and homelessness make a destructive combination with many downstream effects. Personal responsibility is helped by the right circumstances. Such patients are no stranger to the public hospital system which is obliged to open its doors to allcomers. What then is our social contract with them? Perhaps there isn’t one. Perhaps the raison d’etre of a public hospital is to treat medical illness and accept that entrenched poverty, homelessness, drug addiction and chronic mental health issues are simply beyond our remit. This would certainly ease our conscience, but it doesn’t seem right, especially when such patients are the most likely to return to our doors, each time a little sicker, a little more expensive and time-consuming. The truth is, medical illness cannot be separated from socioeconomic factors, which is why good healthcare needs better out-of-hospital supports. Midway through my conversation with the father, it dawns on me that not once has he broached the subject of taking his daughter home, something that she will need to know too. This means explicitly ruling out the option. I feel a little sad but not knowing the facts, frame my question in the most nonjudgmental way possible. “I understand she will not be going home with you.” “No.” No explanation is offered, none is requested. Later, I return to the patient. If she feels let down, she doesn’t show it. To me, she looks ashamed at all the attention and a little overwhelmed by the problems that face her. “What else can I do?” I ask her. “Don’t worry about it,” she says softly. “I’ll get by.” I ask her to stay another night, hoping that a solution will present itself the next morning. But early that morning, she signs herself out. There is no doctor to send a discharge summary to, but the formality must be completed. Under presenting illness, it says: “Homeless patient found unconscious in local park.” Under management, we write: “Treatment of infection with antibiotics and fluids.” Lastly, under follow-up: “Patient left at own risk. Destination unknown. Unable to arrange services.” • Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar. Her latest book is called A Better Death
51	The New South Wales government is considering legislation that could limit the ability for planning authorities to rule out coalmines projects based on the climate change impact of emissions from the coal once it is burned. It comes after a campaign from the NSW Minerals Council over decisions that have referenced the impact of “scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions” as a reason for either rejecting a mining project entirely or for imposing conditions on it. For a coalmine, scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are from the burning of the coal after it is sold into the market, including overseas. The planning minister, Rob Stokes, said it was “not appropriate for state governments to impose conditions about emissions policies in other countries”. He said the government was looking at a range of options, including legislation or a new guideline for how planning authorities should factor scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions into the assessment process. The recent decisions include the NSW land and environment court’s rejection of the Rocky Hill coalmine in February, which cited the impact the mine would have on climate change, including through the burning of coal in other countries, at a time when “a rapid and deep decrease” in global emissions was urgently needed. In August, the NSW Independent Planning Commission approved the expanded United Wambo coal project near Singleton but as a condition said the coal could only be exported to countries that have ratified the Paris agreement. In September the commission rejected the development of a greenfield coalmine in NSW’s Bylong Valley, citing the impact the mine would have on groundwater, agricultural land and on climate change. The NSW Minerals Council has since launched attack ads that target the planning system for “failing the people of NSW”. In a statement last week, the council’s chief executive Stephen Galilee said the decision to launch a campaign came after months of “warnings to the minister for planning and others in the government about the risk of the planning system to jobs and investment”. He said the situation had reached “crisis point” with the Bylong Valley decision. Stokes said the Minerals Council was one of the stakeholders the government was consulting in its development of a policy on scope 3 emissions. “We are working with key stakeholders, including the federal government, NSW Minerals Council and consent authorities, to develop a clear policy direction as quickly as possible to provide certainty to the community, industry and investors,” he said. “We are looking at a range of options including legislation.” The consent authorities in this instance include the NSW land and environment court. But environment groups are warning the government not to bow to pressure from the mining industry. Lock the Gate said the impact of downstream greenhouse gas emissions “is arguably the most complicated, severe and lasting environmental impact of NSW’ export coalmines”. Lock the Gate coordinator George Woods said the public should also have a say in how planning decisions address the climate consequences of coal developments and that should be done through a public hearing process run by the independent planning commission. “It’s disappointing and frankly dangerous for the planning minister to narrowly consult only with the mining industry on a matter of profound importance like this,” she said. “The mining industry has flexed its political muscle but the government really needs to address the bigger issue and the public sentiment on this.” Elaine Johnson, the principal lawyer with the Environmental Defenders Office of NSW, which represented Groundswell Gloucester in the Rocky Hill case, said if the government was planning changes to the way planning authorities consider scope 3 emissions, the consultation for that should be broad and include other key stakeholders such as community and environment groups. “The land and environment court, in the Rocky Hill decision, has confirmed that it is entirely appropriate for decision-makers to impose conditions on projects that will contribute to dangerous climate change in a planning context,” Johnson said. She said that was recognised by the independent planning commission in the United Wambo and Bylong Valley assessments. “We would also say that in 2019 we are making planning decisions in a context which includes advice from the world’s best scientists that we’re approaching a climate emergency,” she said. “If global emissions continue to rise and if serious action is not taken at all levels of government, by communities and business, the impacts of dangerous climate change will be catastrophic.” The NSW Minerals Council said recent independent planning commission decisions related to emissions generated in other countries were “inconsistent with the Paris agreement and its associated greenhouse gas accounting framework”. “The NSW government has attempted to clarify its policy on scope 3 emissions through correspondence to the IPC but this has been disregarded,” Galilee told Guardian Australia. “The NSW government must therefore provide legislative and policy certainty on this issue.”
52	A majority of Australians believe Scott Morrison was wrong to snub the United Nations climate summit while on a high-profile visit to the US, but have otherwise backed the prime minister’s handling of the relationship with Donald Trump. The latest Guardian Essential poll, taken in the wake of Morrison’s trip to the US last week, shows that most Australians believe it is important for the prime minister to have a good relationship with the US president, “whoever they might be” for the good of the nation. While 15% of people disagreed with the statement, 77% agreed, with men and Liberal voters most likely to back a strong relationship. The survey of 1,097 people was taken before Tuesday’s revelation that Australia had agreed to help investigate the genesis of the Mueller inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US election, which Trump has suggested was a “hoax” to bring him down. But while 57% of those surveyed agreed that Morrison had shown “good diplomacy skills” during his official visit to US, 70% said that he should have joined other world leaders in attending the UN climate summit in New York, which was attended by foreign affairs minister Marise Payne rather than Morrison. About 40% of people strongly agreed that Morrison should have fronted up to the climate summit, with a further 31% saying they somewhat agreed. A breakdown of voting intentions of those who believed the prime minister should have attended the summit – where Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg delivered an impassioned speech to world leaders – shows that 78% of Labor voters thought he should have shown up, compared with 64% of Coalition voters. Morrison defended Australia’s record on climate change at a separate speech to the UN, but observers at the summit said his failure to attend despite being in the US had eroded goodwill for the country on the issue. Voters were also asked whether a good relationship between Morrison and Trump “reflects badly” on Australia, a sentiment that 38% of people agreed with, with 48% disagreeing. Greens voters were most likely to be critical of the relationship forged between Morrison and Trump, with 60% saying it was a bad look, compared with 27% of Coalition voters and 48% of Labor voters. But while most people were supportive of the US alliance and Morrison’s handling of Trump, just 32% believe his presidency, which has sparked global geopolitical uncertainty, has been good for Australia, with 49% of people disagreeing. Australia’s recent decision to assist the US in the Strait of Hormuz, in what it said would be “modest, meaningful and time-limited” commitment, was supported by 51% of those surveyed and opposed by 35%. But more people were concerned (57%) that the engagement could plunge Australia into another conflict in the near future as a result. Liberal voters were more supportive of Australia’s engagement in the Middle East and less concerned about future conflict in the region. The Essential poll also gauged voter sentiment on the state of the Australian economy ahead of Tuesday’s decision by the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates to a record low 0.75%. Views were mixed, with an equal third believing the economy was in a good state (32%), poor state (33%) or neither good nor poor (32%). Compared with May last year, more people felt the economy was in a poor state, up nine percentage points and edging closer to the December 2016 high of 36%. Liberal voters were more likely to be positive in their assessment of the economy, with 45% saying it was in “very good” or “quite good” shape. When asked which indicators were most important in assessing the health of the economy, most people pointed to the unemployment rate, which increased to 5.3% in August from 5.2% in the previous month, as well as the cost of household bills. Half of those who think the national budget surplus is the best indicator for economic performance believe the economy is in a good shape, whereas those who look at household bills to gauge economic strength were the most pessimistic.
53	Whether retirement is in your distant or not so distant future, it’s worth carving out some time to manage your superannuation. Xavier O’Halloran, acting director of the Superannuation Consumers’ Centre at Choice, explains how you can make the biggest impact in a single afternoon. 1.30pm: Figure out where your super is hiding Many Australians have to log into MyGov, the government’s online services portal, to manage things like their taxes. The service also has a record of all of your superannuation accounts – and there might be several. You can see all of your superannuation accounts by clicking on the ATO section of the site. “Every time you start a new job, unless you’re paying attention, you basically get set up with a new account,” O’Halloran says. “That means you’re paying two sets of fees, two sets of insurance policies. And they estimate that that will cost you across a lifetime about $50,000 in retirement savings if you don’t consolidate them.” In the super tab of MyGov, you’ll see the details of every super account you’ve ever had, including inactive ones. 1.45pm: Choose where to consolidate Once you know where your super is, you need to pick the right fund to consolidate into. “This is where it gets a little bit tougher, because at the moment, there’s not really any good information out there,” O’Halloran explains. When researching your super accounts – or deciding whether or not to switch to a new one altogether – there are two factors to keep in mind: fees and returns. With fees, O’Halloran has a simple rule of thumb: “Anything over 1% in fees per year [is] on the expensive side.” Because super compounds over time, tiny variations in fees can have a significant impact. “If you’re talking about a half per cent difference in fees, across the entire lifetime, that’s about $100,000.” It’s easy to find out what sort of fees a super fund charges using something called a product dashboard. If you Google a super fund’s name and “product dashboard” you’ll be able to find a “one pager” that’s “basically a little cheat sheet that you can use to figure out what the fees are”. When it comes to assessing your fund’s returns, O’Halloran suggests looking at the “medium to long term” – how the fund has performed over the past five to 10 years. “Don’t be looking at what happened last year, because funds and markets change really rapidly. You want to look at consistent performance.” Choice has recently released a tool that allows you to search superannuation funds based on their five-year net returns. If your super fund is in the bottom 25% it might be a supervillain of super. “There’s a few in there that probably you don’t want to be in. Unless you’re looking for something really particular with those funds.” One particular reason to go with a low-return fund is risk level. People on the verge of retirement “shouldn’t be in a really high-risk option because if the market suddenly crashes, they’ll be really badly off”. Not all low-return funds are low risk, so if you’re close to retirement, risk is worth researching too. If you’re younger “you can go high risk. You can ride the bumps of the market, because you’re still 20 or 30 years away from retirement date.” 2.45pm: Switch if you have to, consolidate if you don’t If none of the super funds you’re already with offer favourable fees or competitive returns, switching is not complicated. “You can do it online, most of the time. It’s just a matter of providing your tax file number. And you can even as part of that process, ask them to auto consolidate all your existing accounts into the new one. So instead of going through MyGov, you can just do it that way.” If you are happy with one of your existing super accounts, through MyGov “you can basically auto-consolidate in one click”. 3pm: Think about your insurance “A quarter of people don’t know that they’ve got insurance through their superannuation,” O’Halloran says. Because you’re “automatically signed up”, the insurance policy you’re on may not suit your needs. If you have no dependents, you might be paying for death insurance you don’t need. Low-income earners might be covered for income protection and total and permanent disability insurance (a payout you’ll get if something bad happens that means you can never work again) that “other safety nets … like government support pensions” might cover, which “you wouldn’t be paying any extra for … Because they’re provided to everyone.” If you set up an online account with your superannuation provider, it is relatively easy to check what you’re insured for, and how much it’s costing you. “Then there’s usually just an option to cancel in the website, which is not too difficult in the ones that we’ve seen.” However, O’Halloran cautions against completely cancelling the insurance that comes with your superannuation – even if you don’t need it right now – because if you apply for insurance separately, or reapply through your super fund later on, you may have to complete medical tests which will look for pre-existing conditions. “It’s not apples and apples, but for the most part [insurance] will be a little bit cheaper within super.” If you do have a pre-existing condition and cancel your superannuation fund’s insurance “there’s a bit of a risk … it could knock you out from having cover altogether”. So, rather than cancelling your insurance, it’s better to think about your stage of life, look at what your super covers you for, and make tweaks to lower (or raise) your coverage depending on your individual needs. The kind of insurance you require will also depend on how risky your job is. Those that work in construction, mining and forestry will have different insurance needs, and costs, to those engaged in lower-risk desk jobs. 3.45pm: Plan for the future Once you’ve consolidated your super in the right kind of account, and checked that your insurance is tailored to your needs, the final thing to consider is your contributions. “The way the system is designed at the moment, if you’ve been making the compulsory contributions your whole life, you’ll probably get to retirement with a pretty similar level of income to … what you had during your working life. So you’ll probably have a pretty similar standard of living.” But, O’Halloran cautions, that level of super is predicated upon the assumption that you own your own home: “So if you are not getting into the housing market, or you had breaks in your working life, throughout your retirement balance is probably going to be a bit lower than what you have been living on up until retirement.” If you do have additional income to spare, asking your employer to increase your pre-tax super contribution is “pretty much the best tax dodge that exists out there. You’re only paying 15% on your contributions, whereas otherwise you paying whatever your marginal tax rate is.” If you’re on the average wage in Australia, or more, your tax “is going to be higher than that”. You can make up concessional, salary sacrificed contributions to your super of up to $25,000 a year, and if you’re on a salary of less than $52,697 per year, the government may make a matching contribution to after-tax superannuation deposits. Contributing more to your superannuation won’t always make sense, “if you’re struggling to get by, making extra super contributions is really not the right thing to be doing”. But “if you’ve got a bit of extra money kicking around it’s a great way to save for the future”. 4.30pm: Make yourself a snack, you’re done.
54	A Sicilian windfarm businessman, known as the “king of wind”, has been sentenced to nine years in prison for bankrolling the No 1 mafia fugitive, Matteo Messina Denaro. Vito Nicastri, a former electrician from Alcamo in the province of Trapani, was one of the key funders of Denaro’s long spell on the run, a judge in Palermo ruled on Tuesday. In 2013, Nicastri, who was under house arrest, lost his companies, property, cars and boats after anti-mafia investigators ordered the definitive confiscation of his assets worth €1.3bn (£1.1bn). Among the assets were 43 companies, 98 properties, 66 bank accounts, credit cards, investment funds, cars and boats. Most were located in Sicily and Calabria. Investigators said Nicastri, who made his name as an alternative energy entrepreneur, had invested money made from criminal activities and had “high-level” contacts in the mafia and “close ties to Matteo Messina Denaro”. According to prosecutors, Nicastri allegedly acted as a middleman between local bosses and corrupt politicians, securing all the permits required to build and deliver hundreds of windfarm turbines to Spanish, Danish and Maltese operators, with profits finding their way back to Denaro. Described as “the last Mohican of the old mafia”, Denaro is one of the world’s most wanted fugitives, who has been in hiding since 1993. He was once considered a candidate to be the Sicilian mafia’s boss of bosses after the deaths of Bernardo Provenzano in 2016 and Salvatore Riina in 2017. Denaro, 57, who infamously claimed: “I filled a cemetery all by myself”, has apparently kept up his luxurious lifestyle, thanks to his several bankrollers who, according to prosecutors, include politicians and businessmen. Investigators have long claimed that the boss, wanted for more than 50 murders, is being shielded by powerful Freemasons in Trapani.
55	﻿The US attorney general met UK intelligence agencies in the summer to discuss Britain potentially cooperating with Donald Trump’s administration on an inquiry examining the FBI’s investigation into alleged collusion with Russia, according to sources. William Barr met British intelligence officials in London on 29 July at a meeting attended by intelligence agencies from the Five Eyes group. He was accompanied by the US homeland security department’s acting deputy secretary, David Pekoske. The meeting was formally about the risks and opportunities of new technologies but Barr also raised his inquiries into the FBI investigation. A Whitehall official said the issue of UK cooperation was discussed informally and only on the margins of the meeting. US officials have said Barr’s role is confined to ensuring that the official inquiry team members are introduced to the right people. It has been reported that Barr is pressing a range of foreign powers to cooperate with his effort to piece together the origins of the FBI investigation into the Trump campaign’s links with Russia. Barr’s critics claim he is seeking to discredit the FBI investigation by constructing a vast conspiracy theory that foreign powers were working to secure Hillary Clinton’s election in 2016. The inquiry by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, showed that Russia was attempting to swing the presidential election in favour of Trump. Barr’s counter-attack has been given an added urgency as Trump seeks to find a way to block potential impeachment hearings. The president is facing claims he threatened to withdraw military aid from Ukraine unless it cooperated with his efforts to find dirt on the former US vice-president Joe Biden, a potential challenger in the 2020 presidential election. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, began a brief visit to Italy on Tuesday, days after Barr had been in Rome seeking details of what cooperation the Italians may have given to the FBI inquiry. It was reported on Monday that Pompeo had taken part in Trump’s controversial call to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Pompeo also wrote to the House foreign affairs committee rejecting demands from House Democrats for five current and former state department officials to testify before committees investigating the Ukraine scandal. Trump is openly urging his aides to get information from Italy, the UK and Ukraine, reports have said. The president has said: “It’s the greatest hoax, probably, in the history of our country and somebody has to get to the bottom of it.” Trump’s administration has mounted two investigations into whether overseas agencies played a role in investigating his 2016 campaign. The first inquiry, led by the justice department inspector general, Michael Horowitz – now completed but unpublished – focussed narrowly on the background to the granting of a surveillance warrant in 2016 on the Trump campaign member Carter Page. The second review, set up by Barr in May and led by the US attorney John Durham, is looking at the origins of the Russia investigation, including whether there was bias against the Trump administration among senior officials in the security services. Unlike Horowitz’s review, Durham’s has the power to convene a grand jury and subpoena people outside the government. The degree to which overseas intelligence agencies are dutybound to cooperate with the inquiry is unclear. One UK government source said: “The intelligence relationship is so close that there is no need to pressurise the UK to cooperate.” The Australian government has disclosed that it agreed formally in writing to cooperate, and it is known the former MI6 officer Christopher Steele cooperated extensively with Horowitz. He agreed to be interviewed by US justice department officials in London over his role in preparing a dossier on collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. His evidence was in effect given under oath. Durham has not been in touch with Steele, it is understood. By coincidence, he was interviewed in the week that Trump conducted a state visit to the UK in June. Steele, through his lawyers, had been reluctant to be cross-examined, but was told the UK intelligence services had no objections. The interview focused on Steele’s knowledge of Russian interference efforts globally, his intelligence collection methods and his findings about Page, whom the FBI ultimately surveilled. Steele had previously met a two-person FBI team from the office of Mueller, whose report on Russian interference in the 2016 election was published in April. Around the same time as the most recent Steele interview, it was known that Trump was threatening to end the historically close cooperation between the British and the US intelligence services. That threat, first made in public by Pompeo in February, was linked to a US warning that it could not cooperate with an intelligence agency that allowed the Chinese-owned telecoms company Huawei access to UK 5G networks. Trump withdrew the threat at a press conference with Theresa May after he met her and the then foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, privately to discuss the issue, despite there being no apparent change of position from the UK on Huawei. The president would have known by then that Steele was cooperating with his justice department inquiry. Asked if Washington was ready to “impose limits on intelligence sharing”, the US president replied: “No, because we are going to have absolutely an agreement on Huawei and everything else. We have an incredible intelligence relationship and we will be able to work out any differences.” Barr’s visit to Italy largely stemmed from claims by the former Trump aide George Papadopoulos that Italy holds the key to identifying the source of alleged smears against Trump in 2016. Papadopoulos, briefly a member of the advisory committee for foreign policy in the Trump election campaign, told the then Australian high commissioner to the UK, Alexander Downer, in 2016 that Russia possessed emails hacked from Democratic party servers that were damaging to Clinton. Papadopoulos later claimed he was set up. Downer passed the information to the FBI, helping prompt the investigation led by Mueller. Speaking to Australian radio, Downer refused to add to previous comments about his meeting with Papadopoulos. “I’ve just got nothing more to say about it,” he told ABC Radio National. “I mean, I had a conversation with this guy, I passed on the conversation or that one element of the conversation to the Americans and there’s just nothing more to it. I can’t offer you any more information.” Papadopoulos has served a jail sentence for lying to the FBI about claims a Maltese academic, Joseph Mifsud, was the source of his information on Russia. He has said without evidence that Mifsud is an agent of the Italian secret service, and sought to entrap him. Mifsud has been missing for two years. Papadopoulos had made a series of allegations about Downer’s motives. However, Downer is a conservative, a supporter of Brexit, and not seen as a man to try to deliberately undermine Trump for political purposes. The UK Foreign Office said in a statement: “Investigations in the US are a matter for the US authorities. We won’t comment on the ongoing investigations.”
56	Diane Abbott will become the first minority ethnic parliamentarian to represent their party at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, when the shadow home secretary stands in for Jeremy Corbyn. Boris Johnson will be in Manchester delivering his speech at Conservative party conference when the weekly clash is due to take place, leaving the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, to deputise. The House of Commons voted against suspending parliament for the duration of the four-day conference, but Johnson’s party pressed ahead with the gathering. Corbyn’s regular stand-in, Emily Thornberry, was dropped earlier this year after the shadow foreign secretary was fiercely critical of Labour’s campaign for the European elections in May, in which the party won just 14% of the vote. Speaking during election night coverage, Thornberry said: “We went into an election where the most important issue was what was our view on leaving the European Union and we were not clear about it. We were not clear on the one single thing that people wanted to hear.” She insisted during last week’s Labour conference that she believed her party should say in advance of a general election that it would campaign for remain in a future referendum – a policy that was rejected by the Labour leader and by party members on the conference floor. In June, it was the shadow environment secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, widely considered a potential leadership candidate, who stood in for the Labour leader. Announcing that Abbott would take his place for this week’s clash, Corbyn highlighted the fact that Abbott’s appearance would take place during Black History Month. A close longtime ally of the Labour leader, she has represented her Hackney North and Stoke Newington seat since 1987. Johnson has faced only one PMQs since arriving in Downing Street in July. He was criticised last week for the forceful language he used in a series of fierce clashes with Labour MPs.
57	The law and order policies unveiled this week by the home secretary, Priti Patel, and the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, are instructive not only for what they reveal about their party’s approach to criminal justice, but also to any upcoming election. Creating 10,000 new prison places, scrapping a plan to replace short sentences with community punishments and changing sentencing rules so that violent criminals are locked up for longer, are not part of any evidence-led platform. While the reversal of cuts in police numbers is welcome, and the extension of a scheme allowing members of the public to challenge sentences perceived as overly lenient is reasonable, elsewhere victims’ concerns were used as a fig leaf for a raft of measures that amount to a pitch for votes. The UK’s prisons are at breaking point, with every inspection report a litany of overcrowding, filth, drug use and violence, and last week’s disturbance at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire was only the latest in a series of similar episodes. The courts and wider justice system face growing problems, even if these are often hidden from public view. Partly these are a consequence of cuts to police, courts, legal aid and Crown Prosecution Service budgets, but also other factors including the complexities surrounding digital evidence. The part-privatisation of the probation service by the former justice secretary Chris Grayling is acknowledged to have been a disaster – although it remains unclear whether the plan devised by David Gauke to sort it out will be any better. Reoffending rates are high. One-tenth of offenders are released not knowing where they will spend the night. County lines drug gangs, singled out by Ms Patel as a scourge, are a complex problem. So is the falling number of convictions for rape. Yet while she offered new resources for dealing with drug gangs, her speech was notable for its lack of original ideas. Its “tough on crime” formula contained nothing that would have surprised Margaret Thatcher. The world has moved on since the 1980s. Among European countries, England and Wales have more people imprisoned than any other country bar Poland – due in part to the approach pursued during the 1990s under New Labour. Scandinavian countries have far better records on rehabilitation and lower rates of offending. Even in the US, mass incarceration has critics on the right as well as the left. Under David Cameron and Theresa May, the Conservatives too were moving away from the most kneejerk, tabloid-pleasing reflexes, including by investing in new prisons – even if austerity undermined every attempt at progressive policymaking. This is what makes the punitive, retro rhetoric not just misguided but shameless: after almost a decade in power, the Conservatives, and particularly the former justice secretary Michael Gove, know better. Yes, some people do wicked things and must be punished. But if part of prison’s purpose is to send people back out into society with something to contribute, not only does it not work; it frequently makes things worse. Many people, as well as politicians, know this. They know too about the over-representation in the prison population of ethnic minorities (particularly black men and boys); of people with mental illnesses, learning disabilities and histories of abuse, abandonment and addiction. But Mr Johnson’s Conservatives appear not to care. Their overriding goal seems to be power, and they have identified a macho stance on law and order as one way to help them hold on to it. Ms Patel’s ridiculous promise to terrify criminals is just one of the ways in which they threaten to take the country backwards.
58	A suspected drug gangster who slashed an innocent man to death in a bar and went on the run overseas for three and a half years has been convicted of murder. Shane O’Brien, 31, fled Britain after chartering a private plane and became one of the world’s most wanted fugitives, hoping his extensive criminal connections would shield him from justice. On Tuesday he was finally convicted of murdering 21-year-old council roads planner Josh Hanson in a crowded west London bar in 2015. O’Brien showed “pitiless savagery”, the Old Bailey heard, after he slashed Hanson with a knife, leaving him with a 37cm wound from his left ear to right chest, as his girlfriend and horrified revellers looked on. CCTV showed O’Brien hiding a Stanley knife behind his back as he confronted his victim, then inflicting the catastrophic injuries. He strolled out of the bar calmly and fled London, sparking an immediate police manhunt. The next evening O’Brien went for a night on the town. DCI Noel McHugh, who led the hunt for O’Brien, said the CCTV his team recovered showed O’Brien’s callousness, revealing he had gone shopping to try on designer clothes shortly after the murder. “What we saw was astounding. You would never know this man had just killed another in cold blood,” said McHugh. “O’Brien was seen casually enjoying a curry with a friend, posing in front of a mirror, even getting the leftovers in a bag to go and then spending a couple of hours at Ashford Designer Outlet. “You’d think a man in his position might quickly grab the first thing on the shelf and make off, but no, as CCTV shows, he carefully selected and tried on trousers and shirts, even asking a shop assistant for help with collar sizing at one point. Always paying in cash – he was careful about that!” O’Brien paid for a private four-seater plane from Biggin Hill airport in south-east London, where he was able to fly out of the United Kingdom without a passport. McHugh said: “The fact he is a man who can arrange at the drop of a hat for a privately hired plane to whisk him away without a passport speaks volumes about his connections and criminal links.” O’Brien, who was unemployed and had no bank account, is believed to have been involved in the drug trade. McHugh said: “The man who chartered the plane and accompanied O’Brien out of the UK was later convicted of importing 100kg of heroin and cocaine, along with 30 of those encrypted phones. The pilots were convicted in the Netherlands of importing more than 90kg of heroin. O’Brien had some interesting friends. “It was a theme throughout the investigation: O’Brien’s ability to travel on false documentation and undetected through countries, using private planes and highly encrypted phones costing £3,000 apiece.” O’Brien spent more than three years in Europe avoiding capture, and earned the title of one of the most wanted men in the world. His criminal connections got him false documents but in 2017 he got into a scuffle in Prague and was arrested. However, police there did not know who he was as he was using an alias and O’Brien fled after being bailed. In March 2019 O’Brien was arrested in Romania and extradited to the UK on a European arrest warrant. At the Old Bailey on Tuesday the jury took just 55 minutes to reject as lies O’Brien’s defence that his victim had provoked him and he had only meant to scare Hanson after the two men came across each other in the bar in Hillingdon. Josh’s mother, Tracey Hanson, said after the conviction: “The aftermath of Josh’s murder has left us broken beyond repair as Josh was taken from us in the most horrific way possible, suddenly, abruptly, viciously and violently, and nothing will ever erase the CCTV footage of Josh’s final moments from our minds as he was struck with a knife so horrifically and callously, along with his suffering as he tried to fight for his life.” O’Brien will be sentenced on 17 October and faces a mandatory life sentence.
59	Last month Germany’s version of the Sun, Bild, ran a sensationalist attack on the outgoing president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi. Depicting the central banker as “Count Draghila”, replete with vampirish teeth and velvet collar, the article portrayed the ECB boss as a fiend sucking the bank accounts of German savers dry of billions of euros with low interest rates. A day later the tabloid interviewed the head of the German central bank to ram the message home under the headline “Is our money in danger?”. There is an undoubted perception across Europe’s largest economy that the ECB was penalising savers through easy money policies that have given populists a stick to beat mainstream politicians with. However, the release of the latest economic data shows that Mr Draghi was right and German sentiment was wrong. It is increasingly clear the risk of recession in Europe is rising. Growth is sputtering while inflation is falling. The eurozone manufacturing sector suffered its worst month in seven years while inflation dropped to a three-year low. Mr Draghi has for years attempted to resuscitate the eurozone’s sluggish economy through monetary means. Last month the ECB lowered interest rates further into negative territory and restarted the ECB programme of buying bonds. Yet as one economist perceptively put it, the problem for the eurozone is that “weak credit growth is driven by the lack of demand from creditworthy borrowers rather than the supply cost of finance”. This can be solved in part by governments stepping up to boost demand in the eurozone. Mr Draghi is right to say it is no longer tenable to claim that monetary policy alone can deal with the entrenched problems of the continental economy. Instead he correctly called for fiscal policy to become the main economic instrument to sustain demand in the eurozone. Nineteen countries in the European Union use the euro as their currency. Yet for all sorts of reasons Europe has denied governments the ability to use their budgets to boost demand. The diverging priorities of various parts of the euro area add to the dilemma: Germany has low levels of unemployment but a third of young workers are unemployed in Italy and Spain. While core economies are worried about cheap money fuelling runaway house prices, the ones on the periphery suffer from high borrowing costs. That is why Mr Draghi’s necessary call is provocative. In the face of the threats to the EU there ought to be much more engagement with people’s angst and dislocation. Mr Draghi’s replacement, Christine Lagarde, says fiscal policy is required “to respond to the threat of populism”. In the EU, France’s Emmanuel Macron deserves credit for recognising two years ago that “Europe’s fiscal policy is too restrictive … and our jobless are paying the price”. Despite enacting painful reforms at home to win Germany over to his cause, Mr Macron unfortunately failed to get agreement for a eurozone fiscal capacity big enough to offer meaningful stimulus that would be funded by a share of taxation currently going to national budgets. Instead of a bazooka with hundreds of billions of euros in funding, in June eurozone nations could only agree a peashooter of a fund worth €17bn. Perhaps fiscal policy at the eurozone level ought not to be run along German lines. It would be better if onerous fiscal rules for nations on borrowing and debt were relaxed. Since 2008 there has been a growing political divide. To bridge this requires a shift in the balance of power and thinking within Europe to promote cohesion and solidarity. Politicians must seize an opportunity from the continent’s ongoing economic trouble.
60	In a normal game of poker, a bluff cannot continue once it is called. But for Boris Johnson an exposed bluff can just be re-bluffed. The stakes get higher even when the poor hand lies open on the table. Before entering Downing Street, Johnson claimed that deficiencies in Theresa May’s Brexit deal were caused by failure of nerve, not weakness in the UK’s position. The theory was that Brussels needed to see kamikaze intent in British eyes: total commitment to quitting the bloc with no deal. Only then would the cowardly continentals yield. It is true that the EU wants a deal, because of the harm that Brexit without one would do. But the harm is asymmetric. In a no-deal scenario, the UK suffers more and, after a period of gratuitous pain, returns to negotiations with diminished leverage. It was never a real bluff because the economic cards were dealt face up. Johnson’s posturing has not been without result. It has drained meagre stores of goodwill and increased eagerness to see the exit door swing shut behind Britain. That is bad news for remainers. The Brussels caravan is moving on. The European parliament opened confirmation hearings for Ursula von der Leyen’s commission this week, and there is no British nominee. In December the Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, replaces the great anglophile Donald Tusk as president of the European council. The dynamics of EU summitry are shifting. Angela Merkel is in her political twilight; Emmanuel Macron is in his pomp. The German chancellor is an advocate of patience with British indecision; her French counterpart is not. In Italy, Matteo Salvini’s far-right League has been expelled from government. In Austria, the 33-year-old conservative Sebastian Kurz triumphed in elections on Sunday at the expense of the xenophobic Freedom party. These are subtle shifts, not some tidal movement away from populism and nationalism, but they add to the feeling of seasonal change in Brussels. Brexit is seen as a tedious legacy issue. Johnson’s end-of-the-pier Donald Trump tribute act looks tired already. Most EU leaders would be glad if the UK ended up renewing its European vows in a second referendum, but none is trying to engineer that outcome. Only paranoid Brexiteers see foreign plots to keep plucky Albion in the bloc against its will. The salient question in Brussels is not how to revive the gangrenous member, but how to manage its safe amputation. Reaching a deal looks tricky. Getting it through parliament before 31 October is close to impossible. Opposition MPs have been radicalised by the whole prorogation episode – the prime minister’s brazen disregard for law and provocative refusal to apologise. Johnson’s domestic strategy is not really compatible with sound international diplomacy. To woo supporters of Nigel Farage’s Brexit party, he casts the EU as a hostile power to which patriots never surrender. And Farage will depict any deal as craven capitulation. Even if the bar were not set too high by the need to satisfy implacable Faragists, there are vast obstacles to mutual comprehension across the Channel. Johnson wants to take the UK out of the EU customs union, which cannot be done without border inspections and infrastructure. In the context of Northern Ireland, that means a level of security intrusion that was banished by the Good Friday agreement, and which no one who cares about peace would want to see restored. Hard Brexiteers say this problem can be solved with barcode scanners, GPS trackers and discreet checks miles away from the border. The EU keeps telling them they are wrong. Technology works for tracking goods that have been declared under the rules. But a working customs border needs enforcement, which means stopping shipments that break the rules. What Johnson is really demanding when he says there can be no “backstop” is that Brussels turns a blind eye while the UK punches a hole in the EU single market – a portal for smugglers and fraudsters. The answer was no when May tried this in 2018. It is still no today. If some other country had tried this while Britain was still an active EU member with a rational grasp of how the single market works, London would have led the chorus of no. It is hard to know how serious Johnson is about a deal because his tone is stuck in the parochial idiom of Tory Europhobia. He is trapped in the habit of using “Europe” and “Brussels” as rhetorical devices to mean foreign beasts that prey on sovereignty. Only when he is in the room with continental leaders does he remember that those words refer to powerful multinational institutions that require serious engagement. The insular habit leads many Tory MPs to ascribe no value to the first 24 months of Brexit negotiations. In hardline Eurosceptic mythology, the original article 50 period was a forgettable interregnum between the referendum and the appointment of a properly Eurosceptic prime minister. May’s work is covered in mucky remainer fingerprints, and is thus disposable. But for the EU, May’s tenure covered a serious intergovernmental process. It consumed precious time, energy and political capital. It yielded legal agreements, at least one of which – the 2017 “joint report” setting parameters for the Northern Irish backstop – was signed when Johnson was foreign secretary. He now pretends those texts are obsolete, which is a viable position for electioneering but a dead end in terms of Britain’s future relationship with Europe. There is no reason why Merkel or Macron should fashion a deal to the specifications of a Tory campaign. While Downing Street is thinking about clap lines for a speech, the EU wants legal guarantees that can withstand future changes in the political weather. The two sides are not operating to the same time horizon. Both say they want a deal, but Johnson means a headline to get through the week; Brussels means a treaty to secure the integrity of the European project for a generation. That misalignment of perspectives has plagued the Brexit process. Eurosceptics constantly underestimate EU states’ readiness to prize collective solidarity over relations with a splitter nation on its way out of the club. It never occurred to them, for example, that an Irish voice could carry further across the continent than an English one. They did not anticipate the difference between a European negotiation among member states (the kind where Britain often got its way) and a negotiation between the EU and an exiting country issuing unrealistic demands backed by improbable threats. Johnson still has not grasped that shift in the balance of power. He is committed to the fiction that Britain stands equal in global stature to the EU, and wedded to an electoral strategy that treats cooperation as cowardice. The Tories might gain some domestic advantage by ramping up the bellicose rhetoric. The prime minister can scoop the same old cards back up from the table and repeat the same bluffs, hoping to win a new stack of votes. But that weird poker system doesn’t work in Brussels. Johnson never took Brexit seriously enough to begin with. He still doesn’t understand that for the EU, this isn’t a game. • Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist
61	Jeremy Corbyn will never step aside to allow an alternative candidate to lead a caretaker government because “the rules are the rules”, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has said. Opposition leaders have held a series of meetings in recent weeks to discuss how to prevent a no-deal Brexit – and have not ruled out a vote of no confidence in the government if Boris Johnson tries to force through a no-deal departure on 31 October. If Johnson loses, some MPs believe an alternative government could be formed, to extend article 50, and perhaps to trigger an EU referendum before calling a general election. The Liberal Democrats leader, Jo Swinson, has suggested Corbyn would be unlikely to secure the necessary cross-party support and should step aside in favour of a less contentious candidate. Several other names have been mooted, including the former foreign secretary Margaret Beckett and the veteran Conservative Ken Clarke, who has had the whip removed for voting against the government. But Labour rejects that idea, believing that, as leader of the opposition, Corbyn is the clear alternative prime minister. Asked if someone other than Corbyn could lead such a government, McDonnell said: “No, the rules are the rules”. He suggested Swinson might change her mind, adding: “I’m a great believer in the powers of conversion.” A senior Labour source said: “People who want a government of national unity are playing fantasy football teams. It’s absolute, complete nonsense. Not only would no such thing ever be agreed, but the idea that such a government could exist for six months with no mandate is pure, utter nonsense.” Instead, Labour is determined to push for a general election as soon as a no-deal Brexit has been averted. Several Labour MPs at Monday night’s meeting of the parliamentary Labour party told Corbyn they would prefer a referendum to be held before a general election. That argument has previously been made by the deputy leader, Tom Watson, and the idea of attaching a “confirmatory” referendum to any Brexit deal the prime minister secures from the EU27 is again being discussed. But the Labour leader has repeatedly rejected that idea. Opposition MPs and Conservative rebels banded together last month to pass the Benn Act, aimed at forcing Johnson to request a Brexit delay if he fails to pass a deal by 19 October. But the MPs have widely differing views about how that extension should be used – with some hoping Brexit can be reversed, and others that the time could be used to negotiate a deal. Instead, Labour has mooted the idea that Corbyn could lead a caretaker government for a matter of days: just long enough to request an extension to article 50 and call a general election. The SNP leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, has repeatedly made clear that his party could support that idea. Asked whether Swinson could change her mind and support a Corbyn-led government, a Lib Dem spokesman said: “Jo is a great believer in the power of mathematics. Jeremy Corbyn does not have the numbers and needs to make clear who he would support if we need an emergency government.” Corbyn stamped his authority on Labour’s Brexit policy at last week’s party conference in Brighton, persuading delegates to back his chosen course of fighting a general election, without picking in advance which side Labour would take in a future referendum. With the Conservatives poised to campaign on the slogan “Get Brexit done”, Corbyn’s allies are concerned that becoming a remain party would jeopardise votes in leave-supporting constituencies. But several key shadow ministers, including Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry, have made clear they want the party to adopt a remain position. Thornberry was dropped as Corbyn’s regular stand-in for prime minister’s questions (PMQs) after criticising the party’s message in May’s European elections. With Johnson due to deliver his party conference speech in Manchester at the same time as PMQs on Wednesday, Dominic Raab will appear for the government – and Corbyn will be represented by the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott.
62	Colombia’s intelligence chief has resigned over a discredited dossier which supposedly proved that Venezuelan authorities were sheltering Colombian rebels, amid an escalating information war between the two neighbouring countries. The Colombian president, Iván Duque, brandished the file at the United Nations general assembly in New York last week, claiming that it was “conclusive proof” that Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, was harbouring Colombian guerrillas. Ample evidence has emerged to support Colombia’s concerns; the presence of fighters from the National Liberation Army (ELN) has been reported hundreds of miles across the border, and the group is believed to be responsible for a string of massacres in rural Venezuela last October. But it soon emerged that Duque’s dossier included years-old, uncredited press photos, which were actually taken in Colombia – not in Venezuela. Colombian officials dismissed the issue as a simple failure to credit sources, but late on Monday, the armed forces’ intelligence chief, Gen Oswaldo Peña, resigned. In a letter to Duque, Peña claimed he was resigning for personal reasons, though made mention of the scandal. “As a general of the republic, I am conscious of the need to take responsibility for my actions and those of my subalterns, so am acting accordingly,” he wrote. Diplomatic relations between Colombia and Venezuela have grown increasingly strained since Bogotá backed Juan Guaidó, the Venezuelan opposition leader who has become the figurehead of opposition to Maduro. Chief among Colombia’s criticisms of the Venezuelan president are accusations that he has sheltered Colombian leftist militias including the ELN and the now-demobilised Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (or Farc). Farc signed a peace deal with the Colombian government in 2016, but when two dissident rebel leaders announced in August that they were returning to war, Colombian officials claimed they were already in Venezuela. However, analysts say Colombia is shooting itself in the foot with its repeated blunders, especially after photographs emerged last month of Guaidó posing with rightwing Colombian paramilitaries while crossing the border in February. “It sure seems like, through sheer carelessness, the Colombian government keeps handing undeserved propaganda victories to the Maduro regime,” said Adam Isacson, a security analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, a thinktank. “US, Colombian and Venezuelan non-governmental organizations and media outlets have already produced credible reports of Venezuelan cooperation with Colombian guerrilla groups,” Isacson went on to say. “The Duque government’s sloppiness is undercutting that narrative.” Maduro’s government also used its appearance at the UN to weaponize false information. Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez presented coordinates for what she described as camps inside Colombia where “terrorists” were plotting against Venezuela. But the local website Colombia Reports found that two of the coordinates were locations in the Caribbean sea, while the third appeared to be the front yard of a house in the Colombian city of Maicao.
63	In a world where an orange supervillain is menacing democracy, a small group of progressive congresswomen of colour have been valiantly fighting to bring him down. Now the same US Congress that brought you the Squad has spawned a new Democratic girl gang. This one consists of five white congresswomen who call themselves the Badasses. The women reportedly adopted the name because they all used to be in the military or the CIA. (Nothing screams badass like signing up to an institution that is notorious for waterboarding people.) There has been little about the Badasses in the news because, until recently, the centrist lawmakers didn’t do anything particularly newsworthy. That changed last Monday when, along with two other moderate Democrats, they published an opinion piece in the Washington Post calling for Donald Trump to be impeached over allegations he pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the former vice-president Joe Biden. Less than 24 hours after the piece was published, Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry. There are numerous reasons that the inquiry has finally been ordered but, according to CNN, it was the Badasses wot won it. On Saturday, CNN published a glowing profile of the women, calling them “leaders on impeachment” and declaring that their article “changed the dynamic for House Democrats, and indeed the course of history”. Excuse me? I think the entity changing the course of history here is CNN. And by “changing” I mean “shamelessly whitewashing”. I don’t know what kind of fantasy world you have to be living in to call the Badasses “leaders on impeachment” when it took them until last week to decide Trump should face consequences for his actions. The real leaders here are the brown and black politicians who have spent years demanding impeachment. In May 2017, Al Green became the first congressional Democrat to call for impeachment, citing obstruction of justice, after Trump fired the FBI director James Comey. At that time, few Democrats backed the idea, but Green kept pushing, slowly gathering support. Maxine Waters, another black member of Congress, has also been tirelessly calling for Trump to face real consequences. In March she lamented that many of her colleagues “whisper the president should be impeached, but have not supported my call for impeachment. Only a few of us dare to continue to urge both Dems and Repubs to impeach this dangerous president.” Among the few who dared to publicly support Waters were members of the Squad. Indeed, the moment Rashida Tlaib was sworn into Congress she announced: “We’re gonna impeach the motherfucker!” She got a lot of flak for that “uncivil” comment. Remember: it’s fine for the US president to boast about grabbing women “by the pussy” (that’s locker-room talk!), but when other people use foul language it crosses a line. It may be true that it didn’t become politically expedient to call for impeachment until this Ukraine scandal. However, I highly doubt that Pelosi would have issued the order had it not been for a small number of brave politicians ensuring impeachment was a constant topic of conversation. As Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on Saturday, Waters and Tlaib “endured the brunt of gaslighting and vitriol for being among the first to recognise [White House] corruption and publicly advocate for impeachment, making it easier for the rest of us. People think that’s easy. It’s not.” Ocasio-Cortez is right. Standing up for your principles and calling for the most powerful man in the world to be impeached when your own party doesn’t support those calls isn’t easy. What is easy is standing by as others get abused for advocating impeachment and then, once the idea has been mainstreamed, jumping on the bandwagon. And there’s nothing badass about that.
64	Describing the chancellor’s speech as “hyperbole that crumbles under scrutiny” is a kind way of making clear that it was nothing more than a cynical jumble of half-baked, half-true assertions (This party split the country. A cash splurge can’t repair it, 1 October). We’ve grown used to – but shouldn’t accept – duplicity and hyperbole. Examples of misdirected but eye-catching spending include how the problems associated with social care, of quality, availability and cost, will not disappear as a result of a hospital-building programme. Communities cut off by swingeing cuts to public transport as a consequence of reductions in local authority funding that once used to subsidise such routes will not benefit from plans to upgrade roads – or the introduction of contactless payments on buses that don’t run. Of course low-paid workers will benefit from significant increases in the national minimum wage, but such gains will disappear under the weight of fast-rising food and fuel bills as quickly as they emerged. Les Bright Exeter, Devon • Re your report (Javid takes aim at Labour marginal with target of £10.50 national living wage, 1 October), the figure announced by Sajid Javid represents a rise of just 5% a year over five years. Worth a damp squib, not fanfare, when the Office for National Statistics says national wage inflation is 4%. Ritual moans from the Institute of Directors and British Chamber of Commerce should be read in the context of the tiny difference between these percentages. Alison Whitehouse London • In the post-election budget of 8 July 2015, George Osborne announced, for workers aged 25 and over, “a new national living wage. We will set it to reach £9 an hour by 2020.” The current figure is £8.21 and the Low Pay Commission “forecast” a rate of £8.67 for April 2020. The £9 figure has been quietly buried. Why should we believe the £10.50 target for 2024 announced by Sajid Javid? In August, the Low Pay Commission recommended that in April 2021 the age for the national living wage be lowered from 25 to 23 (with a subsequent reduction to 21). Javid is now taking the credit for this. Dr Dave Lyddon Keele University • Will the Tories abolish high wages too? Sylvia Ackling High Kelling, Norfolk • Contrary to the view of the head of shows at the Three Counties Showground (Three tonnes of goods donated to food bank, 30 September), this is not “getting back to the real meaning of harvest”. The Christian understanding is encapsulated in the hymn couplet “for a just and equal sharing, of the things that earth affords”. Our local churches support our food bank, but while the demand for family parcels has nearly doubled in 12 months we cannot keep up with the need. The Labour party aims to eradicate the need for food banks within three years by ensuring a fairer share of our country’s wealth. That is a proper expression of harvest. Rev David Haslam Evesham, Worcestershire • You rightly state in your leader (1 October) that universal credit is a “stain on the Conservatives”. In fact it is a cynical and manipulative misnomer, being neither universal nor giving much by way of credit to its many victims. For a benefit to be universal it must by definition apply to all, as in purportedly universal healthcare or education. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has proposed pilot schemes for universal basic income (UBI) and put forward plans for universal provision of basic services (UBS) including housing, transport, health and education. In his report for McDonnell on UBI and in his books Basic Income and How We Can Make it Happen and Plunder of the Commons, A Manifesto for Sharing Public Wealth, the economist Guy Standing makes a creditable and credible case for the very real benefits that society could accrue from universal provisions. To Labour’s credit, the search for more equitable universalist solutions shows more vision for the good of society than all the Conservative attempts to whitewash the iniquities of universal credit.

65	No one apart from the two people involved know whether Boris Johnson groped a young journalist (Ministers defend PM on groping allegations, 1 October). But the immediate backing of the PM’s denials by senior ministers is worrying. When the chancellor, the culture secretary and the chair of the party immediately state they “don’t doubt what he has said for a second” and “there is no truth in these allegations”, on what grounds have they made this judgment? Surely it cannot merely be on the word of a serial liar? Johnson is well known to have lied about past sexual misdemeanours. On important national issues such as whether many millions of Turkish immigrants will be allowed into the country without checks or if the police have been guilty of wastefully “spaffing money against the wall” investigating child abuse allegations, he has denied on camera saying such things although there is incontrovertible filmed evidence of him doing exactly that. So for senior ministers to state his denial is proof that something never happened does not inspire faith in their ability to make reasoned and balanced judgments. Dr Chris Morris Kidderminster, Worcestershire • That Toby Young can state that “people complained if Boris didn’t put his hand on their knee. Times really have changed” shows utter contempt for the women who were his colleagues. Thank goodness times have changed but shame on him that he hasn’t. Ann Lynch Skipton, North Yorkshire • You tell us Rachel Maclean, a Tory MP, says Boris is a feminist (Prime minister forced into denial of claims that he groped two women, 30 September). But you have never reported what plans he has to overthrow the patriarchy! Please find out. Is he going to introduce non-sexist primary schools? Universal, all-hours, free childcare – even for children with extra needs? Increase child benefit to a level at which mothers can feed their children well? Force all employers to have a 50:50 ratio of women and men in every job – especially in parliament? Actually enforce the Equal Pay Act? Henrietta Cubitt Cambridge • Much as I agree with the content of Polly Toynbee’s article (This party split the country. A cash splurge can’t repair it, 1 October), I was shocked to see her imitating Johnson’s crude language in “spaffing some last-minute cash”. When he first used it in describing spending money on investing child sexual abuse (“spaffing money against the wall”), I had to look up the word. It means “ejaculating”. That Toynbee should now be using this revolting term is worrying.

66	A Whitehall official who ran the scheme that granted Jennifer Arcuri a coveted entrepreneur visa had worked for Boris Johnson when he was mayor, the Guardian has learned. The US businesswoman, who is at the centre of a conflict of interest row over her friendship with the prime minister, beat nearly 2,000 applicants to gain one of 200 sought-after tier 1 entrepreneur visas on the government’s Sirius programme after Johnson helped promote her firm, Innotech, by giving keynote speeches at her events. The Guardian has learned that Paola Cuneo, the then director of the Sirius programme, previously spent two-and-a-half years working in a senior post at London &amp; Partners (L&amp;P), the official mayoral promotional agency which Johnson had responsibility for while he was in City Hall. Cuneo, Arcuri and Johnson attended the same Innotech event in October 2013, two months before the company joined the Sirius scheme. A whistleblower told the Guardian: “Innotech stood out compared to other startups in the programme, which had a much higher potential to scale up … I could not understand why we were giving so much attention and extra funds to Innotech.” Ten days after the news of Johnson’s relationship with Arcuri broke, the new disclosures will intensify speculation over a possible conflict of interest and raise fresh questions for the prime minister over whether he played an improper role in securing government support for his friend. Johnson has insisted that “everything was done with full propriety” but repeatedly refused to go into detail on what help, if any, he gave to Arcuri. On Tuesday, Johnson refused three times to deny outright that he had an affair with Arcuri in an interview with Sky News. When pressed on whether he was denying an affair, he said: “The crucial thing is that in terms of promoting London, everything was done with complete propriety.” The latest twist follows revelations that firms run by the entrepreneur – who is said to have confided in friends she was having an affair with Johnson – received £126,000 of public money. About £11,500 of that figure was paid by L&amp;P to Innotech while Johnson was mayor and after Cuneo left the agency. Arcuri also went on three overseas trade missions led by Johnson, two of which she had initially been turned down for. The Sirius scheme, run by UK Trade and Investment (now the Department for International Trade), aimed to attract international entrepreneurs to set up businesses in Britain by providing visas, expert advice and mentorship, as well as a £12,000 grant. According to evidence provided to the Guardian by a whistleblower, staff working on the Sirius programme warned Cuneo and other senior civil servants of a conflict of interest in June 2014 after Innotech was given £10,000 by the scheme to run a launch event for the programme the month before before without any tendering process. Staff were concerned that the programme team failed to follow procurement rules and warned there was a conflict of interest with the Sirius scheme paying the startup because it was already a recipient of the visa scheme. Speaking this week, the whistleblower accused Cuneo of showing favouritism towards Innotech and questioned the company’s suitability for a place on the programme given it was simply an events firm rather than developing a product. The whistleblower, who worked on the Sirius scheme at the time, told the Guardian: “I regarded the two decisions about Innotech [on the visa and the subsequent launch event contract] as examples of favouritism.” Innotech was the only company admitted in the first wave of Sirius startups that did not have a tech product, the whistleblower said. “It was fundamentally an event company. In that sense, Innotech stood out compared to other startups in the programme, which had a much higher potential to scale up. Potential to scale was one of the criteria we adopted to evaluate applicants. “This is significant because admission to the Sirius programme involved a tier 1 entrepreneur visa, plus a grant of £12,000, plus additional support resources.” The whistleblower said that after Innotech was admitted, Cuneo decided to give the firm an extra £10,000 to organise a launch event for the Sirius programme. “Several members of the team raised concerns about that decision, because it seemed not to follow standard procurement rules and because there was a clear conflict of interest (as we had already funded this startup). There were concerns because those services were procured without opening up the tender to competition and because the invoicing seemed to be irregular. On top of that, we already had a supplier for event management, so this seemed like a duplication.” Cuneo was the director of the Sirius programme from May 2013 until August 2016, boasting on Linkedin that she “designed, launched and ran the programme from its inception including business cases approval, suppliers and stakeholders management, team leadership”. The profile describes her role on the programme judging panel “reviewing a number of global applications for their assessment against key criteria as part of the panel of judges”. Prior to that, she served as head of L&amp;P for Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia and Pacific from 2009-11 while Johnson was mayor in City Hall where he served from 2008-16. Cuneo attended at least two Innotech events in 2014, including one at the House of Commons. In an Innotech promotional video recorded after she spoke at a joint Sirius/Innotech event, she said: “I think today was amazing, so inspiring. It was great to have representation from the VC world, the corporate world, the startups, the accelerators. “We’ve gone out of our way all over the world [to] select the best talents and we put them into the UK, which as we’ve heard today is a pretty amazing place to be an entrepreneur.” She also sent a number of supportive tweets about Arcuri, writing to her in October 2015 saying: “You nailed it.” More recently, in 2016, Cuneo wrote that she was “very proud” of Arcuri. The whistleblower added: “Before leading the Sirius programme, Cuneo was holding a senior position at London &amp; Partners. At that time, I could not understand why we were giving so much attention and extra funds to Innotech – in light of the news that has been published last week, I started to make a possible connection. That is why I came out with this information, which I believe to be of public interest.” The Department for International Trade declined to comment. Arcuri and Cuneo did not respond to requests for comment.
67	Grace Blakeley makes a compelling case for reform of capitalism (No alternative to capitalism? Now workers can take control, 30 September). But I hope she sees that national assets cannot just be transferred to state, worker and community ownership. This overlooks the other indispensable ingredients if our collective bid to move from casino capitalism to a sustainable social market economy is to be realised. As so often is the case there is regrettably little attention paid to the great achievements within the European Union in promoting better and more effective governance at every level, an inclusive corporate culture and capital markets that support long-term development. This lies at the heart of the significant social, political and economic achievements of the Rhineland economies when compared with British and American socioeconomic outturns. We need to look beyond Britain and the US – blighted as both countries are – in our search for practical tried and tested ways of moving things forward. But most of all we need to see this as a long-term transformation in the culture of ownership and control. There is no simple on/off switch that will allow us to get rid of the champions of neoliberal capitalism and replace them with well-intentioned workers and other public figures. The transformation demands fundamental cultural change at many levels in our society and the political will to bring this about. Richard Tudway Burgess Hill, West Sussex • Grace Blakeley tells us that since 2008 we’ve had “huge increases in inequality”. The version of the Office for National Statistics data available online says that the Gini Index, the usual measure of income inequality, has declined from 34.1 in 2006-07 to 32.5 in the 2018-19 financial year.

68	We must thank Philip Boehm and Penguin for the new translation of Arthur Koestler’s Darkness at Noon (Report, 25 September). We should also thank Michael Scammell for his thoughtful and incisive introduction. Equally, it seems, we are indebted to them for revealing that the 1940 translation by Daphne Hardy (my mother) was in several respects inaccurate, due to her inexperience and to the difficult conditions under which she worked. Three generations of readers, along with many eminent critics over the years, appear to have laboured under the misapprehension that they were reading a masterpiece of 20th-century literature. It is pointed out that Hardy mistranslated a few official terms, such as putting “hearing” for “interrogation”, incongruities that were no doubt glossed over previously. Those not versed in the brutal history of the Soviet regime might, it is suggested, have been misled by such inadvertent softening, as to the way in which due legal process was brushed aside by Stalin, most blatantly during the show trials, Rubashov’s “Punch and Judy show”. But we are left in no doubt about the brutality of the regime. From December 1940 Koestler made this country his home and from then on only wrote in English. Yet he never saw fit to revise Hardy’s translation, which was reprinted by Penguin year after year and was included in a new hardback edition of his collected works in the 1960s. Koestler’s English was good and he would, I believe, have checked every word Daphne wrote. The book mattered to him more than anything else he ever wrote and he would have made sure that what was published contained only what he wanted to say. Incidentally, Hardy attended a German school in Holland where she was taught by nuns, in German, hence she was very fluent in the language, as well as in Dutch and French.

69	The American soprano Jessye Norman, who has died of complications from a spinal cord injury aged 74, was one of the most prominent singers of the last quarter of the 20th century. At her peak, her opulent tone, combined with a regal stage manner, brought her immense prestige and high fees. Though generally billed as a soprano, or “dramatic soprano”, she had a gloriously rich middle and lower register, which she exploited to great effect in repertoire associated with mezzo-sopranos. Her voice type, combining the tessitura of a dramatic or spinto soprano with the timbre of a mezzo, was sometimes referred to as that of a “falcon”, named after the famous 19th-century French singer Cornélie Falcon. Norman’s 1983 recording of Richard Strauss’s Four Last Songs with Kurt Masur became a desert island choice for many. Certainly it maximises the voluptuous quality of her voice cresting the waves of the orchestra in full flood. The rapturous upward soaring of the soul in Beim Schlafengehen never fails to thrill and if Masur’s turgid tempi, especially in Im Abendrot, are questionable, they nevertheless serve to demonstrate Norman’s exemplary breath control. An amusing reference to the recording occurs in the play Peter Gynt, David Hare’s recent Ibsen update, where the hero’s mother, compiling the playlist for her funeral, considers but rejects Norman’s version of the Four Last Songs as being “too sentimental”.Growing up in Augusta, Georgia, Norman was aware from a very early age of the misery and injustice generated by segregation. Her memoir Stand Up Straight and Sing!, published in 2014, was written, she said, to tell the story of “African-American families in the Jim Crow South” who wanted to have “their worth in the world” acknowledged. The book also deals with the civil rights movement and the inspiration she took from Marian Anderson, the first black singer to appear at the Metropolitan Opera, New York, in 1955. Indeed, many of her earliest successes were in Europe. Having won the Munich International music competition in 1968, she made her operatic debut the following year at the Deutsche Oper, Berlin, as Elisabeth in Tannhäuser, later appearing there as Countess Almaviva in the Marriage of Figaro. Further engagements in Europe included Aida at La Scala and her Covent Garden debut as Cassandra in Berlioz’s Les Troyens, both in 1972. Her US stage debut did not come until 1982, when she sang Jocasta in Stravinsky’s Oedipus Rex and Purcell’s Dido with the Opera Company of Philadelphia. Her Metropolitan debut, once again as Cassandra, was the following year. Other roles in which she excelled included Wagner’s Sieglinde and Kundry, Strauss’s Ariadne, The Woman in Schoenberg’s Erwartung, Judith in Bartók’s Bluebeard’s Castle, Madame Lidoine in Poulenc’s Dialogues des Carmélites, Beethoven’s Leonore and Weber’s Euryanthe. As a lieder singer she was able to unfold seamless legato lines while bringing a powerful sense of drama to bear. In Schubert’s Erlkönig, for example, her characterisation of the concerned father, the terrified son and the sinister Erl King is positively operatic in quality – as is the delivery of the final words “war tot” (was dead). In Ravel’s Chansons Madécasses, the graphic representation of brutal colonialism in Aoua! (“beware the white man”) was evidently close to her heart. Other song repertory in which she made her mark included that of Mahler, Brahms (her mezzo timbre was ideal for the Two Songs for alto, viola and piano, Op 91), Berlioz (Les Nuits d’été), Poulenc, Schumann, Strauss, Wolf and Schoenberg. From the 1990s Norman was increasingly involved in crossover and other popular forms of music-making. A Carnegie Hall recital in the 1998-99 season incorporated sacred music by Duke Ellington, scored for jazz combo, string quartet and piano. A television special was filmed during the same season in her home town of Augusta. In 2000 she released the jazz crossover album I Was Born in Love With You, featuring songs by Michel Legrand. She also threw her energies into educational and outreach projects, establishing the Jessye Norman School of the Arts in Georgia to provide free tuition for disadvantaged children. Jessye was one of five children born into a musical family: her mother, Janie King-Norman, was a teacher and amateur pianist, while her father, Silas Norman, an insurance broker, sang in an amateur choir. A particular item of furniture ensconced in a corner of the front room of her maternal grandparents’ house intrigued her: a harmonium. She later recalled it as “the most exotic thing I had ever encountered in my entire life”. She started piano lessons early and displayed vocal talent too, singing gospel songs in a local church at the age of four. A ninth birthday present of a radio introduced her to the world of opera in the form of the weekly broadcasts from the Metropolitan. Inspired by the examples of Anderson and Leontyne Price she embarked on an opera performance programme in northern Michigan. She also studied at Howard University (Washington DC), the Peabody Conservatory (Baltimore) and the University of Michigan (with, among others, Pierre Bernac and Elizabeth Mannion). Prior to her stage debut in the US, she appeared in the title role of Aida in a 1972 concert performance at the Hollywood Bowl. An all-Wagner concert followed at Tanglewood and then a national recital tour before an appearance in the Great Performers series in Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center (1973). Later that decade she became a well-known figure on the recital and concert circuit, with appearances at the Edinburgh and Salzburg festivals and elsewhere throughout Europe. By the mid-80s she was sufficiently prominent to be invited to sing at the second inauguration of Ronald Reagan. She accepted with some misgivings, on account of her political beliefs. In 1989 she appeared with Zubin Mehta at the opening concert of the New York Philharmonic’s season, an event which PBS broadcast live on television. In 1994 she sang at the funeral of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Her appearance in the Metropolitan’s premiere production of Janáček’s The Makropulos Affair (1996) was highly acclaimed. In 1997 she appeared at the second inauguration of Bill Clinton and in 2001 sang America the Beautiful at a memorial service for the victims of the Twin Towers terrorist attacks. A documentary film was made in 1994 by André Heller about her life and work highlighting its social and political aspects. A protracted libel case was brought by Norman in the late 90s against the magazine Classic CD for alleging that, having been trapped in a swing door and advised to turn sideways, she had replied: “Honey, I ain’t got no sideways.” Norman suffered more ridicule as a result of the publicity than the offence perhaps warranted, but she claimed that she was particularly offended by the “patronising mockery of speech attributed to certain black Americans”. She lost the case. By the early years of the 21st century her timbre was beginning to lose its lustre, but she retained the imperious mien that had always characterised her stage presence: a simple arm movement or a raised eyebrow was enough to command attention. She retained too the commitment to unfamiliar and contemporary repertoire, giving the first performance of Judith Weir’s Woman.Life.Song (2000) at Carnegie Hall (subsequently repeated in London). At Norman’s instigation the chosen texts were by Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison and Clarissa Pinkola Estés. In 2009 she curated a celebration of the African-American cultural legacy under the title Honor! Included were African-American trailblazers in various fields; among the notable New York venues were Carnegie Hall and the Cathedral of St John the Divine. Her support for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama led to the suggestion that she might stand for office herself. Asked about the possibility of her running for Congress, she replied: “I considered it and then I put it aside. I don’t think that I would be successful because I would not be able to hold back on what I need to say.” Among the boards on which she served latterly were those of Citymeals on Wheels in New York City and the Elton John Aids Foundation; she also supported the SLE Lupus Foundation and Partnership for the Homeless. She is survived by two of her siblings, James and Elaine. • Jessye Norman, operatic soprano, born 15 September 1945; died 30 September 2019
70	Boris Johnson is overseeing a political strategy similar to Donald Trump, the former Tory minister David Gauke has said, as he warned the Conservatives not to descend down a path of populism. The former justice secretary, who lost the whip after voting to stop a no-deal Brexit, voiced his frustration with the prime minister’s strategy, which he said was “Trumpian” in terms of the type of language being used and the overall tone of debate. A divisive Downing Street, briefings using the phrase “collaborator” and riling up party activists all belong to a strategy that “corresponds more to Trump than to the long tradition of the Conservatives and Winston Churchill”, he told the Guardian. Gauke is no longer able to stand as a Conservative MP, alongside 20 other rebels who were kicked out of the parliamentary Tory party for voting for the Benn Act, which stops a no-deal Brexit and compels Johnson to extend article 50 if he cannot strike a deal, and to pass it through parliament by 19 October. Several members of the group, including the former chancellor Philip Hammond, are being investigated by Downing Street, which alleges they worked with foreign powers to draft the legislation. Gauke said the announcement of that investigation, which featured on the front page of the Mail on Sunday, was full of “Trumpian overtones” – primarily “because it’s not true”. Those overtones included “the sense that anybody who disagrees is unpatriotic and betrays the country”, he said. “The attacks on the judiciary are views more in the tradition of Trump and it’s not something Margaret Thatcher would do. She was a radical prime minister but she was a great defender of our national institutions.” Gauke hopes to stand again for South West Hertfordshire, but will have to do so as an independent. Comparing Johnson and Trump, he said: “They are very different personalities but in terms of political strategy, because of what we see from No 10 is divisive and exercising the base and that is very similar to Donald Trump.” Despite their expulsion from the party, many of the Tory rebels attended this week’s conference. At various fringe events, Gauke has hammered home the same warning to his party. On Sunday night, he said the party was no longer that of Churchill, but “more the party of Trump”. In an interview with the Guardian, he said: “What is not clear at the moment is if the Conservative party has changed in terms of its appeal and the voters it’s looking to attract and whether this is temporary because of the stresses and strains of Brexit, or whether there’s more permanent realignment of British politics in the way that the Republican party in the US has changed its appeal and its coalition of voters.” He continued: “I believe that the Conservative party is at its best when it’s a pro-business, pragmatic party, so to appeal to the country, and the country loses out significantly if the centre right of politics becomes much more populist, nationalist, and more right of centre. “It is Trumpian in tone and language. And some of the political strategy corresponds more to Trump then to the long tradition of the Conservative party and Churchill.” There had been expectations from those close to the rebels that any of their appearances at party conference could attract hecklers and negative comments from party members. “The response I’ve had and the behaviour of Conservative members has been courteous, polite, generous,” he said. “There are many who strongly disagree with the steps that I have taken, some of the things I’ve said, but what is striking is Conservative members want the party to be a broad church.”
71	Sayeeda Warsi is wrong to say the Policy Exchange fringe meeting at Tory party conference was a “Muslim-bashing fest” (The Tories do not care about Islamophobia, Journal, 1 October). I was a panellist and can confirm that not a single speaker attacked the Muslim community; though some did critique Islamist extremism. Every speaker, including two Muslim women, condemned anti-Muslim prejudice. Two of us questioned parliament’s sweeping definition of Islamophobia as a potential threat to free speech. That’s all. Being named “Islamophobe of the Year” was joked about because it was awarded by what I regard as an Islamist group that opposes human rights and supports the tyrannical Iranian regime. Hence my sarcastic joke. I criticised Tory anti-Muslim prejudice, urged an inquiry into it, defended Muslim communities and made concrete proposals to protect Muslims against discrimination and hate crime.

72	I read Richard Williams’ piece on the world athletics championships with interest (IAAF sellout Qatar’s empty seats tell tale of corruption, warped priorities and vested interests, 1 October), but choked on this: “But then one remembers that two years after the lights go out in Doha the next IAAF world championships will take place in Eugene, Oregon, notable in terms of world athletics only for being the town where Nike was founded and has its world headquarters.” Mr Williams may well be right to infer Nike’s influence behind the choice of Eugene as a venue, but to suggest it is not “notable in terms of world athletics” is highly questionable. Nike was not founded in Eugene by chance: it was founded there to make shoes for track and field athletes, notably those at the University of Oregon, where one of its co-founders was the track coach. That school is a noted powerhouse in track and field. Eugene brands itself variously as “Tracktown USA” (there is a giant sign to this effect) and “the Track and Field Capital of the World”. It has hosted the US national championships eight times and the US Olympic trials six times, and will host the trials again next year. It also hosts the Prefontaine Classic, a Diamond League event, every year. The athletics history of the town, the university and Nike are intertwined such that the influence of each on the other is difficult to unpick, but I don’t think it’s right to suggest Eugene is not notable in its own right.

74	Dover could lose £1bn worth of trade a week if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, the port has said. Doug Bannister, the chief executive at the port of Dover, told a fringe event at the Conservative conference that the government’s assumed drop in traffic under a no-deal scenario would cut £1bn a week from the flow of goods. He said the port had made extensive preparations for 31 October to function as usual but added: “That’s how critical it is. If there’s a no-deal Brexit, it’s not going to be OK. But people are doing all they can to ensure Britain keeps trading.” The transport minister, George Freeman, confirmed the government’s “planning assumption” was that no-deal disruption would roughly halve the traffic – a fall of 40%-60% – able to pass through Britain’s main trading link for three months. Dover handles £122bn a year by value, or 17% of the UK’s trade in goods. A fleet of 12 ferries carries more lorries than all other UK ports combined, on the shortest sea crossing between the UK and the EU. Freeman said he hoped goodwill would prevail if a deal was not agreed by 31 October, averting worst case disruption. Asked what preparations the government was making for “malign interventions”, such as a potential blockade by French fishermen, Freeman said he had seen cabinet papers showing that “the ministry of defence are actively looking at it”. The Freight Transport Association(FTA) said it did not expect “wholesale meltdown” but British consumers could expect to see less fresh produce. James Hookham, the deputy chief executive of the FTA, said: “There will be changes to what people can expect to see in the shops, undoubtedly.” The FTA plan to hold 140 training sessions in the next few weeks to educate hauliers about the potential paperwork needed. Hookham said questions still remained unanswered, even with the intricate flowchart issued by the Department for Transport to explain customs and border processes. “The biggest unknown in our book is what the French and EU will demand in terms of British goods imported into the EU,” he said. Hookham added that the full impact of a no-deal Brexit on Dover, Calais and Kent would probably not be seen until 4 November, due to the public holiday on 1 November.
75	The Lionesses are set to break the attendance record for a women’s match in England with over 75,000 tickets sold for their game against Germany at Wembley on 9 November. The current record for a women’s match, 70,584, was set when Team GB beat Brazil at the 2012 Olympics. The Lionesses’ record attendance is currently 45,619, established when they beat Germany 3-0 at Wembley in 2014. In addition to the Wembley game, the FA have announced that over 30,000 tickets have been sold for Saturday’s friendly against Brazil at Middlesbrough’s Riverside Stadium, which has a capacity of 34,742. The squad then fly out to play Portugal on Tuesday night. Phil Neville’s side will be hoping to end a run of four games without a win which began with defeat to eventual champions the US in the World Cup semi-finals. After losing their third-place play-off game to Sweden, a Nikita Parris penalty salvaged a 3-3 draw against Belgium and they lost 2-1 in Norway. The interest in watching the Lionesses is mirrored domestically, with more than 100,000 attending the opening three rounds of the Women’s Super League, topping the approximately 92,000 that attended across the course of all 110 games last season. The record 31,213 crowd for Manchester City v Manchester United at the Etihad, 24,790 at the London Stadium on Sunday and 24,564 at Stamford Bridge, make up the bulk of that figure and show that the drive of the FA and clubs to build on the success of the Women’s World Cup and draw the interest into the domestic game is bearing fruit. Tickets for the game against Brazil can be purchased here:.
76	In entirely random, but nevertheless heartwarming news, two of Tottenham’s most famous faces, Adele and Skepta, are reportedly dating. The pair were recently spotted enjoying an evening out at the Crystal Maze Live Experience in London, where they locked eyes as Skepta alluringly filled small bowls with sand to release a crystal, and Adele roared, “Start the fans, please!” so loudly that the dome shattered into a thousand pieces … well, something like that, anyway. But is an immersive experience inspired by a 90s TV show really the ideal place for romance? Naturally, I went along – without a date – to find out. My first impression is that this may have been the hopeless place Rihanna was singing about: the experience is located in perhaps the least amorous part of London, Piccadilly Circus. There may be a statue of Eros in the street, but, on a Tuesday lunchtime at least, it’s 10% buskers, 90% Italian schoolchildren. Inside, though, it seems this could have date potential; no one in my eight-strong group (two of whom, curiously, have never seen the TV show) looks too bad in the trademark red bomber jacket. And, lo and behold, among the team there is a couple on a date: Chris and Eleni, who are celebrating Chris’s birthday. Getting into the challenges, however, the potential for romance quickly falters. No one looks dignified straddling a massive mechanical rocket while the mazemaster hurls innuendoes at them, not even Chris, who is wearing a black tracksuit and shiny new trainers for the occasion. The puzzle activities offer more time for bonding, although having your date fling abuse at you because you couldn’t decode Blood Diamond from emojis of a syringe and a gemstone would surely be a humiliating experience for anyone. In fact, a thread of low-level humiliation runs through the whole Crystal Maze Live Experience, not least when you (me) realise you can’t use a crossbow, do not actually know how a crossbow works and end up lobbing the darts across the room by hand, while your team sigh loudly. This is categorically not a first-date experience, so it makes sense that Adele and Skeppy go way back (in a 2016 interview, he said that Adele texted him “all the time and keeps me in check”) . In fact, anyone suggesting Crystal Maze Live Experience on a dating app – instead of £30 worth of “small plates” at a pub – is probably far too comfortable with life. But, as an activity for people who know each other well and want to know each other even better, why the hell not? Or, as Eleni succinctly puts it: “It was either this or couple’s bungee jumping.”
77	October 1 was meant to be a carefully choreographed showcase of China’s military and economic might on the 70th anniversary of communist rule, and a celebration of the strongman president, Xi Jinping. But after a picture-perfect parade was beamed around the world from Beijing, the one part of the country that is not under his full control ripped up the playbook, with the people of Hong Kong pouring on to the streets to challenge Xi’s vision for China. By mid-afternoon in Hong Kong an 18-year-old student had been shot point blank in the chest by a policeman, swathes of the city were engulfed in violent chaos and Beijing’s militaristic anniversary celebrations had been swept from international headlines. “This was meant to be such a celebration but it’s really a PR disaster,” said Louisa Lim, a senior lecturer at the University of Melbourne and author of The People’s Republic of Amnesia, a book about the 1989 protests against the Chinese government. She pointed out that as the streets of Hong Kong filled with teargas, water cannon and smoke and flames from the fires lit by protesters, senior leaders in Beijing were filing into a gala dinner. Among them was Carrie Lam, the chief executive of Hong Kong. “It makes China’s leaders look so heartless, watching violinists and fireworks and here the people of Hong Kong are demonstrating for their lives, and a kid is in hospital,” said Lim. “It really is a split screen.” Individually the teachers, logistics workers, retirees, students and others who came out to demonstrate have very little power beyond the right to protest; under Hong Kong law they cannot even choose their own leader in elections. But together they represent perhaps the biggest challenge yet to Xi, risking injury and arrest to denounce his “China dream” as a sham, expose the fragility of his claim to national unity, and fight for a different future. China’s approach to National Day celebrations in Beijing and Hong Kong underscored how hampered the leadership is in its approach to tackling a popular uprising. The party has years of practice at central planning, propaganda messaging and bruising political control, and almost no experience responding to popular pressure. That meant details of the triumphant parade through Beijing were so meticulously planned that residents along the route were forced to move out and guidelines painted on to the road to ensure each inch driven by Xi’s limousine would be in perfect formation. Yet faced with a surge of popular protest in Hong Kong, the Communist party appears helpless. Here the government can’t easily control messaging, use force to crush its opponents or the legal system to round them up, and officials seem unable or unwilling to come up with alternatives. “The problem is that their playbook isn’t really equipped for a population like Hong Kong’s, and yet still they keep going with it, even as the situation gets more acute,” Lim said. “It shows the limits of the strategy used towards Hong Kong. It seems the authorities believe brute force and intimidation would work, but if you look at the sheer numbers that came out today, even though the protests were not authorised, people are not intimidated.”
78	Finally, here’s our news story on the WTO’s warning of a trade slowdown. Stocks have fallen on both sides of the Atlantic after the closely-watched ISM survey of US factories hit its lowest level in a decade. Europe’s main indices all closed in the red, with the FTSE 100 down 47 points or 0.65% at 7,360. Fashion group Burberry (-3%), Royal Bank of Scotland (-2.9%) and mining giant Glencore (-2.7%) were all among the top fallers. France’s CAC shed 1.4%, while Germany’s DAX closed 1.3% lower. Wall Street is taking a bath too, with the Dow Jones industrial average down 259 points or almost 1%. Here’s the chart that has worried investors: The slowdown in world trade forecast by the WTO today shows that life after Brexit won’t be easy. Ursula Johnston, head of customs at law firm, Gowling WLG, explains: The recent WTO trade forecasts indicate a fairly significant slowdown in the rate of growth of global trade. The UK should consider that when outside the safety net of the EU single market and European customs union, peddling UK goods and services to the rest of the world will not be plain sailing. In particular the UK’s exposure to large scale trade conflicts will certainly begin to bite. Here’s Ana Nicholls, Industry Director at The Economist Intelligence Unit, in the no-deal Brexit threat to Nissan’s Sunderland car plant: Nissan will have no choice but to review its plans for Sunderland if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. Toyota and others will review their production plans too. About 80% of the Sunderland plant’s output is exported and a similar share of components are imported, mostly to and from the EU. The no-deal Brexit could well disrupt that supply chain; as well as complicating paperwork and logistics, it would also add tariffs of 10% for cars and 4.5% for parts. America’s factories are clearly suffering from the trade war, and the slowdown in the eurozone isn’t helping either. This looks bad - US factory activity had fallen at the fastest rate in a decade, accordingly to the ISM’s September health check. Its US manufacturing PMI has dropped to 47.8, further away from the 50-point mark separating growth from contraction. Time for a quick recap of the main points. The WTO has slashed its forecast for global trade, in the face of US-China tensions and Brexit. It now predicts goods trade will only rise by 1.2%, down from 3% last year. UK factories are slashing jobs at the fastest rate since early 2013, as the manufacturing slowdown continues. Output, new orders and exports all fell, but some factories are benefitting from a new bout of Brexit stock-piling. Europe’s factory sector is also struggling, with sharp output drops in Germany, Italy and Sweden last month. Uncertainty over Britain’s exit from the EU is also hitting the housing market. House prices fell by 0.2% in September, the Nationwide building society says, with sharp falls in and around London. High street bakers Greggs has revealed that its Brexit contingency plans (mentioned earlier) includes changing some of its recipes. Bloomberg has the details: If there are any disruptions at ports, “we’ll be able to last a few days and then hopefully it will settle down,” chief executive Roger Whiteside said on a call with reporters as the company reported a slowdown in sales growth that prompted a fall in the shares. “Should there be any short-term pressures on some ingredients then there are alternative recipe suggestions we can fall back to.” Greggs has already tried to reduce its dependency on European suppliers, sourcing more of its cheese and sugar from U.K.-based companies. It has also brought forward purchases of trucks from continental Europe to limit the effect of any delays at the borders on its own distribution network. “A lot of what we sell clearly has a level of substitution involved,” Whiteside said. “People won’t go without food. They’ll make different food choices dependent on what’s available.” Just in: A no-deal Brexit would increase the risk that Japanese carmaker Nissan closes its Sunderland car plant. The Financial Times is reporting that Nissan will review its decision to build the Qashqai sport utility vehicle at its Sunderland plant if Britain leaves the EU without a deal. If Sunderland lost the Qashqai contract, it could lead to the eventual closure of the site, the FT fears. Here’s a flavour of their story: The Japanese carmaker pledged in November 2016 to build the SUV in the UK, safeguarding thousands of jobs, after its then chairman Carlos Ghosn received assurances from the government that its operations would be protected from the impact of Brexit. But following last year’s ousting of Mr Ghosn and a collapse in profits, Nissan has undertaken a global review that makes everything including the Sunderland plant vulnerable to downsizing or closure. The carmaker’s decision to manufacture in the UK was contingent on a “soft” Brexit that includes a trade deal or transition arrangement, a decision that it would reassess if Britain leaves the EU without any deal, according to two people familiar with its original investment decision. Here’s a handy couple of charts showing how trade growth, and the expanding Chinese economy, have risen hand in hand. There’s a major shake-up under way at the John Lewis Partnership. One in three senior management HQ jobs are being cut, as it effectively merges the running of its supermarkets (Waitrose) and department stores (John Lewis). More here: Some good news: Belfast shipyard Harland and Wolff has been saved from closure, by a London-based energy firm. My colleague Rob Davies explains: The historic shipyard went into administration in August after its Norwegian parent company collapsed. But InfraStrata, which works on projects such as the Islandmagee underground gas storage plant off the coast of Country Antrim, said it planned to retain the 79 staff still employed at the yard and potentially employ hundreds more. The Unite union praised the company’s workers for fighting to keep it alive, including a nine-week sit-in protest that was designed to raise awareness about its plight. The WTO has also provided these charts, which show clearly that trade growth has levelled out since summer 2018 -- when Donald Trump imposed the first tranche of tariffs on China. Here are the key points from the WTO’s new trade forecasts, which are rather gloomier than three months ago: World merchandise trade volume is forecast to grow 1.2% in 2019. This is substantially below the 2.6% trade growth that had been projected in April. Trade volume growth should accelerate slightly to 2.7% in 2020 while global GDP growth holds steady at 2.3% (at market exchange rates), but this depends on an easing of trade tensions. Trade conflicts pose the biggest downside risk to the forecast but macroeconomic shocks and financial volatility are also potential triggers for a steeper downturn. Trade-related indicators signal a worrying trajectory for world trade based on global export orders and economic policy uncertainty. Export and import growth slowed across all regions and at all levels of development in the first half of 2019. The World Trade Organisation has slashed its forecast for global trade growth to its lowest in a decade, and Brexit is partly to blame. In a warning sign to businesses, and governments around the globe, the WTO predicted that global merchandise trade will only increase by 1.2% this year, compared with its April estimate of 2.6%. That would be a serious slowdown, as trade grew by 3.0% in 2018. It would also be the worst year since the financial crisis a decade ago. For 2020, the WTO has cut its forecast to 2.7% growth, from 3.0%. It also cautioned that these forecasts are laden with “downside risks” It cited the weakening global economy, the ongoing trade dispute between China and America, and Brexit-related uncertainty. WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo warned that: “The darkening outlook for trade is discouraging but not unexpected. Beyond their direct effects, trade conflicts heighten uncertainty, which is leading some businesses to delay the productivity-enhancing investments that are essential to raising living standards. Less trade means fewer jobs. As Azevêdo puts it: “Job creation may also be hampered as firms employ fewer workers to produce goods and services for export.” Brexit stockpiling might give factories a short-term boost, but it’s not very good for the economy as a whole. It means that firms are holding onto more raw materials than they’d like, tying up precious capital that could be used more productively elsewhere. It also distracts from longer-term planning. Lee Collinson, head of manufacturing at Barclays, explains: Some parts of the sector have started to build up inventories again as the 31st October Brexit deadline looms large. The knock-on effect is that this activity is diverting valuable funds away from much-needed investment projects. To make matters worse, a growing global economic slowdown is increasingly casting a shadow over the sector coupled with reports that some EU-based clients are moving supply chains away from the UK. There’s another problem with stockpiling - you literally have to put the stuff somewhere. Last week, Bloomberg’s Lucy Meakin spoke to a fruit crisp manufacturer who bought 24 tonnes (!) of beetroot ahead of the original Brexit deadline in March. That meant paying for expensive refrigerated storage, which they’d rather not do again. Stephen Cooper, Head of Industrial Manufacturing at KPMG UK, says today’s UK manufacturing PMI report is pretty bad. Firms should check they have enough working capital to ride out the slowdown, he warns, saying; “We expected grim news from this month’s UK Manufacturing PMI readings and that unfortunately came to fruition, albeit with marginal improvement on last month’s performance. “A backdrop of global trade wars, Brexit uncertainty and concerns regarding the slowing global economic growth continue to weigh heavily on the industry, with Europe, our leading trading partner, far from immune. Indeed Europe posted their worst performance since October 2012. “Lower orders for new work, job losses and reduced investment levels due to prolonged uncertainty paints a rather bleak set of conditions which are unlikely to abate any time soon. This reinforces the importance for manufacturers to ensure that their working capital and supply chains are as robust as possible to weather these challenging times.” Steve Harris of Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking says some UK factories are focused on short-term Brexit problems, rather than looking further ahead: “Short-term Brexit headwinds continue to dominate domestically, but it is clear that weaker international demand and trade wars globally are impacting on growth. The danger remains this causes manufacturers to hold back investment and become myopic losing sight of medium and long-term growth opportunities. Encouragingly, anecdotal feedback and our own research suggests this isn’t happening everywhere, but that doesn’t remove the fact resources are being applied to short-term planning to tackle the immediate challenges. More reaction: Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, fears that the UK manufacturing sector is sliding into recession. Here’s his take on today’s PMI report: Output, new orders and employment all fell further as rising political, trade and economic uncertainties exacerbated concerns about Brexit. “The rate of job losses accelerated to a six-and-a- half-year high, highlighting how manufacturers are increasingly seeking to cut costs. Similarly, the investment goods sector was especially hard hit in September, seeing the sharpest drops in production and new business, as clients reined in capital spending while conditions remained volatile. Newsflash: UK factories are cutting jobs at the fastest pace in six years, despite getting a boost from Brexit stockpiling. Data firm Markit reports that output shrank again last month, as the downturn at British manufacturing continues. Bosses reported that output, new orders, and new export business all fell further in September. Employment levels also declined, at the fastest pace since February 2013. Markit says: Companies reported that capacity had been reduced due to lower demand, efforts to control costs, redundancies and natural wastage. Job losses were widespread across the sector, with declines seen across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods industries and at SMEs and large-sized producers. Economic uncertainty, the weak European economy, and the trade war between Washington and Beijing all appear to be hurting the UK’s industrial base. But there are also signs that companies are preparing for the looming Brexit deadline. Stocks of purchases and input buying volumes also rose for the first time in recent months, as some companies restarted their preparations for Britain to leave the EU. This lifted the manufacturing PMI up to 48.3 in September, from August’s six-and-a-half year low of 47.4. The most remarkable story of the morning is that the chief operating officer of Credit Suisse has resigned, over a spying operation against the bank’s own outgoing head of wealth management. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: Switzerland’s second-biggest bank said Pierre-Olivier Bouée has stepped down after private detectives were hired to tail Iqbal Khan, the bank’s former head of wealth management. An investigation into the scandal by the Homburger law firm on behalf of the board cleared Tidjane Thiam, Credit Suisse’s chief executive, and found that Bouée alone was responsible for the botched surveillance of Khan, who left in July and later joined arch-rival UBS. The surveillance led to a confrontation in the streets of Zurich last month between Khan and the private detectives. The decision to put Khan under surveillance is quite astonishing, and obviously backfired when Khan spotted he was being spied on. CS may have worried that he could poach bankers and clients for UBS - where he starts work today! But even though Thaim has been cleared, the affair does raise questions about his leadership. He and Khan had what the FT calls an “acrimonious relationship”, due to a series of domestic rows over their adjoining properties in Zurich. One such spat apparently centred on some trees planted on the Thaim residence... Ouch! The slump in the eurozone’s manufacturing sector has deepened, hit by the US-China trade war and Brexit. Data firm Markit has reported that factory output and new orders both fell sharply again last month. This dragged its Eurozone Manufacturing PMI down to 45.7, from 47.0 in August and its lowest reading since October 2012. Anything below 50 shows contraction, and such a weak reading suggests the eurozone is weakening. Germany suffered particularly badly, with the weakest PMI in 123 months. Italy, Spain and Austria also suffered contractions. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit said: “The health of the eurozone manufacturing sector went from bad to worse in September, with the PMI survey indicating the steepest downturn for nearly seven years and sending increasingly grim signals for the fourth quarter..... Businesses also remain downbeat about the year ahead, with optimism around a seven-year low amid trade war worries, signs of slowing global economic growth and geopolitical concerns, including heightened anxiety over a disruptive Brexit. High street bakery chain Greggs says it’s taking steps to prevent disruption from a no-deal Brexit. Greggs told shareholders this morning that: We are preparing for the potential impact of the UK’s departure from the European Union by building stocks of key ingredients and equipment that could be affected by disruption to the flow of goods into the UK. Britons are already worried about disruption to key medicines after a disorderly Brexit, without the added threat of running low on steak bakes and vegan sausage rolls. In a trading update, Greggs also warned that its labour and food input costs are being pushed up. But it is pressing on with its autumn range, including the popular Pumpkin Spice Latte, and some new post-4pm meal deals (including pizza and a drink for £2). If people aren’t moving house, then they’re not buying new carpets and furniture. Sofas and carpets firm SCS has warned that its sales are down 7.6% in the last two months, partly down to Brexit. The period has been impacted by the record temperatures seen over the key August bank holiday weekend and the increased political and economic uncertainty that the UK is currently facing. Share in SCS have fallen 7% in early trading. Britain’s house price slowdown is firmly centred on London, as this map shows: Guy Harrington, CEO of property lender Glenhawk, blames Brexit for the slowdown in house price growth: If these were ‘normal’ times, we’d expect the favourable underlying drivers of low interest rates and high employment to be supporting a buoyant market. However these are unprecedented times and the record that is playing housing growth is stuck until the needle bounces over the Brexit bump, although that assumes that’s all it is.” Lucy Pendleton of independent estate agents James Pendleton points out that house prices have been lagging inflation for over a year: “Such low growth means September is set to be the 14th month in a row in which property has lost value in real terms. “The last time growth even equalled CPI was in July 2018 when both measures were running at 2.5% year on year. The last time the property market was ahead was in April 2018. “What this means is that there’s no mistaking this trend as a flash in the pan and it is being solidly reflected in buyer and vendor behaviour, particularly in London. Jonathan Samuels, CEO of property lender Octane Capital, fears that the housing market will weaken in the months ahead: “It’s a miracle that the market is holding up as well as it is given the level of political turmoil. Low supply and stock levels continue to support prices while cheap mortgages and the strong jobs market are steeling buyers’ resolve. The resilience of the property market looks set to be tested like never before in the final quarter of 2019. “To say it’s tin hat time is an understatement.” Iain McKenzie, CEO of the Guild of Property Professionals, reckons the housing market will pick up once Brexit is resolved. When the extension of Brexit was announced there was a spike in activity in the market, which again reiterates the fact that it is uncertainty holding buyers back rather than a lack of interest. Once activity starts to increase and buyer confidence returns, which it will, prices will start back on an upward trajectory.” Weak house price growth is obviously good news for those hoping to get onto the housing ladder. But despite the slowdown, houses are still relatively unaffordable, as this chart shows: This would obviously get worse if the Bank of England raised interest rates - although they’re more likely to cut them in the current climate. London’s housing market is leading the downturn, with prices sliding by 1.7% year-on-year in the last quarter, Nationwide reports. Prices in the ‘Outer Metropolitan’ region also fell, by 1.5%, reflecting the impact of Brexit uncertainty on the capital. Northern Ireland, though, has seen house price surge by 3.4% in the last year. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With just 30 days until Brexit, the UK housing market is being dragged down by uncertainty and worry. House prices fell by 0.2% in September, according to new figures from Nationwide. This pulled the average property price down to £215,352, from £216,096 in August. Over the last year, prices have only risen by 0.2%, well behind inflation (1.7%) and pay (+4%). And there’s a clear decline in the south, with London and the South East bearing the brunt. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, blames two factors -- the weakening global economy, and the ongoing Brexit saga. “UK annual house price growth almost ground to a halt in September, at just 0.2%. This marks the tenth month in a row in which annual price growth has been below 1%. “Indicators of UK economic activity have been fairly volatile in recent quarters, but the underlying pace of growth appears to have slowed as a result of weaker global growth and an intensification of Brexit uncertainty. However, the slowdown has centred on business investment – household spending has been more resilient, supported by steady gains in employment and real earnings. As these charts show, house price inflation has been dropping steadily since the UK voted to leave the EU: More to follow! Also coming up today We could get more grim news from Britain’s factory sector this morning. September’s manufacturing PMI report is expected to show that output shrank again across the UK last month. The eurozone’s factories also probably suffered a torrid month, hit by recession worries and the US-China trade war. The agenda 9am BST: Eurozone manufacturing PMI - expected to fall to 45.6, from 47 in August, showing a deeper contraction 9.30am BST: UK manufacturing PMI - expected to fall to 47, from 47.4, showing a deeper contraction 3pm BST: US manufacturing PMI - expect to rise to 51, from 50.3, showing a little growth
79	The largest offshore wind turbines ever built will begin powering millions of British homes using blades more than 100 metres long by the early 2020s. Each of the new mega-turbines planned for the world’s biggest offshore windfarm at Dogger Bank in the North Sea will reach 220 metres high and generate enough electricity for 16,000 homes. The turbines are almost a third more powerful than typical turbines used today, each dwarfing the size of the London Eye, and will help to reduce the cost of generating wind power. Together, the new generation turbines – built by GE Renewable Energy – will make up a windfarm capable of generating enough renewable electricity to power 4.5m homes from 130km (80 miles) off the Yorkshire coast, or 5% of the UK’s total power supply. The Dogger Bank project, to be built from next year in a joint venture between SSE and Norway’s Equinor, will be the largest windfarm in the world once it begins generating power in 2023. The pair is aiming to develop an “industrial wind hub” in the North Sea made up of three interconnected offshore windfarms using the GE Renewables’ turbines. John Lavelle, the offshore wind boss at GE Renewable Energy, said the deal with Dogger Bank would bring “the world’s most powerful offshore wind turbine to the world’s largest offshore wind market”. “We have an important role to play in the UK’s offshore wind ambitions and in delivering further carbon emission reductions,” he said. Dogger Bank is one of a new wave of offshore wind projects which will generate renewable electricity at no extra cost to consumers after a subsidy auction fell to record lows last month. Dogger Bank won a contract which will pay its developers around £40 for every megawatt hour of electricity produced, below the typical market price for electricity in the wholesale energy market. Bjørn Ivar Bergemo, the Dogger Bank Wind Farms project director, said the turbines represented a “step change” in offshore wind technology which helped the project achieve record low support prices.
80	Tokyo has begun to take shape on the horizon for the sailors who became Great Britain’s first athletes to be selected for next summer’s Olympic Games. Twelve sailors will compete across eight disciplines on the waters of Enoshima Harbour as Britain attempts to maintain its place at the top of the all-time sailing medal table. There are places for the 2016 gold medallists Hannah Mills and Giles Scott, as well as Olympians Luke Patience and Stuart Bithell – silver medallists at London 2012 – and Saskia Tidey, who represented Ireland at Rio 2016 but switched allegiance the following year. Speaking at a launch event on the Dorset coast, the venue of sailing events during London 2012, Team GB’s chef de mission, Mark England, said the team was “one of the most talented” in the 120-year history of British Olympic sailing. “Great Britain has fielded sailors in the Games since 1900 and that connectivity is really important,” he said. “The sailors will compete on the same water as our 1964 team. Keith Musto won a silver medal then [in the Flying Dutchman class] and I know everyone here will at least want to replicate him. “The team have been through a rigorous selection process over the last couple of years and whilst it is a blend of newcomers and experienced sailors, it does include within it world champions and four Olympic medallists. We believe it is one of the most talented sailing teams that we’ve ever taken to an Olympic Games.” Sailing has come to the front of the queue in terms of selection in recent cycles. Quota places for Tokyo’s 10 classes were decided in 2018, with qualifying following during the world championships this summer. Selection provides the rubber stamp, with the next 10 months giving necessary time for athletes to practise and plan for conditions in Tokyo. “It’s amazing to be chosen,” said Scott, who will seek to retain his gold in the Finn class. “We were the first named athletes four years ago and we’re the first named this time around. We’re on the leading edge of that Tokyo 2020 rollercoaster. It’s a special thing to be a part of, but we’re all after the same thing and that’s trying to win. “In sailing we only get one spot per nation and there’s only one representative per class,” he went on. “We’re an incredibly strong sailing team and the second or in some classes the third guy in the pecking order are capable of winning medals on the world stage. “So no one gets complacent but equally you need to be able to take a year to focus on one event and get everything in order. Which is why the selection committee and the sailors are always so keen to gain that spot a year out.” Scott has a busy year ahead as he will also compete in the Americas Cup as part of Ineos Team UK. He admits it will be something of a “balancing act” but believes more success is possible. “I need to make sure that I pay enough attention to each area of my sailing, but it is very doable and it’s been done in the past to great success,” he said. Team GB sailors Giles Scott (men’s Finn); Hannah Mills and Eilidh McIntyre (470 women); Luke Patience and Chris Grube (470 men); Charlotte Dobson and Saskia Tidey (49er FX women); Dylan Fletcher and Stuart Bithell (49er men); Alison Young (Laser Radial women); Emma Wilson (RS: X Women); Tom Squires (RS: X men)
81	The government is to spend £20m on tackling county lines drug networks, including recruiting more specialist caseworkers to deal with victims groomed into gangs, the home secretary has announced. County lines involves gangs in cities such as London, Birmingham and Liverpool using children as young as 11 to deal mostly heroin and crack cocaine over a network of dedicated mobile phones. In her speech to the Conservative party conference in Manchester on Tuesday, Priti Patel said the extra cash would stop gangs “terrorising our towns and villages and exploiting our children”. The package will be spent on expanding the National County Lines Coordination Centre and setting up a dedicated unit within the British Transport Police, which will deploy visible and undercover officers at railway stations to disrupt county lines activity. In the Behind the Lines series, the Guardian revealed the soaring number of cases in which vulnerable children are linked to gangs as well as cases of British victims of human trafficking who have been forced to sell drugs in county lines operations being charged and prosecuted despite guidelines against doing so. The number of individual phone numbers identified by law enforcement officials as being used on established county lines networks is about 2,000 and the illicit industry is estimated to be worth at least £500m. Patel’s speech focused heavily on policing and only briefly touched on other policy areas within her brief such as immigration. The address was full of tough-on-crime rhetoric that has become a staple of Boris Johnson’s domestic agenda. Addressing unspecified criminals, Patel said: “We are coming after you … We stand for the forces of right, and against the forces of evil.” The home secretary announced a £10m “safer streets fund” for police and crime commissioners to invest in preventive measures, such as CCTV and street lighting, to tackle burglaries, thefts and shoplifting in crime hotspots. Since becoming prime minister, Johnson and his cabinet have made a wave of justice-focused announcements, including increased use of stop and search, more police officers on the streets and a review of sentencing. Earlier in the session at the party conference, the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, in a pre-recorded video announced proposals to end automatic release at the halfway point of a prison sentence for more violent and sex offenders in England and Wales. Buckland said offenders guilty of violent and sexual crimes that carry a maximum sentence of life – such as manslaughter, rape, grievous bodily harm – and who were sentenced to at least four years in prison would be required to serve two-thirds of the sentence in prison before being released on licence. He also announced plans to roll out so-called sobriety tags nationally for use on offenders convicted of alcohol-related offences. The bracelets monitor blood alcohol levels and transmit them to a base station every 30 minutes. Those who fail to comply with the conditions are returned before the courts.
82	Leeds United are at the centre of a Football Association racism investigation after Charlton Athletic alleged that their on-loan forward Jonathan Leko was abused by a member of Marcelo Bielsa’s team last Saturday. The player in question is understood to be the 32-year-old Spanish goalkeeper, Kiko Casilla. The incident took place during the Championship match won 1-0 by Charlton and was included in the report of the referee, John Brooks, to the FA. That submission has prompted the governing body to speak to the clubs and individuals concerned before determining whether there is a case to answer. Leko is on loan at Charlton from West Brom – who were due to face Leeds in another second tier game on Tuesday night – and much will hinge on what he tells the FA. In a statement confirming that the allegation had been reported to Brooks during the match the south London club said they would be supporting the 20-year-old throughout the investigation. Like Charlton, Leeds were not prepared to comment further than to say they would be “working with the FA”. Under rules introduced for the 2019-20 season, the minimum suspension for a player found guilty of an aggravated breach of the FA’s discrimination rules is now six matches, which can be increased depending on any additional aggravating factors. Sophie Jones of Sheffield United women was handed a five-match ban this year after being found guilty of racially abusing Tottenham’s Renée Hector. Jones, who denied the charges and maintained her innocence throughout, left United by mutual agreement in March. Kick It Out, the anti-discrimination group, has also offered its support to Leko, who was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo and is an England Under-20 international.
83	Labour’s selection process for a new metro mayor has been plunged into acrimony after a leaked email showed that the shadow minister Naz Shah has accused a prospective candidate of being unfit for office. Shah, the shadow minister for women and equalities, is demanding that Salma Yaqoob should not be allowed to stand as mayoral candidate for the West Midlands. Shah claims Yaqoob should stand down because she ran a “despicable” general election campaign against her in Bradford West two years ago. Yaqoob, a former Birmingham councillor backed by Momentum’s leader, Jon Lansman, hit back, saying that Shah has refused to accept her public apology for standing as a Respect candidate, and is instead recycling vexatious claims. The row has been ignited after Labour’s national executive committee (NEC) gave Yaqoob permission to oppose the MP Liam Byrne and unions’ favourite, Pete Lowe, in the race to be selected as the party’s official candidate to take on the West Midlands Conservative mayor, Andy Street. Shah has written to the NEC this week claiming Yaqoob endorsed a campaign of misogyny, patriarchy and clan politics in 2017. Shah claimed she was driven to contemplate suicide after Yaqoob’s campaign exploited patriarchal politics, or biradri, among the city’s Kashmiri and Pakistani community. “This kind of clan politics, not underpinned by any political ideology but driven by men for the purpose of men to gain and retain power, has hindered the development of my city,” she said. “Despite giving me her word that she wouldn’t come to Bradford West after I explained this to her in detail, SY [Salma Yaqoob] still came and stood against me. In doing so I believe she endorsed misogyny, patriarchy and biradri politics. “If that wasn’t a betrayal enough by a Muslim woman who I once looked up to, SY then allowed a local imam at her campaign launch to ‘hijab shame’ me. ‘Who is the most Muslim, that is Salma Yaqoob,’ were his words whilst SY sat there and applauded,” she said. Shah claimed that Yaqoob’s campaign exploited Shah’s unconventional background – a divorcee raised on benefits by a single parent with a mother who was imprisoned for killing a man who had abused her – to win votes. “I feel that SY used my backstory to literally dishonour me, making me ‘unworthy’ within the community. She did this in full knowledge of the cultural dynamics of honour, patriarchy and misogyny,” Shah said. “To be questioned whether I was good enough by a bunch of patriarchal men, the misogynists in my community, in public, putting my character on trial for the sake of political gain with not a single word of condemnation but applause from SY is despicable,” she said. Shah, who included recorded clips of Yaqoob from 2017 in her submission, claimed the campaign drove her to consider suicide. “This personal attack on my honour and everything I stood for … made me feel suicidal on two occasions during that campaign,” she said. In the email, the MP for Bradford West has accused her own party of giving Yaqoob “special treatment” so she could stand to become a metro mayor. Labour sources insist the party went through the proper processes and Yaqoob’s candidacy was waved through because there were no other women or BAME candidates. Approached for a comment, Yaqoob denied ever exploiting Shah’s background, adding that it was “disturbing and manipulative” to say so. Yaqoob said she had consistently campaigned against the clan system and did not try to shame anyone. She said in a statement: “I would like to move forward in this campaign by recognising the problems of the past, honouring the pain felt on all sides and building collective support to deliver the very best for the people of the West Midlands under the Labour party. “I have always had an open-door policy and have not shied from taking constructive criticisms on board. I would like the opportunity for Naz to see the journey I have been on over the last couple of years, perhaps this is something that I can only demonstrate through actions rather than words.” • This article was amended on 2 October 2019. Salma Yaqoob is no longer a Birmingham city councillor. She served on the council between 2006 and 2011.
84	Jessye Norman’s voice was a force of nature, a gift from the gods. When you went to hear her sing, you always knew exactly what you would get. Sumptuous, creamy and voluptuous tone was Norman’s trademark, along with a meticulous attention to text and expression. For some, it was all too grand and undifferentiated, like a meal in which the richness of the food was overwhelming and unchanging in every course. But the sheer vocal splendour that Norman produced was the sort of sound that comes only once in a lifetime. Yet Norman was not just an unforgettable voice. She was an unforgettable public presence – an African American presence – in every event in which she participated. The knowingness that marked her vocal art extended seamlessly to her public conduct. Her choices on Desert Island Discs did not include her own recordings (which, given her personality, they might easily have done) but Martin Luther King’s “I have a dream” speech. She was a majestic figure in every sense, and she knew from the start of her career to the end that she was also an embodiment of her black brothers and sisters. She would never be anybody’s second-class citizen. And she never was. Norman was not the breakthrough African American singer of 20th-century America. Those imperishable accolades belonged to Marian Anderson and, a little later, to Leontyne Price, who each made the breaches in the whites-only world of classical music and opera. But she was in every way Price’s successor as the flag carrier for her people in the concert halls and opera houses of the US and the wider world. Like Price, she came from the south and developed her voice in church choirs. But, perhaps even more than Price, Norman embraced her iconic status in wider American life as an integral part of the gift she possessed. Norman’s operatic career had to take account of both her vocal richness and her substantial height. She never possessed an athletic stage presence, and she was not really an ensemble actor. The roles that suited her best were often statuesque, where her character’s emotional presence was able to dominate. Her Elizabeth in Wagner’s Tannhäuser and, in particular, her Cassandre in Berlioz’s Les Troyens, which she sang at Covent Garden, were characterisations of this kind. Later, she excelled in the title role of Strauss’s Ariadne auf Naxos, to which the tragic dignity of her vocal breadth was perfectly suited. Though she sang Mozart with total commitment, her voice was simply too big and her personality too grand to fit into such quicksilver writing. Stories of Norman’s imperious behaviour were common in the musical world. She could be uncompromising about the standards she expected from herself and others. And she was said to require to be collected in a Rolls Royce. But she never lost her lofty status as a great artist. When Herbert von Karajan, another difficult and imperious personality, was preparing for what was likely to be his final appearance at the Salzburg festival, it was Norman he wanted by his side, to sing Isolde’s Liebestod. Concerts were Norman’s ideal milieu, especially as her career entered its final years. Her range was great. She sang everything from art songs to spirituals. She was magnificent in large choral works, such as Schoenberg’s Gurrelieder under Pierre Boulez in the Proms at the Albert Hall. But she was the go-to singer for the great public American occasion, notably the presidential inaugurations of Ronald Reagan (about which, as a Democrat, she had trepidation) and later Bill Clinton. There may not have been many operas for which Norman was the ideal choice, but she was in every sense a larger than life and irreplaceable artist. ‘An unflinching connection to the eternal’ Rufus Wainwright, singer/songwriter Rarely do all the essential elements of the performing arts combine in one human being. Stature, intelligence, a sense of movement, attention to detail, generosity to the public and above all that voice. All of these plus a little bit of magic imbued La Norman with what I love most about opera: a solid and unflinching connection to the eternal. Thank you Jessye for lighting the path to the universe. ‘After dinner, she put on an apron and did the dishes’ Clive Gillinson, artistic director of Carnegie Hall, New York I got to know Jessye 50 years ago when I was a player, and then managing director, at the London Symphony Orchestra. We became friends: she had a house in London, and used to invite people round for the most spectacular dinners. She did the cooking and then we’d stand round the sink while she put on an apron and did the washing up! I remember also going dancing at Annabel’s with her – she was an incredible dancer. Very flamboyant, as you would expect. When I came to New York, one of the first things I did was develop citywide arts festivals, and I went to her home in upstate NY to ask if she would curate one on African American culture. I was nervous as I knew how busy she was, but she said to me: “Clive, I’ve been waiting my entire life to do this project.” She threw herself into it with incredible passion, thought and care – which was how she approached everything. ‘A big personality with a magnetic presence’ Lawrence Brownlee, tenor Her musicality, her versatility, her eloquence in many languages and her standing in the world of classical music made Jessye Norman an icon and a role model for every singer of any nationality and any colour. But for me, as a young black American singer, she inspired me and gave me belief and hope that I could be successful too. As an established singer, I met her several times. She invited me to give a recital at the school she helped set up – the Jessye Norman School of the Arts in her home town of Augusta, Georgia. Over dinner I discovered that she had been following my career, and even knew which show I was in. We kept in touch and she continued to watch and support me. She was at a stage in her life when she didn’t need to pay it forward, but she did, always. She was effusive in her compliments and really cared about me. She wanted to encourage me and my peers and see us succeed. She was undeniably a big personality, a magnetic and strong presence on stage. She was one of the last remaining divas, a very bold singer who brought commitment and charisma to everything she did. She was one of the greatest of her generation in German repertoire, but what I love about her was that as a musician she simply wanted to communicate. She dealt with racism, and she talked about people not wanting to give her her dues, but she was extremely resilient and focused. She let her voice speak for her. ‘She wasn’t going to let anyone stop her’ Judith Weir, composer We worked together on a song cycle, woman.life.song, that was at the Proms in 2000. It’s a project she dreamed up and was very intimately involved in the nitty gritty of shaping over the several years it took to develop. I remember she would send me very businesslike but charming faxes – now alas too faded to read. I wish I’d photographed them. I found her extremely professional, well informed and a joy to work with. I know she had a reputation for being a diva, but that was not my experience. She spent so much of her life on the road that I think her exacting demands (about, say, air conditioning) were born of her experiences of what could have and had gone wrong. At the Proms, I remember being struck by the audience she had brought in – it was the first time I’d seen so many people of colour there. Thank goodness things are changing now, but she was about 20 years ahead of her time. She knew that boundaries, whether of colour or gender, had to be broken and she wasn’t going to let anyone stop her. ‘Wide open spaces shrank in her hands’ Iain Burnside, pianist I never saw a singer dominate a space the way Jessye could. The wide open spaces of the Royal Festival Hall shrank in her hands. Every gesture, vocal and physical, carried to the back wall. I treasure her incredible spun line in Strauss’s Wiegenlied and her power in Zueignung. Her high-cheekboned smile will never be surpassed. She conveyed joy like no one else. A couple of years ago, I met her at a dinner and drove her back to her hotel. She squeezed my leg as she said thank you and I thought that my life was complete. ‘Jessye always gave 150%’ Lise Davidsen, soprano I’ve only been able to get to know her voice through her recordings – I wish I’d had the chance to see her live. But she has always been such an inspiration, an idol, for me, from the extraordinary colours of her voice, her amazing technique, to her choices in terms of repertoire. She always gave 150% and I love and admire her for the way she spoke out for our art form. She was always clear about how important classical music is and that it needs to be part of all our lives. It didn’t need justification. She showed that it doesn’t matter if you are a man, a woman, black or white – when you have a voice as great as that, you need to share it. ‘Despite the odds, she commanded attention’ Sir Willard White, bass baritone She approached everything she did, every role, with total commitment. She commanded attention, despite all the odds – in a way, she was actually inspired by the odds. She set such a high standard that she was intimidating and inspiring at the same time. Of her recordings, I would single out her Four Last Songs for its elegance and beauty. She showed how it should be done. ‘Jessye will live on in our hearts’ Joyce DiDonato, mezzo soprano The voice was instantly recognisable, the phrasing supreme, the persona larger than life, and the impact eternal. Jessye’s onstage legacy will remain with us all, but her impact off stage changed lives and will continue to live on through her towering example, mentorship, leadership and passion. She will live on in our hearts for ever. • Interviews by Imogen Tilden
85	The boss of Waitrose has quit the business as part of a radical overhaul that will merge the supermarket’s management with its John Lewis department stores sister chain in an effort to cut costs. The retailers’ parent group, the John Lewis Partnership, will axe one in three senior head office management posts – 75 out of 225 – as part of the reorganisation, which will save the company £100m. The posts of managing director for both Waitrose and the John Lewis department stores chain are being eliminated as the group cuts costs after falling to its first ever half-year loss. Rob Collins, who joined the group as a graduate trainee at the John Lewis Oxford Street department store in 1993 and rose to managing director of Waitrose, is expected to receive a payoff of about £1m – a year’s salary, although the company would not confirm the terms of his departure. Paula Nickolds, currently managing director of department stores, will become executive director of brand, heading marketing, service and digital innovation across the supermarkets and department stores group. Collins said: “I have been closely involved in the planning of the Future Partnership programme and I’m very confident that the new structure is the right one for the future. I am certain it will enable the business to continue its long history of successfully adapting to changing times. There isn’t a role in the new structure that I believe is right for me personally, and so I have decided to leave.” The restructuring comes just four months before the arrival of Sharon White as chairman of the group. White, currently chief executive of Ofcom, the broadcasting regulator, is an economist by training and has worked at the World Bank and British embassy in Washington, as well as in Tony Blair’s policy unit at No 10, but has no background in retail. In a statement she said she was “passionate about working together as one partnership” and there was “huge potential to unlock from partners working across our two great brands”. Last month the partnership revealed it had made an underlying pretax loss of £26m in the six months to 27 July compared with a profit of £800,000 in the same period a year before. Waitrose was the better performer, recording a profit of £110m, while the John Lewis department stores posted an underlying loss of £62m as shoppers shied away from big ticket purchases. Sales at both chains were down. Earlier this year the group slashed its staff bonus to 3% of salary – its lowest level in 66 years. Nickolds will sit on a new eight-strong executive board, which teams from both John Lewis and Waitrose will report to. Operations across both brands will be headed by Andrew Murphy, currently director of IT and transformation for the group, and Patrick Lewis – the great-grandson of the store chain’s founder – will continue as finance director. Bérangère Michel will head customer service and Tracey Killen will head people management. Two new directors – for trading and strategy – are being sought. Nickolds will no longer sit on the group’s partnership board, the company’s top management team. It will now have only two executive board members – Lewis and the incoming chairman, Sharon White – who will work alongside non-executives and directors elected by the group’s workforce. Sir Charlie Mayfield, the chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, said: “Our current structure has served us well in the past, enabling us to develop two of the UK’s most loved and trusted brands. “However, the lesson of the last two years is that we need more innovation, faster decision making and bolder steps to align our operating model with our strategy. This is what the Future Partnership is all about.” The company said its new structure would enable it to develop and set strategy across both its brands in one place, speed up decision-making and make internal and customer service systems more efficient. The group said it wanted to develop shared IT and supply chain platforms. The restructure is likely to fuel rumours that the group will close or downsize one of its two head offices – in London’s Victoria and Bracknell near Reading and cut further head office jobs next year. Thomas Brereton, a retail analyst for GlobalData, praised the group’s efforts to cut costs in a tough market. But he added: “Running a unified strategy for two retailers with such a varied proposition is questionable.” Richard Lim, the chief executive of analysis firm Retail Economics, described the changes as “an extremely bold move”. He added: “The merging of both businesses signals a single-minded focus on delivering cost-saving efficiencies, improving productivity and creating a harmonised proposition to leverage value from their customer base.” He said the changes would help the business deliver consistent service across its online and high street outlets.
86	Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has said his company will “go to the mat” if Elizabeth Warren is elected president and seeks to fulfil her promise to break up America’s tech giants. Having to mount a legal challenge, Zuckerberg said, would “suck for us”. In response, the Massachusetts senator said: “What would really ‘suck’ is if we don’t fix a corrupt system.” In leaked transcripts of July internal meetings published by the Verge on Tuesday, Zuckerberg identifies “a political movement where people are angry at the tech companies or are worried about concentration or worried about different issues and worried that they’re not being handled well”. He adds: “That doesn’t mean that, even if there’s anger … that you have someone like Elizabeth Warren who thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies.” The Massachusetts senator made her promise in March, saying in a blogpost: “Today’s big tech companies have too much power – too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They’ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.” Warren has performed strongly in recent polls, in some cases passing former vice-president Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic primary field. Last week, it was reported that key Democratic donors on Wall Street and in big business object to her plans on regulation and taxation and are threatening to sit out the election or back Donald Trump instead. If Warren is elected, Zuckerberg says, “I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don’t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government … it’s like, we care about our country and want to work with our government and do good things. “But look, at the end of the day, if someone’s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.” In tweets on Tuesday, Warren said she wanted to reform “a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy. “I’m not afraid to hold big tech companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon accountable.” In July, Facebook was fined $5bn by the Federal Trade Commission for privacy violations in connection with the Cambridge Analytica scandal. It was also fined $100m by the Securities and Exchange Commission for misleading investors on the risks involved in its use of personal data. Revenues soared regardless. In the transcripts, Zuckerberg also discusses the Libra cryptocurrency, his refusal to testify before foreign governments, competing with TikTok and other problems facing Facebook. On relations with the US government, he is asked if he is worried by the fine and “the rise of politicians like Senator Warren”. Zuckerberg says “breaking up these companies, whether it’s Facebook or Google or Amazon, is not actually going to solve the issues”. Addressing election interference and voter manipulation, the heart of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he adds: “You know, [breaking up big tech] doesn’t make election interference less likely. It makes it more likely because now the companies can’t coordinate and work together. “It doesn’t make any of the hate speech or issues like that less likely. It makes it more likely because now ... all the processes that we’re putting in place and investing in, now we’re more fragmented.” Zuckerberg draws laughter by saying Facebook’s “investment on safety” is “bigger than the whole revenue” of Twitter. In conclusion, he concedes there is a need for “a regulatory framework where people feel like there’s real accountability. But he also says “the direction of the discussion” is “concerning”. “I at least believe, I think, there are real issues,” Zuckerberg says. “I don’t think that the antitrust remedies are going to solve them. “But I understand that if we don’t help address those issues and help put in place a regulatory framework where people feel like there’s real accountability, and the government can govern our sector, then yeah, people are just going to keep on getting angrier and angrier. “And they’re going to demand more extreme measures, and, eventually, people just say, ‘Screw it, take a hammer to the whole thing.’ And that’s when the rule of law comes in, and I’m very grateful that we have it.” Zuckerberg acknowledged the leak in a post on Facebook on Tuesday. Though the transcript “was meant to be internal rather than public” he said, “now that it’s out there, you can check it out if you’re interested in seeing an unfiltered version of what I’m thinking and telling employees.”
87	If Rembrandt were alive today, claims Dulwich Picture Gallery, he’d be a cinematographer. It’s a very precise posthumous career choice. Why not a director, special effects wizard, installation artist … or even painter? But this inventive exhibition, which marks the 350th anniversary of Rembrandt’s death, is certain he’d be photographing films. It has even brought in Peter Suschitzky, cinematographer of The Empire Strikes Back, to help craft the show in a way that brings out the great artist’s genius for telling stories with light. I can’t help thinking that, as a cinematographer, Rembrandt would annoy audiences hugely. When the Game of Thrones makers dared to light a nocturnal battle scene as it might look in a world without electric light, many viewers expressed outrage. I liked it, not least because it was reminiscent of Rembrandt – you won’t find a more mysterious night than the one that engulfs the people hunched around a campfire in his wonderful Landscape With the Rest on the Flight into Egypt. What would those complainants make of a scene in which a maester sat reading in an inky-black room, as a philosopher does here? Or an elderly couple all but disappearing in the gloom of a chamber, lit just by a dwindling fire? These are typical of the extreme lighting effects that Rembrandt uses in this exhibition, in sublime paintings and prints lent from such great collections as the Louvre and Rijksmuseum. This is a show to delight art snobs with loans of the sheer quality of the Queen’s Christ and Mary Magdalene at the Tomb – except that it wants to be popular, and accessible, and to do so will kick Rembrandt blinking into the age of blockbuster film. Every exhibit has a screenplay-style caption that treats paintings as movie scenes. “INT. TEMPLE – DAY,” says the text for The Woman Taken in Adultery, lent by the National Gallery in London. “A WOMAN crouches on shallow stone steps in a pool of cold light, surrounded by a group of men. A PHARISEE lifts her veil … CHRIST listens.” It’s a nice gag, but it is done for every single picture in a way that verges on the obsessive. At the end of the exhibition, the wheeze climaxes in film-style credits for everyone involved. I half expected a post-credit joke in which the aged Rembrandt is slumping along a street in 17th-century Amsterdam when Captain America materialises to take him to paint a deathbed portrait of Iron Man. Rembrandt needs no movie references. What does it mean to present him as a kind of film-maker, telling stories in light? It is true as far as it goes, but inadequate. With Rembrandt, any such partial view misses the big picture of a truly universal artist. The exhibition ends with a selection of portraits including Dulwich’s own harrowingly dark-eyed melancholy youth, which may well be a picture of Rembrandt’s son Titus before he died at the age of 26. Nearby is Self-Portrait in a Flat Cap, from the Royal Collection. From 1642, the year he painted The Night Watch, Rembrandt depicts himself in black velvety headgear and a gold earring which displays his success. Then your gaze is grabbed by his lucid, all-seeing orbs which measure you up with that commanding mixture of judgment and compassion and you feel the full sense of inexplicable awe. At least Dulwich didn’t take a lead from that flat cap to compare Rembrandt with Peaky Blinders. With loans of this calibre by one of the greatest artists ever to hold a maulstick you can’t go wrong – but they have a damn good try. All we need is to have the paintings clearly lit and a chance to look at them in our own way. That is lost in at least one part of the show where I watched Suschitzky finalise a lighting scheme for Christ and Mary Magdalene at the Tomb. The audience sit on a bench to watch as we begin in darkness, then light gradually increases on the painting in a dawn effect. It holds at full lighting for a minute or so before plunging into gloom to restart the sequence. You’re supposed to listen to an audioguide for the accompanying soundtrack. But what if I don’t want an audioguide? And what if I want to look closely at the furrows and crinkles of Rembrandt’s paint? I’ll get asked by other visitors to move because I’m spoiling the film. That’s what the exhibition achieves: it replaces the self-directed effort of engaging with painting with the much more passive and remote experience of watching a film or video art. Ultimately, to claim that Rembrandt is a cinematographer and give his paintings arty mood-lighting is to try and reduce his genius to our own slipshod standards. Walter Benjamin once said that every document of civilisation was also a document of barbarism. Well, every celebration of past genius is also a reckoning with the dead. How do we measure up to Rembrandt’s light? Not very well, if we can’t tell the difference between what movies and television do and what Rembrandt did. It is precisely because he is more challenging and more satisfying than the visual clutter that surrounds us that we come back to him year after year and century after century. At its core, this exhibition does not seem to grasp the true uniqueness of Rembrandt. That’s a bad look in any light. At Dulwich Picture Gallery, London, from 4 October until 2 February.
88	Gigi Hadid’s position as head girl of the Instagram supermodel set was confirmed on Tuesday when she removed an interloper from the finale of Chanel’s fashion show in Paris. The prankster, the YouTube comedian Marie Benoliel, wore a monochrome tweed suit – a signature of the Chanel brand – and darted on to the catwalk before strutting between the models. She blended in so well that the venue’s security guards appeared unable to identify her and it fell to Hadid to face up to the trespasser and shoo her off the runway. On Benoliel’s YouTube channel, where she goes by the name Marie s’Infiltre, her biography reads: “Marie infiltrates everywhere, to better reveal the comic reality that is hidden in the news!” Earlier in the week she infiltrated an Etam presentation where she again passed undetected for some time as part of the show by wearing silver underwear. After the Chanel invasion she posted a picture of herself with Hadid online. A Chanel spokeswoman said the infiltrator had taken them by surprise but that “this is not the first time that she has done this”. “We are not going to make a drama out of it,” she added. “We would have preferred if it hadn’t happened.” The woman was “escorted to the exit by our security personnel afterwards”. Speaking after her stunt, Benoliel told the Guardian she had always dreamed of becoming a Chanel égérie, or muse, adding: “The suit I was wearing on the catwalk actually belongs to my mom and she has been wearing it since I was born. Chanel is eternal. My tribute was a desire to take part in this eternity for a few minutes.” She said her comedy was “an exhaustive satire about our society”. Over the past four years she has produced more than 100 YouTube videos “where I immerse myself in public events and situations”. The goal, she said, was to “show how funny some situations and sometimes extreme behaviours are … I am not making fun of people. I am pointing out how silly some people can be when they lack distance and thinking.” On her exchange with Hadid, she said: “Gigi was quite nervous and reacted quite aggressively to me. She clearly did not understand my comic approach. At some point I thought she was going to pull my hair and yell as if we were schoolgirls. “Gigi is obviously sublime and a fashion icon. I understand her reaction somewhat and continue to love her in spite of that.” When asked how she accessed the Chanel venue, which had tight security, she said: “Sorry, I am a lady and a lady can’t reveal her tricks I am afraid.” The incident did not derail the show, which was the first ready-to-wear collection produced entirely by Karl Lagerfeld’s successor, Virginie Viard. Viard was Lagerfeld’s longstanding “right hand”, first at Chloé and then at Chanel, and took over at the brand after his death in February. The set, assembled within the soaring art nouveau arches of the Grand Palais in Paris, was a 330-metre recreation of the city’s distinctive peach-coloured Lutetian limestone and zinc rooftops. Chanel’s sets are always spectacular – Lagerfeld’s famously consisted of aeroplanes and entire supermarkets – but this was evocative in a more understated way. It came with realistic signs of life: the creamy stone was infused with a smoky grey patina while the “zinc” (actually painted linoleum) was tarnished. Perhaps the most surprising part of the aesthetic, given that this was a spring/summer show, was that so many models wore black opaque tights. Hemlines were short, with A-line and puffball skirts cut to the mid-thigh, a departure from the longstanding midi hemline trend still seen at many of the other fashion houses. There was a kaleidoscope of tweed and boucle, from the opening look – a black suit jacket with short black kilt – to sturdy pink and red romper suits. The shoes were commercial and wearable, comprising patent flat and block-heeled sandals and the ever-popular cream and black Chanel two tones. Another standout section featured graphic, block-printed silk skirts, suits and jackets with “Chanel” in white block capitals. Viard has already shown resort and couture collections for Chanel, thoughready-to-wear tends to have the most impact. So far her output has been interpreted as quieter than the pop-art stylings of her predecessor. Some have seen Coco Chanel as the dominant influence in Viard’s pared-back take on house codes. Like many of the shows this season, Viard presented a simplified way of dressing, a heartening riposte to the frequent fashion brand impulse to pile on the merchandise on the catwalk. That aesthetic – with models often wearing many-layered outfits and carrying more than one handbag on the catwalk – can feel queasily like stuffification for shoppers increasingly tuned in to concerns about sustainability. The chimneys and roof windows in the set were found at flea markets, according to notes distributed to showers. Chanel is “committed wherever possible to recovering, recycling and/or reusing materials and elements used in the set design for the shows”, a spokesperson said. Founded by Coco Chanel as a small millinery boutique in 1910, Chanel is now a world megabrand. In 2018 its revenues rose 13% to $11.1bn (£9.1bn).
89	A young soldier who collapsed and died during a army fitness exercise on a hot summer’s day in the Brecon Beacons was one of 18 who dropped out, were withdrawn or fell ill, an inquest was told. Cpl Joshua Hoole, 26, died three years after three army reservists suffered fatal heat illness during an SAS selection march in the same area. Hoole, of 1 Rifles, was carrying 25kg (55lb) of equipment when he collapsed 400 metres from the end of the eight-mile annual fitness test course on 19 July 2016. The march in south Wales had been due to begin at 11am but started at 7am because particularly hot weather was forecast, the inquest in Birmingham heard on Tuesday. When the group arrived at the start of the exercise shortly before 6.30am, the temperature was 17C (63F). When the troops were half-way round, 10 had withdrawn, with one complaining of having a “pulsating head – feeling too hot”, and another having “difficulty breathing due to the heat”. An hour into the march, L/Cpl George Knight was withdrawn, and later described “blanking out and collapsing into a hedge”. Another soldier also withdrew after feeling “dizziness and confusion”. SSgt Richard Jones, a Royal military police investigator, said Hoole collapsed at 8.52am, and despite the efforts of base medics, paramedics, and an air ambulance doctor, was pronounced dead at 9.39am. In total, 18 out of 41 soldiers dropped out, collapsed or were withdrawn by the course directing staff, including Hoole. Jones told the inquest that Cpt Colin Newfer, had been interviewed under caution over an allegation that he invited Knight and other soldiers to change statements about what had happened. A 2017 defence service inquiry report concluded that Hoole, of Ecclefechan in Dumfries and Galloway, died as a result of an undiagnosed underlying medical condition, not as a direct consequence of taking part in the annual fitness test. The conclusion is being challenged by Phillip Hoole, the father of Joshua and a former soldier, who successfully applied for an inquest to be resumed into the death and believes there were organisational failings in the way the exercise was handled. Phillip Hoole told the inquest: “He was a young man that was going places, with a great future ahead of him. He shone his light on all of us. Had his life not been extinguished, I am sure that he would have achieved much more.” He added: “As a son, grandson, brother, friend, peer, leader and mentor or just an acquaintance, he had the ability to make you feel better about your own life. His life might have been extinguished but his love lives on, in all of us. Always swift and bold – and never forgotten.” Hoole’s inquest is being keenly watched by relatives of the three men who died in the SAS trial in the Brecon Beacons in July 2013. Louise Hunt, the coroner presiding in the Hoole inquest, concluded in 2015 that there were a “catalogue of very serious mistakes” made by many people involved in the planning and execution of the SAS march and called for changes to be made in how exercises are organised on hot days. Bryher Dunsby, the widow of one of the men who died in 2013, Cpl James Dunsby, said: “My wish is that the MoD chooses to be truthful and transparent during the course of this inquest. I hope that Joshua’s family and those closest to him get answers in a respectful and honourable way from the MoD.” The inquest continues.
90	Stephen Colbert The pressure of the impeachment inquiry is clearly getting to Donald Trump, said Stephen Colbert on Monday’s Late Show. This weekend, “the president and his allies all journeyed to the mountains of madness, where all meaning was devoured in the cavernous maw of stupid, and they all got on the crazy train for one reason: to try to confuse everyone about a very simple story”, joked Colbert. That story is called Don and the Giant Impeach, and it goes like this: “Once upon a time, Donald Trump called the president of Ukraine and asked the foreign leader to investigate Joe Biden. The end.” It should also be the end “of his presidency, you would think”, Colbert said, especially after an abridged transcript, released by the White House, of a phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, seemed to confirm allegations from a whistleblower in the intelligence community. Over the weekend, Trump went after the whistleblower, whose identity remains legally protected. “You know the phrase: hey, don’t kill the messenger?” Colbert asked. “Trump doesn’t know that phrase.” Trump tweeted, for instance, that he deserved to meet his accuser. Colbert issued a slight correction: “You only have the right to meet your accuser in a court of law. And I certainly hope you get that opportunity.” Seth Meyers “Reality is catching up with Trump as Democrats move forward with their impeachment inquiry and support for impeachment rises in the polls,” said Seth Meyers on Late Night. “And in response to all that, Trump is predictably losing his mind.” Meyers recapped a weekend of paranoid Trump tweets, including the president’s threats to punish the whistleblower who reported the Ukraine call and alleged cover-up to Congress. Trump’s rhetoric was “dangerous”, said Meyers. “The president is threatening arrest and imprisonment for people who dare to investigate his abuses of power. The only thing stopping our system from collapsing is that everyone just ignores him. “We’ve all gotten to the point where we just have to treat the president of the United States like a guy taking a shit in the subway car,” Meyers said. “At some point, everyone’s just gonna move to the other end of the country.” Meanwhile, Trump loyalists made the rounds on cable talkshows, especially Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer who is directly named in the whistleblower complaint. Meyers showed a clip from ABC’s This Week in which Giuliani, asked if he would acquiesce to congressional subpoenas, answered: “That is a question with a lot, a lot of implications. Believe it or not, I’m an attorney.” “I do not believe it,” Meyers answered. “I think you are a bunch of body parts sewn together and brought to life in a laboratory, and maybe, just maybe, some of the body parts were from attorneys.” Later on Fox News, Giuliani showed text messages discussing the Trump-Zelenskiy call from the state department official Kurt Volker and said: “The whistleblower falsely alleges that I was operating on my own. Well, I wasn’t operating on my own.” “I like that Rudy is trying to smear the whistleblower by pointing out the crimes they didn’t report,” said Meyers. Trevor Noah On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah turned to another arm of the impeachment investigation: a report from the New York Times, later confirmed by NBC News, that Trump pressured the Australian prime minister to help him discredit the Mueller report. The report is bad for “two reasons”, said Noah. “One, because it would mean Trump has been using the presidency as his personal vendetta machine. And two, it also means he’s been using world leaders as his personal errand boys.” The Australia story demonstrates, Noah said, “that what started as a scandal about a call to Ukraine is now snowballing bigly”. Democrats are moving to impeach, and polls are showing more Americans in favor of “proceedings to impeach his ass”. But luckily for Trump, “there’s a group of supporters that will never leave his side, and those are Republican lawmakers”. Noah recapped a laundry list of Trump loyalists deployed to defend the president by going after the whistleblower or, in the case of the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, falsely accusing a news anchor of adding “though” to “I want you to do us a favor, though,” from the Ukrainian call notes. “It’s no surprise most Republican lawmakers are standing with President Trump,” Noah surmised. “But what is a little surprising is that they’re arguing that not only did Trump not do anything wrong, but the real bad guy here is the one who reported the crime in the first place.”
91	Trade unions, farmers and residents have taken to the streets in the northern French city of Rouen, demanding the government publish all data on the impact of a huge fire at a chemical factory amid fears for health and the environment. The government has by criticised by residents and environmentalists since the fire broke out early last Thursday at a storage facility owned by Lubrizol, a manufacturer of industrial lubricants and fuel additives that is owned by the billionaire US investor Warren Buffett. The blaze raged for nearly 24 hours last week, sending acrid black smoke billowing for miles around. The state has banned the harvesting of crops and sale of all produce of animal origin from a wide area in the region as a precaution while awaiting tests. Some farmers have been forced to dump tens of thousands of litres of milk in the past few days. Many residents have said they did not feel reassured by local authorities’ statement this week that – despite the strong smell of hydrocarbons hanging over the city – people can “live and work absolutely normally”. State authorities said tests showed no harmful toxins in the air or city water. Schools reopened this week after closing for a few days for intensive cleaning to remove black soot, but some staff in secondary schools refused to go back to work, saying children were suffering from headaches. Corinne Lepage, a former environment minister, lawyer and environmentalist, lodged a legal case this week urgently demanding all information on the fire, saying it seemed the state was only revealing partial details. For days, residents have demanded a full list of chemical products that burned in the fire. The French prime minister, Edouard Philippe, on Wednesday finally told parliament a list would be made public. Earlier, Philippe had told residents in Rouen that the lingering smell was “a nuisance” but not dangerous. He promised transparency by the state. After the fire, residents were told not to eat fruit or vegetables from gardens without washing them thoroughly, and not to touch the soot or other particles on the ground. Fire officers who fought the blaze were being tested to determine the impact to their health. The day after the fire, France’s health minister said she could not guarantee there was no risk to the public after the massive fire spewed smoke and soot. “The city is clearly polluted,” Agnès Buzyn said after visiting the scene, adding: “I cannot guarantee that there is no danger. There are of course traces of hydrocarbons.” Fears and mistrust over the official government line about the Rouen fire follows concerns about possible health risks from the Notre Dame cathedral fire in Paris. An environmental group has filed a lawsuit in the capital saying swift action was not taken to contain potential lead poisoning from the cathedral blaze.

147	There is a plaque on the wall at Rugby School, commemorating the exploits of William Webb Ellis, who “with a fine disregard for the rules of football first took the ball in his arms and ran with it”. There are reasons to be suspicious about this origin myth. Like the idea, wildly implausible to anyone even vaguely acquainted with the species, that any self-respecting English PE teacher would have praised Webb Ellis’s wit and ingenuity rather than cursed him for his pig-ignorance and set him to doing press-ups in punishment. Still, that’s the story and, two centuries later, it’s Webb Ellis’s name on the trophy that they’re all playing for over here in Japan. For a game that started with “a fine disregard” for the rules, rugby has grown into one that has become irritatingly pernickety about them. This World Cup tournament is supposed to be all about opening the game up to a new audience. One of the main sponsors is running an ad campaign about a confused man in a crowd of rugby fans who isn’t sure whether or when he is supposed to be cheering, until he finally realises it doesn’t much matter anyway. “You don’t need to know all the rules,” their slogan goes. A good thing, too, because they have grown so byzantine that even the experts don’t always seem to agree on them any more. Throughout the opening rounds of this tournament it felt like every other match ended in a spat about who hit who how, when and why and where they did it, and exactly what their punishment ought to be. And all that’s before you even get into the tit-for-tat whatabout of what the guy on the other side got up to in the 52nd minute. The referees don’t seem to agree with the judicial committees, who keep clashing with the coaches, whose players seem to be confused about what they are being told to do by World Rugby, whose instructions seem to be at odds with a lot of what the referees are doing on the field. So we have seen tackles the referee and television match official didn’t think were worth so much as a penalty, but which the disciplinary panel then decided deserved a three-week ban. Tackles that, one head coach was convinced, should have cost the opposition a penalty try, but which went entirely unpunished. Tackles where the referee and television match official agreed there were mitigating circumstances, but the disciplinary panel didn’t, so the players who made them ended up being given the very same sentence as the guy whose appallingly cynical shoulder charge damn near decapitated the man at whom it was aimed. “I am embarrassed here,” said Australia’s head coach, Michael Cheika. “I do not understand any more.” Well, Cheika tends to blow hard when he’s hot. But it’s not just him. After Samoa had two players suspended, their defence coach, Alistair Rogers, put in a special request to World Rugby’s high-performance manager, Alain Rolland, for more clarity on exactly what his players were supposed to be doing in the tackle. This was just days after Rolland told us all he was confident that the teams all understood the details of the new high tackle framework because he and his deputies had personally briefed them on it all right before the tournament. The strange part is that reason they introduced this new framework was so that, as one of the men who designed it explained in a recent podcast, everyone can look at the same tackle and see the same thing. It’s all part of World Rugby’s effort to overhaul the entire culture of the sport. Which they need to do, and soon, because a game where some concussed players are launching negligence lawsuits against their clubs, and others are being forced into early retirement on medical advice, isn’t going to have much of a long-term future, however many new fans it makes in these few weeks. World Rugby’s research shows that 76% of the concussions happen in the tackle, and that the chances of suffering one are 4.3 times higher if the tackler is upright rather than bent at the waist. So that is what they are trying to cut out. And they argue, rightly, that the debate that has lit up around these incidents is a sign that the culture of the game is already starting to change. They say the way fans and journalists swarm around slo-mo replays of these moments shows that people are starting to cotton on to the need to deal with a problem the sport has ignored for years. They are even prepared for the coaches to kick back at it, because they know that they will complain about anything which compromises their team’s performance. What is more problematic is that lack of consistency between what they are saying, what the referees and television match officials are doing, and the judicial review groups are deciding in those hearings. Between them, they are delivering mixed messages. It feels like there has been a communication breakdown. It was a bad omen that no one at the ground has been able to listen to the conversations between the refereeing team during this World Cup because the special ref mic app World Rugby has developed has been broken since the beginning of the tournament. This is difficult stuff, players and referees are making split‑second calls. But right now, World Rugby has got a lot of angry coaches, confused players, inconsistent officials, and befuddled fans. This change in the game is for the good, but it has a long way to go yet.
148	‘It hasn’t been easy,” says Ben Elton, “trying to decide what to talk about.” You don’t say. His new standup show is stuffed to bursting with Elton’s takes on identity politics, post-truth, and every other cultural phenomenon since he last performed live comedy 15 years ago. It’s not a perfect return: there are missteps, lapses into fogeyism, and sometimes it’s more sermon that standup. But there’s big-hitting stuff here, too, and – as passionate as ever, 30 years on from his Thatcher-bashing heyday – Elton’s open and inquisitive engagement with the thorniest corners of modern living is bracing to experience. Having watched Messrs Carr, Gervais, Chappelle and others recently, I was ill-prepared for this level of humility from a middle-aged male standup faced with a fast-changing world. That’s the subject of Elton’s show: not only that “I don’t understand any more”, but that today’s world is so confusing, he now worries he never understood anything in the first place. What’s refreshing is that Elton – rather than fleeing towards old certainties – embraces the confusion, at least in principle. There’s a have-cake-and-eat-it dynamic at play, in that he repeatedly asserts his support of new developments in culture (particularly relating to gender and sexuality), while exploiting the humour of his predicament as a sexagenarian at sea in the modern world. He takes “pale, male and stale” on the chin, admitting this is “a limp, wrinkly Caucasian scrotum of a show”. His material on sexuality as a spectrum and trans awareness (“I used to know I was a man”) is disarmingly open-ended. So, too, a section on Germaine Greer’s journey from feminist hero to feminist pariah, the final line of which gets a laugh despite clearly not being meant as a joke. Does that mean Elton isn’t in control of his material? Occasionally, perhaps – a section on his father’s Alzheimer’s is awkwardly framed. But, more often, he treads deftly the delicate line between respect for a new generation’s truths and vestigial loyalty to his own. And he repeatedly finds the funny while doing so, with his striking line about all men sharing Harvey Weinstein’s bathrobe, a lurid future projection of his kids’ generation conga-ing to Kanye in their care homes, or his vision of what Tomorrow’s World might have looked like had Maggie Philbin really known what was in store for us. As he cartoon-stomps around the stage, the rhythms of 80s-era Elton are vividly summoned by, say, his early routine (“I’ve got the Alz”) about his fear of looming senility. Yes, conservatism creeps in, particularly after the interval, as he laments the advent of the internet, sourdough bread and craft beer. It’s usually self-aware and sometimes very droll, as when Elton protests at other people’s fingers “fossicking” (lovely word) in the rock salt. But the contention that everything was better “when I was a kid” gets a little over-insistent. There’s too much in the show – he’s no sooner started on Orwellian workplace terminology than he’s jumped those tracks to decry the Americanisation of the UK. Then – after he ardently debunks the myth that Boris Johnson is funny – the jokes fall away and Elton sounds a sonorous alarm at our looming “new dark age”. At its best, this is a show that’s intensely engaged with how we live now, from a comic who’ll grant you pale and male while humbly contesting the sell-by date. • At Glasgow Pavilion, 1 October; then touring until 20 December.
149	The former digital minister, Margot James, has said she was “totally appalled” that a government scheme she had championed to foster UK cyber skills benefited an American businesswoman at the centre of a conflict of interest row involving the prime minister. Margot James had successfully argued for the expansion of the cyber skills immediate impact fund (CSIIF) when it was used to award £100,000 earlier this year to Hacker House. The company was founded and run by Boris Johnson’s friend Jennifer Arcuri after she had moved back to the US. James said she would be “very surprised” if Johnson had had any involvement in awarding the grant, but admitted the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Skills [DCMS] made a “big mistake” in awarding the money to Arcuri’s company. Speaking to the Guardian, she said: “It is a complete mystery to me how this company got anywhere near the money.” The DCMS has launched a review into how the grant was made and withheld £53,000 that is yet to be transferred to Hacker House. James, who resigned as a minister a week before Johnson became prime minister, said: “I’m totally appalled that the money was awarded to this company. Although it didn’t get my sign-off I was the minister responsible at the time, so that’s why I want to know now, belatedly, what happened.” Matt Warman, a DCMS undersecretary, insisted last week that the department had done the “usual due diligence” over Hacker House before awarding the money. “This is a company that is based in Britain as far as Companies House is concerned. It is a company with a British phone number,” he told the Commons. But when the Guardian phoned the UK number it got through to the US and when a reporter visited its UK-registered address he was told it was a “virtual office” and staff were based elsewhere. James, who is one of 21 Tory MPs to have had the whip removed after rebelling on Brexit, said doubts about the company’s links to the UK were “obvious a mile off”. She added: “Anyone can register at Companies House and provide a British number.” She pointed out that the grant was designed to foster UK skills and was eligible only for genuinely UK-based companies. “We need the digital skills gap to be closed in the UK, not the bloody US,” she said. James said she was alarmed to discover that in the case of Hacker House, the DCMS appeared to have waived a requirement for grants not to be awarded if they exceeded 50% of the company’s turnover. Asked if she thought officials had been hoodwinked, she said: “I think that is the kindest explanation. I didn’t insist on ministerial oversight of the various applications. Perhaps I should have done with the benefit of hindsight. I would have look at the revenues and thought what’s going on here. We don’t want startups, we need companies with a proven track record.” James also called for a “full and frank” review into what went wrong and for the department to avoid a government tendency to “close ranks”. She said: “I don’t think anyone has got any chance of sweeping it under the carpet. It is too out in the open now.” Separately, it has emerged that when Arcuri first launched a website for Hacker House in 2015, it included a promotional video featuring Johnson endorsing her previous company, Innotech, and referring to Arcuri by her first name. In the video, Johnson says: “Viva Innotech folks, and forward with all your deliberations. Will that do, Jennifer? Can I go now?”
92	Name: Pretend Socialists. Age: They’re pretend, so it doesn’t matter. Appearance: See above. Are you suggesting these pretend socialists don’t exist? Oh, they exist. They’re everywhere you look. Where, exactly? In the Conservative party. Well, this is big news. When did this happen? You’ll have to ask Philip Davies MP. Speaking at a fringe meeting at the Tory conference, he railed against “flaky, would-be pretend socialists or politically correct stooges chosen simply because of their gender or because of the colour of their skin”. Doesn’t he mean pretend conservatives? A pretend socialist is someone who votes Labour but really likes the bread at Waitrose. Either way, he suggested the influx of politically correct stooges is a big problem. “If we had more actual conservatives in the House of Commons, the country wouldn’t be in the mess it is at the moment.” Remind me how many BAME MPs are Tories at the moment? At the time of going to press, 18. And what percentage of the overall party is that, roughly? About 6%. And how many are women? About 21%. Not exactly awash, then. The numbers don’t matter to Davies. “I think we will only have true equality when we don’t think about somebody’s sex or their or race or their sexuality or anything else, for that matter,” he said. So how does his support for true equality manifest itself? Through routinely opposing legislation aimed at protecting women and the LGBT community. Of course. After failing, by filibuster, to wreck the Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence (Ratification of Convention) bill in 2017, Davies was the only person in parliament to vote against it. He’s no pretend socialist, is he? He’s all about fairness. That’s why he called for the minimum wage to be scrapped in 2009. But the Tories just proposed raising the minimum wage! You can see why he’s worried. Davies is also a prominent men’s rights activist, speaking at events organised by groups including Justice 4 Men and Boys. Anything else, while we’re here? Davies once wrote to the chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s to ask what was so offensive about blacking up. Is that it? He’s engaged to the failed Tory leadership candidate Esther McVey. And does she know about all this? I’m guessing she does, yes. Do say: “We must continue the fight for liberation from our feminist and minority overlords.” Don’t say: “This bread is amazing, comrade. Where did you get it?”
93	In the run-up to a potentially record-breaking auction of his work at Sotheby’s, to be held on Thursday, the street artist Banksy said he had been forced into taking the unusual step of opening his own homewares store following a legal dispute with a greetings card company. Gross Domestic Product mysteriously opened in Croydon on Tuesday on the site of a former carpet shop. It will trade for the next two weeks – though will never open its doors, with all sales being made online. Banksy said the motivation behind the venture was “possibly the least poetic reason to ever make some art” – a trademark dispute. “A greetings card company is contesting the trademark I hold to my art,” he said in a statement. “And attempting to take custody of my name so they can sell their fake Banksy merchandise legally.” The famously anonymous artist said he thought the card company was “banking on the idea” he would not show up in court to defend himself. He plans to sell a range of merchandise, which is described as “impractical and offensive” and includes disco balls made from used police riot helmets. Other items in the shop, which will have its lights on for 24 hours a day, include sofa cushions with the inscription “Life’s too short to take advice from a cushion” and a gravestone bearing the inscription: “You have now reached your destination.” Mark Stephens, an arts lawyer and founder of the Design and Artists Copyright Society, called the case a “frankly ludicrous litigation” and is giving Banksy legal advice. “Banksy is in a difficult position,” he said. “Because he doesn’t produce his own range of shoddy merchandise and the law is quite clear – if the trademark holder is not using the mark, then it can be transferred to someone who will.” Stephens proposed that Banksy begin his own range of merchandise and open a shop as a solution to the issue. The artist said the proceeds will go towards buying a new migrant rescue boat to replace one confiscated by the Italian authorities. “Sometimes you go to work and it’s hard to know what to paint, but for the past few months I’ve been making stuff for the sole purpose of fulfilling trademark categories under EU law,” the artist said, admitting the subject matter is “not a very sexy muse”. Other items for sale include a toddler’s counting toy, where children are encouraged to load wooden migrant figures inside a haulage truck, a clock with a rat illustration and a handbag made from a house brick. Earlier in the year Stormzy headlined Glastonbury while wearing a stab-proof vest with a union jack on it, which was made by Banksy, who wrote on Instagram: “I made a customised stab-proof vest and thought – who could possibly wear this? Stormzy at Glastonbury.” Replicas of the vest are also for sale in the shop. Banksy’s painting Devolved Parliament will be auctioned at Sotheby’s on Thursday and is expected to sell for between £1.5m and £2m, almost exactly a year to the day since his work Girl With Balloon was shredded moments after being bought for £1m.
94	Publisher Penguin Random House has dismissed claims that Lara Prescott, a debut novelist who received a $2m (£1.6m) advance for her novel about the publication of Boris Pasternak’s Doctor Zhivago, infringed the copyright of Pasternak’s great-niece Anna Pasternak as “simply without any merit”. Published in September, Prescott’s The Secrets We Kept tells of how the CIA planned to use Doctor Zhivago as a propaganda tool during the cold war. But Anna Pasternak revealed in the Sunday Times that she had sent a legal letter to Prescott, claiming that the novel features “an astonishing number of substantial elements” copied from Pasternak’s 2016 biography Lara, which is about Olga Ivinskaya, Pasternak’s lover, muse and inspiration for his character Lara. The letter sees Anna Pasternak claim that similarities “exceed the mere inspiration a novelist may legitimately draw from a work of non-fiction”. She is seeking damages or compensation for the alleged infringement of copyright. An event with both authors at the forthcoming Cheltenham Literature festival – sponsored by the Sunday Times – has now been cancelled due to “unforeseen circumstances”. On Tuesday, Penguin Random House said that it and Prescott considered Anna Pasternak’s claim to be unfounded. “If proceedings are in fact issued, they will be robustly defended,” said the publisher. “Anna Pasternak’s claims are simply without any merit, and it is disappointing that she has chosen to litigate in the press rather than wait for the response to her letter of complaint within the timeline requested by her own lawyers.” Penguin Random House pointed out that the story of Olga Ivinskaya has been the subject of multiple books before Anna Pasternak’s, including Ivinskaya’s 1978 autobiography, a book by her daughter Irina Emelyanova, and Peter Finn and Petra Couvee’s 2014 book The Zhivago Affair. “The subject matter of both books is one of historical record and has been covered by other books in the past,” said the publisher. When it was published in 2016, Lara was billed as: “The untold love story that inspired Doctor Zhivago”. A New York Times review said that “the ‘untold’ in the subtitle simply isn’t true” because “the story of Pasternak’s affair with Olga has been told repeatedly”. It concluded: “Pasternak fans and incurable romantics will be better off sticking to Doctor Zhivago, or searching out the earlier memoirs that serve as this new book’s central sources.”
95	Just in case you need a recap – there is quite a lot going on in the news at the moment, so sometimes even the most significant stories can slip under the radar – there have been two major style events taking place simultaneously over the past week. One in Paris, where it is fashion week, and one in Cape Town, where the Duchess of Sussex is based during the royal tour, making for another kind of fashion week. Here’s the thing: the key fashion news from each is the same. Your dress for next season? It’s your dress for this season. Your new look is clothes you already wear, and a style you already have. In the past week, Meghan has worn two dresses that she wore on last autumn’s visit to Tonga: a blue shirtdress by Veronica Beard, and a dark striped sundress by Martin Grant. Now, first things first: clearly it is ludicrous that a woman wearing a dress twice is in any way a news story. But it is. Meghan’s “recycling” of her wardrobe has sparked a hundred headlines this week. Along with her denim jacket and her cross-body handbag, the dresses seem to be part of a soft relaunch of the Sussexes as low-key and relatable, post the whole private jet thing. But they also make for a new kind of fashion statement from Meghan: that her way of being a style icon doesn’t need to depend on an endless display of new clothes. In Paris, fashion designers made the same point, in a slightly different way. Natacha Ramsay-Levi at Chloé and Sarah Burton at Alexander McQueen were both at pains to point out the looks on their catwalk this season that were tweaked versions of looks they had done before. Burton talked about “not throwing things away, of returning to pieces and working with them instead of always moving on so fast”. Ramsay-Levi said she wanted to make it clear that Chloé clothes are not intended to be disposable. And all over the Paris catwalks, everywhere from Celine to Valentino, and from Christian Dior to Isabel Marant, the new collections spoke for themselves by being very much in the same vein as what we have been wearing for the past few seasons. I’m talking about a loose-ish dress that falls to below your knees, or just above your ankles. A kind of 70s Paris vibe. Not exactly bookish, but definitely a bit cultured. Possibly a bit flirty but in that borderline-grumpy French way, not in the giggly eyelash-fluttery way. A bit like how I imagine it would have been to dress as a “modern woman” in Saint Germain in the days when that just meant you bought your own red wine and cigarettes in Café de Flore, before it all got really complicated. (Yes, I do realise it wasn’t ever actually that simple, but just indulge me a moment in a little rose-tinted hindsight, thank you so much.) The look is glamorous, but via a trench coat and a bit of a heel and chunky gold jewellery, rather than scrappy sandals and diamonds. A long loose dress is the one piece that almost every woman I know has added to her wardrobe in the past two years. The white and black polka-dot tiered Zara dress that went viral this summer is the poster girl for the look. Yours might be that one, or it might be a different one, but I bet you have got (at least) one. Next season’s dress looks a little different – or can be made to look a little different – because it has a bit more of a waist. Utilitarian shirt dresses are edging out the more out-of-office kaftan-styled vibe, so lots of next season’s dresses have a row of buttons running flush to the body down the front, which lends them shape. And there are belts, too, suddenly. Not the kind that are a strip of fabric to match the dress, but proper belts, the sort you have probably got in a shoebox somewhere even if you haven’t worn them for ages. At Alexander McQueen, loose white dresses were worn with wide, sturdy black belts. At Chloé, Celine and Chanel, the belts were metal chain belts, softly weighting the fabric close to the body rather than cinching it in. At Dior’s garden-themed show, floral dresses were softly waisted with braided and woven belts. What else is changing? Boots are knee-length rather than ankle-length, and in black or snake print or gold, rather than white. The gold accent chain belt will be to the next year what the optic white ankle boot has been to the last year – that is, the outfit detail that datestamps you as Very Now. Gold is the new beige – at both Celine and Saint Laurent, some of the absolutely standout dresses of very desirable collections were in soft gold – and gold as an accent colour, whether in a pair of boots or a chain belt, a chunky necklace or a Lurex thread running through a silk blouse, has been a recurring theme of the clothes I have seen this week on the catwalk, in the audience, and in the street-style crowds outside the shows. The coats that look right now are the coats that work over these dresses – loose and unstructured, like the black coat worn over a striped dress at Stella McCartney, or oversized blazers. For casual looks, jeans are on their way back, as are denim midiskirts. Jumpsuits are very much still a thing – see Meghan in a black one in Cape Town, and Gigi Hadid on the Isabel Marant catwalk. Culottes and longline shorts are definitely happening. (I am sceptical, to be honest. They looked very elegant at Valentino, but then Valentino can make anything look elegant.) White shirts and silk blouses are bankable for a good few more seasons. If you want to elevate things a notch or two, ditch the polite florals for bold neon, or a neckline plunging narrowly to your bottom rib, as at Valentino. The new-look dress is, literally, everywhere. It’s in Paris, it’s in Cape Town – and it’s already in your wardrobe. Next season’s look? You’ve got this.
96	SPURRED ON If revenge is a dish best served cold, then Bayern Munich will be hoping to plate up a three-course meal of chilly retribution on a bed a permafrost and sprinkled in ice-shavings, all washed down by a bottle of vintage liquid hydrogen at White Hart Lane. The German champions have won 22 Bundesliga titles, two Big Cups, 13 German Cups, one Euro Vase and one Club World Cup in the past 35 years, a tidy haul of shiny pots they would happily surrender for the chance to hop in the club DeLorean, set the date for 7 December 1983, go through the gears until they hit 88mph and head back in time for another crack at the second leg of their Euro Vase third-round second leg defeat at the hands of Tottenham. It was the last time the clubs met, an occasion when a 26-year-old maestro named Glenn Hoddle conducted the orchestra as goals from Steve Archibald and Mark Falco helped Spurs overcome a first-leg deficit, advance to the next round and eventually win their second piece of European silverware. In the intervening years, Tottenham have added another three trophies to their roll of honour, compared to Bayern Munich’s 39. Is it any wonder those Germans are stewing? “We need to be ready both physically and mentally to find answers for the questions they will give us,” trilled Bayern manager Niko Kovac, upon being asked if he thought his team would need to be ready both physically and mentally to find answers for the questions they will give us. Meanwhile in Manchester, Pep Guardiola is preparing the Premier League champions for their first ever match against Croatian side Dinamo Zagreb. It being one of those special European nights, Manchester City fans are expected to temporarily halt their relentless bleating about media bias against their club, to free up time for moaning about Uefa bias against their club. The Etihad Stadium has yet to light up the “House Full” signs for a Big Cup group game under Pep’s watch and the chances of them doing so here seem supermodel slim. “I know for the fans it’s the Premier League that is most exciting,” parped Pep. “We’ve done polls and the people prefer by far to win the Premier League than [Big Cup].” Given the world’s wealthiest club’s perplexing ongoing inability to win Europe’s main competition, The Fiver can’t help but wonder how those canvassed could possibly know.

97	It is the census that utterly shames us as a nation. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the number of people dying homeless is at an all-time high. An estimated 726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018, a 22% rise on 2017. The biggest rise was in drug-related deaths, up by 55% since 2017. This, in one of the world’s richest nations, is a moral emergency – and it demands emergency action. Since I lost my dad to a tragic lifelong struggle with drink, I’ve worked with Birmingham’s homeless community. What drives me is the simple realisation that so many people sleeping rough are self-medicating for trauma and distress with drugs and alcohol in exactly the same way my dad did. That trauma and distress could hit any one of us. Everyone I’ve ever met sleeping homeless has been hit, hurt and knocked down by some sort of twist of fate. But the destruction of Britain’s safety net – what we once called social insurance – means there is now nothing to catch us. The rollback of every public service now means our social security is in systems failure. In the cold night in our shopping arcades, you can find newcomers “without recourse to public funds” forced to sleep rough. I’ve seen young men newly out of prison, released without any care for where they went. Last week, I met Anthony, who had been sleeping rough since he was heavily sanctioned by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), and who had lost the fingers on one hand. I’ll never forget finding a disabled man when I was out with a team of volunteers – ashen grey, crying in pain, next to his wheelchair in an underpass that stank of urine. He’d been there for three days, still dressed in his hospital gown, with a tag on his wrist. It took us two hours to get him an ambulance. This is the new normal. Especially at risk are those who grew up in our care system – like young Kane Walker, whom the Guardian featured this week. His death in January shocked our city. At his memorial service, homeless citizens lit candles in his memory. We cannot go on like this. But we cannot make homelessness history unless we confront the harsh realities of what’s happening. This is why I’m pressing for changes to the law. We urgently need what I’ve called Kane’s Law, to create a duty on public agencies, especially the DWP, the NHS, mental health services and the prison service to work with councils to prevent homelessness. We need reviews for everyone who dies homeless, so that the inconvenient truths of life and death cannot be ignored. One of our region’s homelessness campaigners once said to me: “Remember, we’re not trying to get rid of ‘houselessness’. We’re trying to get rid of homelessness. A home is where you feel safe, warm, loved.” Compassion is still the greatest quality of this nation. We used it once to build a country where we all looked after each other. That is the mission around which good people must now unite, before hundreds more die on our streets. • Liam Byrne is Labour MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill and former chief secretary to the Treasury
98	A senior Conservative MP has been asked to leave the party’s conference after police were called to an incident in which he allegedly behaved in a “totally unacceptable” fashion. Officers were asked to attend the international lounge at the conference in Manchester at Tuesday lunchtime after reports of an incident involving Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a party spokesman confirmed. The 66-year-old backbencher, who represents the Cotswolds, was knighted in 2018. Police said the MP attempted to bring someone into the lounge who did not have a relevant pass and was understood to have then remonstrated with a member of staff. Security then intervened. A party spokesman said: “The incident was totally unacceptable. Geoffrey has been asked to leave conference and we are establishing all of the facts to see if further action is necessary. We will always adopt a zero tolerance approach to any inappropriate behaviour towards our hardworking staff.” Clifton-Brown did not deny the reports, and told PA Media: “I’ve got nothing further to say about it. I don’t want to comment on it, really.” PA Media reported that a staff member guarding the door of the lounge, which is for international visitors to the event, said the incident was sparked by a disagreement. “It was a small misunderstanding,” the man said. Paramedics were in attendance and security staff shut down entrances and exits into the media lounge and covered the glass window leading into the lounge for about 30 minutes. In a statement, Greater Manchester police said: “At around 1.45pm on Tuesday 1 October 2019, an attendee to the Conservative party conference attempted to enter the international lounge area of the conference without the relevant pass. “Security staff intervened and resolved the situation without any breach of security occurring.”

Roger Whiteside, the chief executive of Britain’s largest bakery chain, said the company had leased extra warehouse space and this month would begin building additional stocks of ingredients vulnerable to hold-ups at the UK’s ports. Greggs, which opened its 2,000th shop last month, revealed its Brexit plans as it said sales at established stores were up 7.4% in the three months to 28 September, a slowdown from the 10.5% rise in the previous six months. Shares fell 12.6% to £18.26 in the light of the slowdown and Greggs’ announcement that it now expected to open 90 stores for the year, 10 fewer than previously promised. Whiteside said the change was because a number of franchise outlet openings had been delayed until after the next financial year. Whiteside said sales growth was likely to slow against strong trading in the previous financial year, when Greggs benefited from new breakfast ranges and the introduction of its vegan sausage roll in January 2019. But the company is aiming to boost sales by offering evening takeaways. About 60 shops are now open from 6pm to 9pm and that will extend to 250 by the end of the year. Greggs said it still expected to meet profit expectations for the year despite slowing sales growth and rising labour and food costs partly related to Brexit. Whiteside made clear that stockpiling would only help to avert shortages for a few days. “There’s not much we can do. We don’t have long-life items in the way that others do,” he said. “We can’t stockpile fruit and vegetables and salads. Bacon has more [shelf] life so we can hold it for a few days,” he said. Greggs has examined all its recipes and looked at how it might replace delicate ingredients such as lettuce and tomatoes, which are largely imported from Spain over the winter, in the event of any disruption to supply. The company has also begun sourcing all its cheese and most of its sugar in the UK, shifting away from European suppliers, to avoid disruption related to Brexit. The purchase of some delivery lorries has also been brought forward to avoid any potential problems with shipping the vehicles from Europe after the Brexit deadline of 31 October.
100	The relatives of five men summarily executed during the final years of Dutch colonial rule in Indonesia will have their case heard in court after a ground-breaking decision to lift the statute of limitations. The court of appeal in The Hague found there was sufficient evidence that language differences and social disadvantage had stood in the way of claims being made against the state. The relatives – five men and one woman – will have the opportunity to prove they are the children of those executed in 1947. If that is the case, they can claim a reimbursement of the costs of their living. In a sixth case, involving a man tortured by Dutch forces during Indonesia’s struggle for independence after the second world war, compensation for his ordeal was awarded. The victim, who was beaten and had a cigarette stubbed out on his head, was granted €5,000 by the court. Liesbeth Zegveld, the claimants’ lawyer, said: “After 10 years of legal proceedings and given the developments in the debate in our society, it has always surprised me that the state asked a decision of the appeals court. “I’m happy that the court has now issued this principal ruling … My clients are speechless and grateful. This judgment means justice.” The Dutch state had sought for the claims to be struck out given the time that had passed since the acts were committed. But the appeal for limitation was rejected. “The court of appeal is of the opinion that especially the extraordinary seriousness and the high degree of culpability of the violence used stand in the way of limitation,” the judge said. “At the time, the Netherlands failed to register who was shot or abused and when.” The executions carried out by Dutch soldiers took place in 1947 during so-called “cleansing actions” on South Celebes, now called Sulawesi, an island east of Borneo. Japan had occupied the then Dutch colony of the Dutch East Indies during the second world war, but after its capitulation the nationalist leaders Sukarno and Hatta proclaimed the Republic of Indonesia on 17 August 1945. For the following four years, the Netherlands fought to prolong its 350 years of colonial rule of the country, often through barbaric means. Klaas Meijer, a spokesman for the ministry of defence, said the government would study the rulings before deciding its next steps. It could appeal again to higher courts.

102	Benjamin Zephaniah was a schoolboy when he sent a letter to Bob Marley along the lines of: “I’m a poet from Birmingham, nobody’s really listening to me in England, what do you think of my poems?” Incredibly, the reggae star wrote back and told him: “Young man, Britain needs you. Keep doing what you do.” Marley’s handwritten letter from Jamaica was one reason Zephaniah was where he was, he said on Tuesday, as he unveiled an English Heritage blue plaque on the house in Chelsea where the singer lived in 1977. “That was a real inspiration to me,” said Zephaniah. “It really inspired me to keep doing what I was doing … at the time there was no spoken word poetry, there was no dub poetry so to read those words...” The plaque is on the front of 42 Oakley Street, a house where Marley lived with his band the Wailers for a short time in the late 70s. When they were not recording they would make the short trip over the Albert Bridge to play football in Battersea Park. It was while living in Oakley Street that Marley and the Wailers finished recording Exodus, the album which featured Jamming, Three Little Birds, Waiting in Vain and One Love. Zephaniah said he was a fan of Marley when it was not so fashionable. “Certainly the Rastafarian community thought I was a bit soft. They were listening to Burning Spear and all the heavy stuff, but I liked the songs and poetry of Bob Marley. Take away the music and you get poetry.” About 12 blue plaques are unveiled in London by English Heritage every year, celebrating figures from history. Seven doors up from Marley is one marking the Antarctic explorer Robert Falcon Scott. Across the road, at number 87, is a plaque for the Irish nationalist poet Jane Wilde, Oscar’s mother. Other music stars of Marley’s generation with blue plaques include Jimi Hendrix, in Mayfair, John Lennon, in Marylebone, and Freddie Mercury, in Feltham. Only 4% of the 900 plus blue plaques across London are dedicated to black and Asian figures from history. The historian David Olusoga, a trustee of English Heritage and a blue plaques panel member, said the organisation was well aware the figure was “unacceptably low”. He added: “Bob Marley’s plaque is testament to how our scheme is changing, as English heritage continues to work to overcome the obstacles that have led to this underrepresentation.” English Heritage said there were a number of reasons for the low figure, including a low number of nominations and the frequent lack of historic records linking a person to a building in which they lived. Marley is a case in point. His plaque became stuck in the planning process because he was not on the electoral register or in the phone book and getting firm evidence was tricky. Researchers did, however, discover a court record of Marley’s arrest for cannabis possession in 1977, along with bassist Aston ‘Family man’ Barrett. Barrett’s address was 42 Oakley Street while Marley’s was given as 27 Collingham Gardens. Anecdotal evidence has suggested Marley gave a different address to prevent the police from searching the house in Oakley Street for drugs and getting more people in trouble. Olusoga said Marley was one of the most recognisable people to have ever lived. “What mattered to millions of people was not just that he was an undoubted musical genius, but that he was somebody who came from a life like theirs. He had been born into poverty. To millions of people in the developing world he was the first global figure from their background.”
103	We French love to mourn our former presidents. Thousands queued to pay their last respects to Jacques Chirac as he lay in state at the weekend. Monday was a day of national mourning: the tricolour flew at half mast everywhere and a minute’s silence was observed even in schools. It is hard, though, to know which love is greater – the love of mourning the passing of former heads of state, or the love of loathing them with the fervour we held when they were in power. I remember all through the 1970s my mother calling Chirac “facho Chirac” because of his greasy, thinning pulled-back hair, his wannabe Charles de Gaulle style of speaking and his war-like conquest of the right and of Paris city hall. Nevertheless, like millions of others on the left, my mother managed to hold her nose and vote for this “fascist” in the second round of the 2002 presidential elections, when the alternative was Jean-Marie Le Pen. And if she hadn’t already passed away herself, she would have probably shared with me the same strange sentiment which seemed to descend on the French this week: a collective nostalgia, if not sorrow. A poll conducted by the Journal du Dimanche places Chirac as the best French president of the modern era, second only to De Gaulle. How did it come to this? The French have an unusual relationship with power, specifically with our elected presidency. It is, some would say with good reason, a relationship that is borderline pathological. At a time when parliamentary politics is dogged by instability, weak majorities, the decline of the traditional parties and the rise of populist leaders, France’s presidential system appears to be holding up. But it has also infantilised our expectations of politicians. Election after election, we want this president-god to deliver radically better lives, full employment, higher pay and no debt – we want “the butter and the money for the butter” as the saying goes, in other words we want to have our cake and eat it. With every new president, the first political mania that afflicts us is idealisation. We look for a new paradise on Earth to unfold in the first few months, and we are, naturally, barbarously disappointed when it fails to materialise. This leads to the second mania: revolution. A head of state eventually has to face the guillotine. Only after he’s been brought down, can we enter the third phase of our presidential mania: mourning and nostalgia. This is where we are now. It seems remarkable that Chirac can be mourned with such affection when he delivered so little and left office under a cloud of corruption. He was elected on an ambitious goal – to heal la fracture sociale – but he gave up every time he encountered a protest. It is hard to think of a single lasting reform he ever followed through on. He would have almost certainly given into the gilets jaunes much more quickly than Macron did. Chirac’s presidency ran from 1995 to 2007, overlapping with Tony Blair’s decade as British prime minister, and they faced similar global challenges. But the French love affair with Chirac took off precisely because he didn’t do any Blairite-type reforming. He was sticking to big principles on more comfortable ground. The French love that. By opposing the US-UK war in Iraq, his popularity reached its height at the very moment when Blair began to fall from grace in the UK. Seeing four living presidents parade into the eglise Saint-Sulpice for Chirac’s funeral was a reminder of how these individuals have come to embody the political eras they oversaw. Between them – Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, Nicolas Sarkozy, François Hollande and Emmanuel Macron – they have presided over the last 50 years of our political history. We have loved and hated them as almighty president-gods; in our minds they are Shakespearean characters who have acted out decades of political intrigue, power struggle and treason. Giscard, still going at 93, despised Chirac. The feeling was mutual: Chirac hated Giscard so much that he betrayed him by voting for the socialist François Mitterrand over him in 1981. Sarkozy was a Chirac protege who betrayed his mentor in favour of the enemy Édouard Balladur. Hollande was his Socialist party opponent but got on so well with the Conservative Chirac that the latter declared his vote would go to Hollande rather than Sarkozy in 2012. Macron paid a long tribute to his predecessor, but two years into his term, he is struggling for the nation’s affections himself. He may have recovered from the low point of the gilets jaunes protests when he seemed completely out of touch, but he faces more turmoil in the autumn as he tries to push through ambitious social reforms and get his vision for transforming the EU back on track. And in these populist times, with his main opposition coming from the far right, being so identifiably “of the elite”, so young and lacking provincial roots in a country in desperate search of a father figure, is not easy. Macron, Hollande, Sarkozy and Giscard must have all wondered, as they surveyed the congregation, if they would one day be mourned like Chirac. Who knows, but I think what France was mourning this week was not Chirac the man, but rather presidential politics from a simpler era. Chirac was a political chameleon: urbane yet utterly in touch with the grassroots, a culture lover, a womaniser, a bon vivant yet down to earth, dishonest but somehow able to appear uncynical. His puppet on Les Guignols, a satirical TV show, always had the knives of allies who’d betrayed him sticking out of his back, which the nation always found endearing. He could be all things to all voters: a man of the right and a man of the left. He had an instinctive understanding of what motivated ordinary farming people all over his rural Correze constituency. Chirac was the Johnny Hallyday of French politics. Like the singer idolised by the French for generations, he had the style of a cowboy “à l’ancienne”. And just like “Johnny”, he reminded the French of a more innocent era that began with the loosening up of the swinging 1960s: a time of more straightforward politics, without the calculations required for the era of social media and Trump-Johnsonian bombast, or the normalisation of turning “the people” against the political class. It will be impossible for Macron to ever emulate Chirac’s legacy. Chirac governed at a time when a French president, even one who so manifestly failed to give the French the better lives they demanded, could make himself popular without being a populist. • Marion Van Renterghem is a French journalist
104	One of Boris Johnson’s cabinet ministers has revived back-channel discussions with Labour MPs over their potential support for a Brexit deal for the first time since Theresa May’s failed attempts to gain their backing. A government source said exploratory conversations began five to six days ago, including a face-to-face meeting with some Labour representatives of the MPs for a Deal group, which is led by Caroline Flint and Stephen Kinnock. Cabinet ministers in favour of a deal are highly aware that they would almost certainly need more Labour MPs than the five who voted for May’s Brexit agreement last time – Flint, Rosie Cooper, Jim Fitzpatrick, Kevin Barron and John Mann. Boris Johnson insists that he is aiming to win parliamentary support for a new agreement and he will table new proposals to the EU for solving the Irish border issue this week. He would hope to win over the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) and most hardline Eurosceptics, but he would still need the support of Labour MPs unless there were fewer than six unsupportive Tory Brexiters. However, the prime minister has put little to no effort into gaining the backing of Labour MPs, many of whom were outraged by his response to their concerns that inflammatory language about Brexit is contributing to death threats against those blocking no deal. A Labour MP confirmed the meeting with a senior cabinet minister had taken place but described the conversation as “circular”. There was no indication whether the government is prepared to offer any concessions that would be necessary for them to back a deal, such as the tabling of the withdrawal agreement bill rather than a simple meaningful vote, greater protections for workers’ rights and the environment, and a vote on any future trade deal. Three cabinet sources have said that No 10 was focused on forcing a moment in parliament where MPs were obliged to make a decision between a deal and no deal, in spite of the Benn legislation blocking a no-deal Brexit. This could mean trying to persuade the EU to offer a deal on a take it or leave it basis with no possibility of an extension if this is rejected by parliament. Damian Green, May’s former deputy, told BBC Radio 5 Live on Tuesday that he found it “hard to believe” that MPs would reject a deal if Johnson managed to secure one. Green, who is chair of the One Nation group of Conservative MPs, said he believes the pressure on MPs to accept a deal will be “much greater even than it was when Theresa May was putting her deal to the House of Commons”. “If we can get a deal with the European Union, and that’s still a big if, if we can do that, I find it hard to believe that the House of Commons would reject it again,” he said. “If we can get a deal, then the external pressure on parliament will be much greater even than it was when Theresa May was putting her deal to the House of Commons. “Assuming that we get some kind of arrangement that’s not the backstop, which seems to be what lies behind the British government’s latest proposals this morning, then that will make it more palatable, certainly to a lot of my colleagues on the Conservative side, and there is this group formed, MPs for a Deal, which contains a lot of prominent Labour MPs.” • This article was amended on 2 October 2019 to remove an incorrect reference to John Mann being an independent MP. He has been nominated as a non-affiliated life peer but will remain a Labour MP until either the next general election or when he is elevated to the House of Lords. He says he will continue to be a Labour party member.
105	Elaine Feinstein, who has died aged 88, was a leading poet and the bringer of a new internationalism to British verse. As a novelist, she was one of the women who transformed literary writing in the 1970s. In 1961 she published the first translations into English of works by Marina Tsvetaeva, and went on to produce a biography of the great Russian poet’s tragic life, A Captive Lion (1987). Elaine’s lifelong advocacy of Russian poetry continued with the biographies Pushkin (1998) and Anna of All the Russias (2005), about Anna Akhmatova, and with translations of contemporary Russian women poets. In 2008 she revealed the imaginative hinterland to this work in The Russian Jerusalem, a novel that mixes poetry and prose to trace Soviet persecution of the poets she called the “Jews” of Russian culture. The poetry for which she created an English-speaking audience deeply influenced her own. Driven by cultural curiosity, she also helped bring very different, North American traditions of black mountain and beat poetry to Britain. In 1959 she founded Prospect magazine (unrelated to the current journal of that name), publishing Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso and, among others, Charles Olson, whose Letter to Elaine Feinstein remains today a much anthologised projectivist text. Though projectivism, taking a breath as the poetic unit, may now be consigned to literary history, Prospect’s transatlantic cultural exchange helped create today’s Anglo-American Cambridge school of poetry, with JH Prynne at its centre. But it is the clear-sighted and profoundly emotionally intelligent character of Elaine’s own verse that has influenced many poets working in English today, as well as delighting readers and audiences around the world: she was a charismatic performer. Ted Hughes wrote that her poetry “follows the track of the nerves”, while George Steiner described it as “instinct with caring, with a rare intelligence of pain”. More than a dozen poetry collections followed her debut, In a Green Eye (1966), including Talking to the Dead (2007) – elegies of meditative intimacy for her husband, the molecular biologist Arnold Feinstein, who died in 2002 – and the themed studies Cities (2010) and Portraits (2015). They culminate in her last published volume, the new and selected poems of The Clinic, Memory (2017). As a poet, Elaine’s voice is unique. In prose, she was one of a generation of women, among them Angela Carter, Eva Figes and Elaine’s close friend Emma Tennant, who transformed British reading and publishing in the 70s. Elaine’s psychologically exploratory fiction often centred on women’s lives. Her first novel, The Circle, appeared in 1970, the year that also saw the publication of Germaine Greer’s The Female Eunuch and Kate Millett’s Sexual Politics – these were the books that fuelled a zeitgeist. Short stories, radio and TV drama, followed, as well as 13 further novels including The Glass Alembic (1973), which established her reputation on both sides of the Atlantic, and Mother’s Girl (1988). Further biographies, criticism and edited volumes also followed, as did an autobiography. It Goes With the Territory (2013) is subtitled Memoirs of a Poet, and Elaine’s career was exemplary, not only in the lasting significance of her work but in the range and depth of her literary friendships. Yet she was unafraid to acknowledge the “three strikes” that her times could hold against her, as a Jewish woman from the north of England. Born in Bootle, Merseyside, she was the only child of Isadore Cooklin and Fay (nee Compton), and grew up in Leicester, where her father was a cabinet maker. But she never forgot that all four of her grandparents had been born in Odessa, now in Ukraine. From Wyggeston grammar school for girls, in 1949 she went to Newnham College, Cambridge, as an exhibitioner to study English. Wartime adolescence – which had to assimilate the revelations of the Nazi death camps – was now replaced by the excitement of being among only the second intake of women allowed to join the university. She studied for the bar after graduating, but decided not to practise. In 1956 she married Arnold and moved back to Cambridge, where their three sons were born and their home became a meeting place for visiting writers from around the world, among them Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Miroslav Holub and Yehuda Amichai. Elaine worked at Cambridge University Press (1959-62), at Hockerill teacher training college (1963-66) and then in Donald Davie’s new comparative literature department at the University of Essex till 1970, when she left to become a full-time writer. She revised her Tsvetaeva translations (1971), produced her translations of Three Russian Poets (1976), and received three Arts Council awards for translation. She began to write for the Guardian, the Times and the New York Review of Books. In 1973 both Elaine’s parents died, and her work turned towards conscious exploration of Jewish identity and central European tradition. The novels The Survivors (1982) and The Border (1984) tell stories of Holocaust survival. Related themes thread the poetry collections of the 80s and 90s, though often tangentially. The writing life also remained an enduring theme: biographies of Hughes and DH Lawrence were followed by Gold (2000), a verse portrait of Mozart’s Jewish librettist, Lorenzo da Ponte. Elaine became a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (1981) and received a Civil List pension (2005). She was widely translated and travelled with zest, with literary fellowships for the British Council in Norway and Singapore, and, always collegiate, serving on prize juries. The compassionate, wry, and often very funny understanding of human nature that characterises her writing also gave Elaine a great gift for loving friendship and family life. She is survived by her sons Adam, Martin and Joel, and grandchildren Lara, Katriona, Johnny, Natasha, Zack and Alicia. • Elaine Barbara Feinstein, poet and writer, born 24 October 1930; died 23 September 2019 • This piece was amended on 3 October 2019 to correct the name of the Russian poet Marina Tsvetaeva
106	Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is on seven different types of medication. He has a rare condition that causes him to cackle uncontrollably and carries a card that reads “Forgive my laughter”. Fleck dreams of being a successful standup comedian but earns minimum wage as a pathetic party clown named Carnival. He is sad, single and living in a cruddy apartment with his ageing mother Penny (Frances Conroy). No wonder, then, that since its premiere at the Venice international film festival in August, Phoenix’s anarchic, ultraviolent Joker has been understood as a kind of stand-in for basement-dwelling incels-turned-mass shooters, and the film itself a timely evocation of a tense, Trumpian cultural moment. The film grasps for ways to cheekily telegraph its relevance. Fleck’s mother is hinted to be the victim of a #MeToo-esque scandal involving Bruce Wayne’s father; a TV clip of a shooting goes “viral”. A scene that sees Joker woozily pirouetting down a flight of steps in a three-piece suit is played for maximum swag – and set to the sounds of Rock and Roll Part 2, the 1972 track from convicted paedophile Gary Glitter. Fleck accidentally becomes a vigilante symbol when he is spotted gunning down three bankers on the subway, face painted like a mournful jester. This sparks a wave of Occupy-style protests across the film’s early-80s Gotham City. Except that Phillips and Silver are only interested in the imagery of revolt, not its ideas. An angry mob is both generic and a shorthand; upon closer inspection, Charlie Hebdo-ish protest signs are so banal they might as well read: “Je suis Carnival”. Lest viewers underestimate the profundity of what’s on show, Hildur Guðnadóttir’s thundering cello score is there to remind them. Fleck is bemused by the kerfuffle, insisting that he is “not political”, and there’s something in the idea that public figures are easily co-opted by the violent far right. Still, the film isn’t daring enough to pass as truly nihilistic. Writers Todd Phillips and Scott Silver buffer Fleck from identification with white supremacy by giving him a crush on his African American neighbour (Zazie Beetz). It is a sign, perhaps, that there is a concern about alienating certain ticket-buying audiences. Joker does not invite ambivalence. When the character refrains from sharing a joke with a psychiatrist, it is because she “wouldn’t get it”. The film is awfully pleased with itself; Phoenix’s twisted smile is less the iconic, toothy grin associated with the title character, more a smug, self-satisfied smirk.
107	Comedy is dying and political correctness is killing it. Nobody can joke about anything any more without triggered liberals screaming “racism” and “cancelling” them. I’ll stop there because I’m sure you have heard this screed before. Conservatives love complaining about how millennial snowflakes can’t take a joke and don’t understand “edgy” humour. In September, for example, the comedian Shane Gillis was dropped from Saturday Night Live after footage surfaced of him making racist, homophobic and misogynistic gags. Gillis responded to the outrage with a non-apology in which he explained that he “pushes boundaries” and takes risks. Comedians should obviously push boundaries and take risks. But punching down has never been remotely risky or funny. This isn’t a development of our “woke” era; it’s a principle the world’s best comics have always acknowledged. Just look at the 30-year-old video of George Carlin that recently went viral. In the clip Carlin criticises bigoted jokes made by his fellow standup Andrew Dice Clay. “Comedy has traditionally picked on people in power,” Carlin says. “Women and gays and immigrants, to my way of thinking, are underdogs.” He adds: “I think [Clay’s] core audience is young, white males who are threatened by these groups.” Around the same time that Carlin’s comments were going viral, the New York Times published a new interview with Eddie Murphy, who is returning to standup. Murphy, 58, told the Times he isn’t afraid of current controversies over humour, pointing out that he was picketed for homophobic jokes he made in the 1980s. It took Murphy a long time to apologise for those jokes and the backlash was partly why he stopped doing standup for years. But you know what? He still has a career. What’s more, he says he cringes when he thinks of his old, “ignorant” material. So there you are: Murphy is living proof that political correctness hasn’t killed comedy. He shows that it’s perfectly possible to apologise and evolve, even if it takes a while. I hope Gillis is paying attention.
108	We will now bring our coverage of today’s events in Hong Kong to a close, as protests and riots go on into the night. Hong Kong police shot an 18-year-old protester with live ammunition, marking a major escalation in the use of force against demonstrators. Protests called to mark a “national day of grief” saw tens of thousands of people demonstrate across the city in defiance of a ban on the protests in what was the most widespread show of public anger towards Beijing yet. 51 people – aged 11 to 75 – were confirmed to have been injured during the protests, as of 8pm local time. Two were in a critical condition while another two are in a serious condition, according to the Hospital Authority Authorities confirmed that one of the critically injured was in Queen Elizabeth hospital, after reports said the 18-year-old who was shot had been transferred there. Protesters staged pitched battles with police as the demonstrations descended into riots in places, with government buildings stormed and businesses perceived to be pro-Beijing targeted. Protesters were ordered to leave the legislative council complex, though it remained unclear what happened inside the building. The UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab said the use of live ammunition was disproportionate, and joined the EU in calling for de-escalation. Hong Kong police have previously caused severe injuries with rubber bullets and beanbag rounds, including to the eyes of a protestor and a journalist. However until today, they had only fired live rounds in warning. The protests came as China celebrated 70 years of Communist party rule with a triumphalist military parade. Here is our latest report from Hong Kong. Thanks for joining us. The Legislative Council secretariat has now lifted the red alert that it issued earlier (see 10.41am). It is unclear exactly what happened but it is clear that protesters entered the building. In July, hundreds of protesters broke into Hong Kong’s legislature and sprayed graffiti on the walls. The UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab has said that the use of live ammunition by Hong Kong police was disproportionate after a teenage demonstrator was shot. He said in a statement: Whilst there is no excuse for violence, the use of live ammunition is disproportionate, and only risks inflaming the situation. This incident underlines the need for a constructive dialogue to address the legitimate concerns of the people of Hong Kong. We need to see restraint and a de-escalation from both protesters and the Hong Kong authorities. Just over a kilometre away from Sham Shui Po, several more rounds of tear gas have been shot in Mongkok, near the Prince Edward station. The area in the vicinity of the station has been the flash point of protests over the past month due to a rumour that people died during a police attack on protesters on August 31. People shouted the popular slogan “Reclaim Hong Kong! Revolution of our era!” as tear gas was fired, before they opened umbrellas behind a make shift barricade and retreated. Someone threw a petrol bomb as protesters formed a defence line. “Hong Kongers, go!” they shouted, before another round of tear gas was fired. The Hong Kong police force have issued a new statement condemning the ongoing rioting across the semi-autonomous state. Rioters continue to damage public properties and buildings extensively across Kowloon, Hong Kong Island and the New Territories. This poses a serious threat to public peace and order. Rioters have damaged the government offices in multiple districts, smashing up glass panes and facilities. Another group of rioters have stormed various MTR stations and damaged facilities therein. Rioters even hurled numerous petrol bombs into train compartments in Tsuen Wan MTR station, and onto platforms in Tai Wai MTR station. Such acts seriously disrupt railway system. Some rioters attempted to burn light poles and ATMs, seriously endangering public order. Appallingly, some rioters beat up bystanders in different districts, taking the law into their own hands. The police warn all rioters to stop all illegal acts and express the strongest condemnation against all violent acts of rioters. The police are conducting dispersal and arrest operations in various districts in Hong Kong. Due to the dangerous situation, the Police appeal to all members of the public to stay in safe places and stay tuned to the latest situation. UK-based charity Hong Kong Watch have condemned the shooting earlier as an “appalling escalation of police brutality” and highlighted how journalists have been intimidated. It also called on the UK government to consider measures to defend the rights of people in Hong Kong. It said in a statement: On 1 October 2019, a police officer fired a live round at a protestor at close range, leaving the young man in a critical condition. This is an appalling escalation of police brutality which demands a robust response from the British government and the wider international community. There were widespread protests across Hong Kong on Tuesday, as the as the Chinese Communist Party marked the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the People’s Republic of China, with confrontations taking place across the city between protestors and the Hong Kong police. During one of these confrontations, a police officer shot the young Form Five student from point blank range with a live bullet. Although Hong Kong Watch does not support or condone the violence of a minority of protestors in these confrontations, the police response was grossly disproportionate. This incident is part of a wider cycle of police brutality. A recent Amnesty International report confirms “an alarming pattern of the Hong Kong Police Force deploying reckless and indiscriminate tactics” in their arrests, as well as beating and torturing people in detention. The intimidation of the press in recent weeks is also unacceptable. A journalist for an Indonesian-language publication was recently shot with a rubber bullet, despite the journalist not being in the vicinity of protestors and being clearly identifiable as a member of the press. The Foreign Correspondent’s Club report that over the weekend journalists were hit by tear gas canisters and rubber bullets, targeted with pepper spray, verbally threatened by the police, and blocked from documenting the arrests of protestors. Hong Kong Watch calls on the United Kingdom government to consider measures which can be taken to defend the rights and freedoms of people in Hong Kong. The integrity of the Sino-British Joint Declaration is gravely threatened, and the government should consider every available means to stand with people in Hong Kong. This should include extending the rights of BNO passport holders; extending Magnitsky sanctions to officials who have committed abuses of human rights; and establishing a ‘contact group’ at the United Nations of like-minded countries to act collectively to defend the rights and freedoms of Hong Kongers. The protests have endured in Sham Shui Po, where a banner reading “When dictatorship is a fact, revolution becomes a duty” lays across the street. Nearby, fireworks are let off into the air by protesters saying this is “the true National Day for Hongkongers.” The government information service has told the Guardian that 51 people – aged 11 to 75 – have been injured today during the protests, as of 8pm local time. Two are in a critical condition while another two are in a serious condition, according to the Hospital Authority. It confirmed that one of the critically injured was in Queen Elizabeth hospital, after reports said the 18-year-old who was shot had been transferred there. The latest photos we have as the demonstrations and disorder go on into the night. As celebrations marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Communist party go on into the night, pro-Beijing politician Junius Ho Kwan-yiu – who is currently in the Chinese capital – has called for emergency laws to restore order in Hong Kong. In a statement carried by SCMP, he said: It is the National Day of the People’s Republic of China today. All Chinese and decent people are supposed to be celebrating this great day and the great achievements of our motherland joyously together. I am terribly saddened by all the riotous events that have happened at various places in Hong Kong today. Police were attacked and forced to defend themselves with side arms. My office was damaged by mobsters for the third time. It is already clear that such a trend of violence is escalating and damages to the district offices of several of my colleagues have also been inflicted. It seems there is no sign of this coming to an end until the government is determined to clamp down and call for emergency measures under Cap 241 - the Emergency Regulations Ordinance. I hereby urge our [chief executive] to take prompt action to introduce all necessary means to restore law and order, and hence peace in Hong Kong. BuzzFeed journalist Rosalind Adams has tweeted about the intimidation she was subject to while she was reporting earlier. The number of people admitted to hospital is rising and there are now 31 confirmed injured, including two men in critical conditions and one in a serious condition, the SCMP quoted the Hospital Authority as saying. There are reports of a hit and run in Sham Shui Po, amid ongoing attempts to disperse protesters from outside a police station. Photos circulating show paramedics attending to somebody who was apparently hit by a taxi. As protests go on into the night, police senior superintendent Yolanda Yu Hoi-kwan has said the officer that shot an 18-year-old man with a live round did so because he “felt his life was under serious threat”. She said in a video posted on Facebook: At about 4pm, a large group of rioters attacked police officers near Tai Ho Road, and they continued with their attack after officers warned them to stop. As an officer felt his life was under serious threat, he fired a round at the assailant to save his own life and his colleagues’ lives. The round hit an 18-year-old, and the area near his left shoulder was injured, and he was conscious when taken to Princess Margaret Hospital. The police force really did not want to see anyone being injured, so we feel very sad about this. We warn rioters to stop breaking the law immediately, as we will strictly enforce the law. However, Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor director Law Yuk-kai has said the officer acted inappropriately. “The officer should de-escalate the tension instead of raising the danger level,” he told the SCMP. “Now he is blaming his wrong judgment on others to legitimise [the shooting].” As it approaches 8pm local time, fires have been lit in the streets in Tuen Mun, an out-of-town western district where protesters have been heard shouting: “Reclaim Hong Kong! Revolution of our era”. Elsewhere, in Fortress Hill, buses are being searched The fire service have put out a fire at Tai Wai metro station, before protesters trashed the building. In their first statement in four hours, the Hong Kong police force have advised the public to not go outside due to rioting. A British politician, the Liberal Democrat chief whip Alistair Carmichael, has urged the UK government to not “stand silently by” after the shooting of a protester by police today. It is absolutely heart-breaking and unacceptable that a protestor has been shot while calling for their democratic rights and freedoms. The situation is abhorrent. The UK government must not stand silently by and let this happen. We have a moral and legal duty to the people of Hong Kong. The Chinese government have clearly reneged on the Joint Sino-British Declaration: there is absolutely no denying that. Liberal Democrats will continue to demand that the Conservative government hold the Chinese government to account on the promises made during the handover, bring an end to these repressive scenes, and secure an independent investigation into the violence in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, the European Union has called for de-escalation and restraint. “In light of the continuing unrest and violence in Hong Kong, the European Union continues to stress that dialogue, de-escalation and restraint are the only way forward,” EU spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic told reporters. More than one-third of the MTR’s 91 stations have now reportedly been closed, after Long Ping station was confirmed to have shut, as the intensifying protests bring Hong Kong ever closer to a standstill. In a statement, the Transport department said that the MTR train service has been adjusted “due to public activities”. It confirmed Long Ping station was closed and trains would not stop at that station “Train service on Ma On Shan Line and Tsuen Wan Line is suspended,” the statement read. “Prince Edward to Yau Ma Tei, HKU, Sai Ying Pun, Central to Causeway Bay, Diamond Hill to Lok Fu, Tai Wai, Sha Tin, East Tsim Sha Tsui, Tsuen Wan West, Yuen Long, Siu Hong and Tuen Mun stations are closed and trains will not stop at these stations.” Public broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong has withdrawn all of its reporters from the ground after one of its journalists was hit in the head by a projectile. RTHK reported: The male reporter suffered a wound above his right eye and was treated by first aiders before being helped to an ambulance to be taken to hospital. He had been covering the protest in the Sham Shui Po area throughout the afternoon, which included a government building getting vandalised and attempts to throw Molotov cocktails at the area’s police station. The journalist said he wasn’t sure what struck him. Earlier in the day, a female reporter from the station said a riot police officer had pointed a shotgun right at her at the intersection of Queensway and Queens Road East. With journalists from other media outlets also getting splashed by a corrosive liquid while covering the clashes, RTHK’s English News And Current Affairs unit decided it was no longer safe for its reporters to be on the streets during the National Day protests. Further reporting on the day’s events was being carried out from the station’s newsrooms. Fires are being lit in the streets at Causeway Bay on Hong Kong Island as a water cannon truck approaches. amid a standoff between protesters and police. The SCMP reports that it has been told at least 30 protesters have been arrested on Hong Kong Island so far today. Two videos posted online appear to depict the shooting and its aftermath in Tsuen Wan. AFP have described the events: Some half a dozen riot police can be seen clashing with around 12 masked protesters, some of whom were using umbrellas and metal poles to strike the officers. One officer runs into frame with his sidearm drawn.He kicks a protester before firing at near point black range into the chest of a protester with a metal pole in his hand. An gunshot can be heard as the pistol rears upwards. The protester stumbles backwards and then falls over a police officer who has been knocked to the ground as the rest of the demonstrators run away. A second video, filmed by Hong Kong University’s Campus TV, showed the same incident from a different angle. Footage filmed shortly afterwards by local broadcaster Stand News showed police officers treating the prone man who had an oxygen mask on his face and his t-shirt cut open, traces of blood on his chest. Paramedics later arrived on scene and placed the man, who was conscious, on to a stretcher. Police are now charging at protesters in Wong Tai Sin district after businesses were vandalised. The SCMP reports that the protester shot earlier was a form five student, suggesting he is no older than 18. He is being transferred to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Yau Ma Tei, which has the nearest cardiothoracic surgery centre, a source told the paper. Hong Kong police have said a pro-democracy protester was shot in the chest by officer during clashes today, the Associated Press report. A police source separately told AFP: “An officer discharged his firearm after coming under attack and a protester was struck in the chest in Tsuen Wan district today.” The wounded protester received initial first aid from officers before paramedics arrived and took him to hospital, according to the source. There are tense scenes in Hennessy Road as police deploy water cannons and make arrests. This is the latest from Reuters: Hong Kong police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at pro-democracy protesters throwing petrol bombs in the Asian financial hub on Tuesday as its Chinese rulers celebrated the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic. Cat-and-mouse clashes spread from the upmarket district of Causeway Bay to the Admiralty area of government offices on Hong Kong island. Violence also spread across the harbour to Kowloon and beyond to the New Territories in the most widespread unrest in nearly four months. The South China Morning Post and television reports said at least one person was wounded in the chest by police firing live rounds. Police did not respond to requests for comment but have said they fired live rounds into the air in previous clashes. Fifteen people were wounded, one critically, the Hospital Authority said without giving details. Police fired water cannon and volley after volley of tear gas to disperse protesters throwing Molotov cocktails outside central government offices in the Admiralty area and ordered the evacuation of the Legislative Council building next door. Police said “rioters” had used corrosive fluid in Tuen Mun in the west of the New Territories, “injuring multiple police officers and reporters”. No details were immediately available. SCMP’s Rachel Cheung reports that a protester has been hit by a car in an apparent hit and run. Police have used tear gas to disperse protesters who were digging up the Tuen Mun light rail tram tracks, in an out-of-town district in the New Territories. They are now retreating after police charged at them from two directions amid the sound of gun shots, as protesters threw objects back at police. Elsewhere, in Shatin, police have fired tear gas and charged at protesters who set fires alight fires on a main street. The Hospital Authority has told South China Morning Post that 15 people have been injured today, including one who is in a critical condition at Princess Margaret Hospital. The newspaper now appears to have confirmed a man was shot earlier, and have quoted a friend saying they were in a critical condition. SCMP report that two lawyers have arrived at the hospital to offer legal counsel to the man who was shot in the chest. His family arrived shortly after, and were escorted by lawyers to consult doctors about his condition A video is circulating which appears to show a man being shot at extremely short range. The Hong Kong government has demanded people leave the legislative council complex immediately. “The Legislative Council (“LegCo”) Secretariat issued a Red alert at 3:55 pm today (1 October),” it said in a statement. “All persons are required to evacuate the LegCo Complex immediately under safe circumstances.” Earlier, police backed by a water cannon truck which deployed blue dye outside the government’s headquarters attempted to prevent protesters advancing to Beijing’s liaison office after they threw molotov cocktails. It followed reports that protesters were working to unlock doors believed to lead into the legislative council complex. Quartz’s Mary Hui is on the ground in Wanchai, where protesters are dispersing after riot police moved in. Labour party legislative council member Fernando Cheung is followed and pushed by police in Admiralty. The latest photos we have from Hong Kong. In a major escalation in their use of force, police appear to have hit a protestor with a live round for the first time. The protestor was injured in the chest; video shared by local Standnews website apparently showed him begging for medical help as he bled on the street. “Send me to hospital, my chest is hurting. I need to go to hospital”. Hong Kong police have previously caused severe injuries with rubber bullets and beanbag rounds, including to the eyes of a protestor and a journalist. However until today, they had only fired live rounds in warning. The police have been criticised by Amnesty International for excessive use of force on protestors Reports of the number of live rounds fired today have grown to five, as details of the shootings emerge. Clearly, we are seeing an escalation of both the protesters’ methods and the police response. Separately, a video is circulating which shows a woman being slapped as she is held to the ground by police. Crowds have fallen silent at Admiralty, after reports that a protester was shot with a live round. The South China Morning Press has quoted an unnamed source who said a man was shot in the chest by a live round fired by police on Hoi Pa Street, Tsuen Wan. Photos circulated online show officers and first aiders attending to him. The South China Morning Post reports that at least two warning shots were fired by police on Sha Tsui Road in Tsuen Wan and Yau Ma Tei, outside Kwong Wah Hospital. Dozens of police have formed a security ring, backed by a water cannon truck deployed with blue dye, a round outside the government’s headquarters, to prevent protesters from advancing after they threw molotov cocktails. Protesters have torn down a national day banner and set it on fire as tension rises in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Free Press has reported that protesters are working to unlock doors which are believed to lead into the legislative council complex and government headquarters, after they were forced out on Sunday. This is the latest from the Associated Press:: Riot police have fired tear gas to disperse pro-democracy protesters in several districts in Hong Kong amid multiple rallies challenging the Chinese Communist Party as it marks its 70th year of rule. Dozens of police officers formed a security cordon, backed by a water cannon truck, to prevent protesters from advancing to Beijing’s liaison office in the city. Battles between hundreds of black-clad protesters and police occurred in multiple locations, turning streets into battlefields. Police fired multiple rounds of tear gas at the Wong Tai Sin, Sha Tin, Tsuen Wan and Tuen Mun areas as protesters hurled gas bombs, bricks and other objects in their direction. Police said protesters used corrosive fluid in Tuen Mun, injuring officers and some reporters. The city was already under tight security, and more subway stations were shuttered as the violence spread. Earlier, protesters paved the streets of central Hong Kong with fake bank notes they usually use at funerals, tossing wads of them into the air as they marched in black. The notes, many marked “Hell Bank Note,” were a vivid expression of what many protesters say feels like a day of mourning for them as Communist leaders in Beijing celebrate 70 years in power. Like outsized confetti, tens of thousands of the notes covered a broad thoroughfare where a vast and swelling crowd tens of thousands strong marched, shouting “Fight for freedom.” Protesters brought shopping bags full of giant wads of the notes and passed them out in the crowd. Marcher Ray Luk said as he and his mother tossed notes into the air, “The leaders who won’t listen to our voice, this is for them.” In the crowd, a protester also blew a bamboo trumpet traditionally heard at funerals and weddings, leading the crowd as it sang “Glory to Hong Kong,” an anthem of the protests. Around 3pm, protesters found that some riot police were hiding inside the closed Wanchai metro station and started throwing objects into the station. People jeered at riot police who occupied the footbridge outside the police headquarters. Protesters spray painted slogans on tram stops, along with shops perceived as pro-Beijing. There are 18 metro stations now closed, according to reports. Reporting for the Guardian, Verna Yu has been speaking with protesters on Hong Kong island, the site of the main protest. “It’s national day but there’s nothing to be happy about in HK,” says a 17-year-old protester. “We’re under one party rule and the Communist party controls our government. They suppress all opposition voices.” Elsewhere, in Tuen Mun, police have been attacked by demonstrators. Police have issued a statement condemning the violence. “Rioters have used corrosive fluid in Tuen Mun area, injuring multiple police officers and reporters.” Nearby, police have fired tear gas after protesters threw petrol bombs, according to the South China Morning Press. Hello everyone, this is Mattha Busby picking up the blog from my colleagues Martin Farrer and Naaman Zhou in Australia, on the 70th anniversary of Communist China’s founding. It is just after 3pm local time in Hong Kong, where thousands of protesters have been marking the “Day of Grief” in defiance of a police ban. Officers have fired tear gas and used “appropriate force” to disperse demonstrators on Lung Cheung Road in Wong Tai Sin, and people have been warned to leave the sites of protests “to leave the scene as soon as possible”. This is from AFP: Police fanned out across Hong Kong on Tuesday in a bid to deter pro-democracy protests as the city marked communist China’s 70th birthday, with local officials watching a flag-raising ceremony behind closed doors because of security concerns. Authorities ramped up security checks ahead of the anniversary and announced the closure of more than a dozen subway stations as officers conducted stop and searches in the streets and on public transport. The international finance hub is on edge as protesters vow to overshadow Beijing’s festivities, stepping up their nearly four months of protests pushing for greater democratic freedoms and police accountability. Sunday witnessed some of the most sustained clashes in weeks between police and hardcore protesters. Activists have called for people to hit the streets for a “Day of Grief” - although police banned a proposed rally through the city. In a vivid illustration of the political insecurity now coursing through Hong Kong, city officials watched a morning harbourside flag-raising ceremony from the safety of the nearby convention centre. Since Hong Kong’s 1997 handover to China by Britain, officials had always attended the ceremony outside, even during torrential downpours. But popular protests that erupted in June have made it increasingly risky for officials to appear in public. We are going to pause our live coverage for the time being. You can read our wrap of the news from a momentous day in Beijing and Hong Kong here: While Beijing celebrated, Hong Kong mourns: Here are some scenes from the streets of Hong Kong: One feature of the protests is that many people are stretching out five fingers to symbolise their five key demands. These are: The complete withdrawal of the proposed extradition bill The government to withdraw the use of the word “riot” in relation to protests The unconditional release of arrested protesters and charges against them dropped An independent inquiry into police behaviour Implementation of genuine universal suffrage Protester James Ma added that “they didn’t listen to us when we were peaceful”. He added that the arrests of a number of people, including well known activists and ordinary protesters on the eve of the protest today, came after leader Carrie Lam’s first community dialogues which promised to listen to ordinary people’s voices. And talking of Carrie Lam, she’s looking quite happy to be out of Hong Kong and in Beijing for the big celebration:look who’s smiling now: Verna has been speaking to marchers in Causeway Bay. They say they are not afraid, even though the government banned the protest and pulled out all the stops to prevent people from turning up. These tactics included closing metro stations, blocking roads and diverting buses. A protester who identified himself as James Ma, said: “The more they crackdown, the more we need to come out because it’s our freedom to protest.” Asked whether he was worried about being arrested for the unsanctioned protest, he said he was not afraid: “Hong Kong people will not be defeated.” Hello everyone. I’m Martin Farrer taking over from Naaman Zhou. The Causeway Bay protest is a lively gathering. Our reporter on the scene, Verna Yu, says there are thousands of people in attendance, many of them dressed in black. They are shouting slogans including “Fight for freedom, Stand with Hong Kong” and “No rioters, only violent regimes”. Many are also sporting the Guy Fawkes-style masks popularised during the Occupy protests a few years back. Reuters reports that Taiwan’s government has condemned China’s “dictatorship”, saying the country was a threat to peace and trying to find excuses for its military expansion: Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council, responding to the parade and Xi’s comments, said Taiwan would never accept “one country, two systems”, the model of supposedly high autonomy Hong Kong and Macau have, which Beijing sees as eventually being the best way to win Taiwan over. “The Chinese Communist Party has persisted with its one-party dictatorship for 70 years, a concept of governance that violates the values **of democracy, freedom and human rights, causing risks and challenges for the development of mainland China,” it said. “Its shouting about the struggle for unity, great rejuvenation and unification is only an excuse for military expansion, seriously threatening regional peace and world democracy and civilisation.” Taiwan has been democratic for more than 30 years, and China should use this moment to reflect and push for democracy, it added. “The lifeline of the survival and development of mainland China is not tied to one person and one party,” the council said. The South China Morning Post are reporting that an unapproved rally in Sham Shui Po has been closed due to government sign declaring a “special incident”. With that, I will be handing over the blog to my colleague Martin Farrer. Protests and parades have marked China’s 70th anniversary of Communist party rule. In Beijing, president Xi Jinping declared “No force can shake this great nation”, amidst the protests in Hong Kong and a trade war with the US. Xi said he was committed to “peaceful reunification and one country, two systems” for Hong Kong and Macau, and “peace” and “reunification” with Taiwan. A huge military parade showcased new weapons technology – including nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles and supersonic drones. In Hong Kong, protestors gathered for marches planned for this afternoon. Activists also staged a demonstration in the morning, even as streets and subway stations were closed. Hundreds have gathered in the city despite some protests being banned by police. Activist Joshua Wong called on the world to use the day to “fight against authoritarianism” and pressure governments and companies to reconsider their relationship with China. Protesters are gathering in a range of places across the city – not just Causeway Bay. There are 100 at the Southorn Playground in Wan Chai, as estimated by the South China Morning Post. Others are gathering in Wong Tai Sin Square. And at the Sha Tsui Playground in Tsuen Wan, there is an authorised rally planned for 1pm local time. Large crowds are gathering in Causeway Bay, fingers outstretched to represent the five core demands of protesters. And here’s a sign from earlier today at a separate protest outside the British consulate. Around the city, riot police are also gathering. The focus now turns to Hong Kong, where multiple pro-democracy protests are planned across the city this afternoon. The parade is now over, bringing an end to nearly three hours of speeches and military procession. There was also a robot in the parade. This float represented Liaoning province, known for its industry. In Hong Kong, protesters gather for one of the marches. This one is scheduled to start at 1pm local time – which is in 20 minutes. Back in Beijing a float representing Hong Kong and Macau has rolled through, with the sign “Hong Kong will have a better tomorrow”. Inside an empty mall in Hong Kong. Overnight, Reuters in Hong Kong reported that there was a contingent of China’s People Armed Police (PAP) in the city for the first time. Last month, China had moved troops into the city as part of what was said to be a routine rotation. Sources told Reuters that this included PAP, which had not been reported at the time, in their first significant entry into Hong Kong. In Beijing, a tribute now to the 2008 Beijing Olympics. There is a protest march planned for Hong Kong today, from Causeway Bay to Central. It has been banned by police, but many say they will march anyway. Crowds have begun gathering near the Sogo department store ahead of the demonstration. Protesters in Hong Kong have hung this banner up outside the British consulate. “Not my national day”, it says. “Proud to be British since 1841” The civilian portion of the parade is well underway. A float with a portrait of Mao Zedong and other monuments roll through the square. The military procession is now over. A huge choir takes over, singing in Tiananmen Square. Marchers are now carrying a giant Chinese flag, and bouquets of flowers. As the military parade continues in Beijing, Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong is tweeting and calling on the world to “fight against authoritarianism”. “No celebration,” he writes. “Only demonstration” “Using Hong Kong as a stepping stone, China is waving its claws at the free world...We, Hongkongers, are fighting not only for ourselves, but also for you and your country to safeguard the core values of the free world. He says to the world: “Reconsider your government’s China-related policies and Chinese business involvement. Call on your government to exert diplomatic pressure on Beijing.” In Hong Kong, Verna Yu reports: Hong Kong police have arrested a number of people ahead of the protest this afternoon. A protester told the Guardian that four people he knew were arrested from their homes this morning. Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) reported, citing police sources, that five people, including two students, were arrested late Monday night on suspicion of conspiracy to make offensive weapons. Police said they seized materials that can be used to make petrol bombs including thinner, naphtha, magnesium and aluminium powder, as well as glass bottles. Long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles, and nuclear missiles, are now rolling across Tiananmen Square. Now, the first public appearance of a new inter-continental ballistic missile, the DF-17. State TV commentators say it has “small to medium range” capacity. Other missiles follow, capable of nuclear and conventional warheads, state media says. The drone team is now out. We are up to three different formations, large and small, mounted on the back of trucks. Before that were telecommunications vehicles. A slightly more complete list of some of those military units. We saw the air defense and anti-missile echelon, the early warning command echelon, bombers, carrier-based aircraft, fighter aircraft and land air assault echelons – and others. According to China Daily, two female generals participated in the parade for the first time ever. In Hong Kong, streets are mostly empty and main protest areas have been blocked off. Chief executive Carrie Lam is in Beijing today, and watching proceedings among other officials. Now researchers, military scientists and some of China’s UN peacekeepers march past. Those female soldiers – wearing miniskirts – are some of the first women we’ve seen in today’s official broadcast. China has never had a woman on the politburo standing committee. Hundreds of members of the military are marching through Tiananmen Square. So far we have had the airforce, logistics support, the PLA armed police and a group of female soldiers. Xi, earlier, in his open-top car Now the military parade begins. Troops will start filing down Chang’an Avenue soon. Xi has returned to the podium to watch. Helicopters fly overhead with the Chinese flag, arranged to form a big “70”. Fighter jets, large planes and what could be the new supersonic drone are now taking off. They will soon pass over Tiananmen Square. Reminder that according to state news outlets – 40% of what we are seeing today is being unveiled for the first time. Xi continues his return to the square, behind him is commander-in-chief of the parade and commander-in-chief of the central war zone Yi Xiaoguang. Earlier, he was greeting soldiers with “Hello comrades” and “Thanks for your hard work”. Some images from earlier, during Xi’s speech. The car is now turning around and Xi is returning to Tiananmen Square. The troops shout military slogans. Xi is still driving down Chang’an Avenue, greeting the military arranged along the road, who greet him in turn. Xi wraps up his address with a call for unity, across all Chinese people, including ethnic minorities, to work together and “continue to consolidate and develop our People’s Republic”. “China’s yesterday has been written in the annals of mankind. China is now being created by millions of people. China’s tomorrow will surely be better. Our whole party will endeavour to unite and not not forget our mission. We’ll bolster the People’s Republic and development to struggle for the revival of the great Chinese dream.” He signs off, saying “Long live the CPC and the Chinese people”. Xi is then taken to an open-top car and driven down Chang’an Avenue. And on international matters, Xi says: “We must remain committed to the path of peaceful development and pursue the strategy of win-win co-operation. And continue to jointly build a community of common destiny for all mankind with people across the world.” He adds the Chinese military will “resolutely protect world peace”. “The People’s Liberation Army of China and the People’s Armed Police Force will forever retain the characters, purposes and the nature of being the people’s military,” he says. On Hong Kong: “Forging ahead, we must remain committed to the strategy of peaceful reunification and one country, two systems. We will maintain the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macau. On Taiwan: “[We must] advance the peaceful development of cross-strait relations and continue to strive for the complete reunification of our country.” He turns to economic matters now, striking a bullish note on Chinese development. “There is no force that can shake the foundation of this great nation,” he says. “No force can stop the Chinese people and the Chinese nation forging ahead.” Xi Jinping begins with a tribute to “revolutionary heroes and martyrs” and opening remarks with a heavy emphasis on China’s ethnic minotiries. “At this moment, people of all ethnic groups in China, and Chinese men and woman all over the world are filled with great joy and happiness. Proud of this great country. and sending good wishes to our great motherland.” “Let me extend a thanks to friends of all nations who have supported china’s development,” he adds. President Xi is about to speak. The flag is raised on Tiananmen Square and the crowd sings the national anthem. Soldiers are slowly march across the square to the flagpole, the giant portrait of Sun-Yat Sen looks on. Premier Li Keqiang has announced the anniversary has commenced. There is a ceremonial firing of cannons – with 56 cannons representing China’s 56 ethnic groups. They’re firing them 70 times to mark the anniversary. Xi Jinping has emerged on the balcony on the Gate of Heavenly Peace. He’s accompanied by Politburo figures and former presidents Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao. The first live footage of the parade and the military in Tiananmen Square is coming through now. A helicopter shot over Chang’an Avenue shows it packed with tanks and trucks in formation. “This event is bigger than usual,” say anchors on state broadcaster CGTN. According to the state outlet Global Times, today’s parade will feature 15,000 soldiers and 160 aircraft. 580 pieces of military equipment will be on show, forty percent of which have never been shown in public. Here are some images of parade attendees in the traditional dress of some of China’s many ethnic minorities – a common sight for choreographed state celebrations like this. Earlier today, Ilham Tohti, a Uygur academic currently in prison in China, was awarded a European human rights prize. Tothi, who was sentenced to life in prison in 2014, was awarded the Vaclav Havel Human Rights Prize in Strasbourg. He had earlier won the Martin Ennals award for human rights defenders in 2016. More pictures of the preparation here: State news outlet People’s Daily has posted this video of the preparations. Tanks and trucks stretch as far as the eye can see. But there’s also a fair amount of smog in the sky – odd, as officials usually enforce pollution control measures, and deploy cloud-seeding to clear things up in the lead-up to big events . Verna Yu in Hong Kong: Three metro stations: Admiralty, Wanchai and Prince Edward are closed all day, and eight more stations across Hong Kong, in districts that have been flash points of recent protests, will also be closed from 11am, said the Transport Department, Here is our scene-setter for today, laying out some of the global challenges facing China at the moment: And the latest on the situation in Hong Kong, where at least two high-profile activists, Ventus Lau and actor Gregory Wong, were arrested in the lead-up to today. The parade is scheduled to begin at 10am in Beijing. Which is in one hour. From Verna Yu in Hong Kong: Acting chief executive Matthew Cheung, who is deputising for Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, who is in Beijing participating in the National Day celebration, said in his speech that the government was “shocked and saddened” by the increasingly violent protests and said “violence is not a solution”. He said the government has started a series of community dialogues and is looking into programmes to improve the livelihood for ordinary citizens. After his speech, he toasted other dignitaries on the stage, who include China’s representatives and the People’s Liberation Army’s commanders. In Beijing, security forces have cleared the streets. One of the Guardian’s correspondents in Hong Kong, Verna Yu, wites: As the flag raising ceremony started at 8am local time, a dozen protesters staged a demonstration in Wanchai in the presence of riot police. “Rise up! The people who don’t want to be slaves!” they chanted, echoing the words of the Chinese national anthem. Guests watched the flag raising ceremony from a screen inside the convention and exhibition centre as the reception for the national day celebration has been moved indoors this year out of fears of disruption by activists. The flag raising ceremony has taken place outdoors in past years. The protesters displayed a black banner emblazoned: “There is no national celebration, only national mourning. End one party rule.” In Hong Kong, protests have already begun. Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the 70th anniversary of Communist party rule in China. Analysts are expecting a show of military might today, with tanks, troops, missiles and a new hypersonic drone to feature in Beijing as a military parade rolls through Tiananmen Square. There will also be an address from president Xi Jinping. And corresponding protests are ramping up in Hong Kong, even as authorities crack down and arrest activists both in the city and on the mainland. Hong Kong’s running protests are now in their 17th week, and on Monday police confirmed they fired another live gun when surrounded by protesters on Sunday. Today’s anniversary marks the day Mao Zedong consolidated Communist party control of China in October 1949, after defeating the nationalist Kuomintang party in the Chinese Civil War.
109	Boris Johnson is routinely dismissed as a liar for whom the truth is just another fling. So it is all the more perplexing that his bluster about a no-deal Brexit is taken seriously. The truth is that Johnson does not want a no-deal Brexit – and certainly not one that precedes a general election. Let’s start with the genesis of no-deal Brexit. It was an exemplar of Theresa May’s politics: a tactic invented to force her will on parliament rather than to engage in the hard graft of consensus-building political leadership. It was also an embarrassingly misguided attempt to threaten the European Union. But this gruesome political tactic metamorphosed into a political ideal, largely due to May’s own rhetoric. She did not say “it will be my deal or no deal” but rather “no deal is better than a bad deal”. It took a special depth of hubris to be so oblivious to the utopian expectations of the leave campaign – which could obviously never be met. Any deal would necessarily be dismissed as falling short. The problem, then, for Johnson is that no deal is an inherently dumb idea: it is plainly not in our interests to wreck all our trading relationships overnight and endure all the attendant chaos, only to negotiate a deal from a weakened position outside the bloc rather than within it. The specific political problem for him is that if he delivers a no-deal exit from the EU, then the ensuing chaos would all but guarantee that he would lose a general election that followed. While May never truly countenanced no deal, because she understood it would be a disaster for the country, Johnson will avoid it for the sake of self-preservation. So what happens next? It seems highly unlikely that Johnson will get a deal: no work has been done with the EU to secure it, his own foreign secretary has attacked EU leaders, and his toxic behaviour in parliament reveals he has no intention of even trying to secure a majority in the Commons. The botched prorogation supplied parliamentarians with enough time to act to block no deal. Now Johnson is again aiming to manoeuvre his opponents into delivering his preferred outcome – an extension followed by a general election where he can rally support around the future fantasy of a no-deal exit. So it seems quite plausible that Johnson will resign as prime minister after the European council summit in mid-October – saying that it will be for someone else to “wave the white flag” to Brussels – but remain as Tory leader to fight the subsequent general election. While the Lib Dems, Tory rebels and SNP might be willing to install Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister to request an extension, it is in all their interests to insist on an election immediately afterwards. So the real path to no deal is a Johnson election victory where he is so bound into his party’s extreme position that even with a majority he cannot convince them to vote for any deal. Indeed, the true fight over any no-deal Brexit will take place in the coming general election. So far, Johnson’s opponents have won some battles while losing the wider contest. There is no doubt that Johnson’s behaviour over prorogation was reprehensible, and his threats to disobey the law disgraceful, but that does not make these things politically salient. The people he is appealing to think they want a “strong leader” who will “break the rules”. So, just as with the outrage about his deliberate, calculated bigotry, putting this behaviour at the centre of politics serves only to amplify his message. The painful truth is that many people simply do not care for process or procedure. Johnson’s opponents would do far better to expose the absurdity of his stated policy positions, and their impact on peoples’ lives. Ask him how tailbacks will be managed in Kent to keep food on supermarket shelves; about the plan for a cold chain for critical medicines to keep people alive; or what will happen to the automotive industry and the thousands of jobs within it. Interrogate him on the detailed timeline for the negotiations with the EU after a no-deal exit. What would happen if the EU refused to talk until Britain agreed to the backstop and financial settlement? How many years does he expect the negotiations to last? Why would they produce a different result when Britain has less leverage? The truth is, this strongman is weak. The law has been passed to prevent no deal, so he has already lost. Despite all his bluster, Johnson has to make a deal with the EU, request an extension, or resign. We fail to expose this defeat only if we dance to Johnson’s tune and let him shape future arguments in his favour. We are discovering that living through history feels less monumental than monumentally stupid. • Tom Kibasi is director of the Institute for Public Policy Research. He writes in a personal capacity
110	The World Trade Organization has warned that the outbreak of tariff wars pose a threat to jobs and living standards as it slashed its forecast for trade growth during 2019. The Geneva-based WTO said it had more than halved its growth forecast for trade in goods this year from 2.6% to 1.2% after a summer of escalating US-China protectionism, a slowdown in global growth and fears of the impact of a no-deal Brexit. With the WTO’s ability to resolve trade disputes between its member states under threat, the organisation’s director general, Roberto Azevêdo, said the hostile environment was discouraging firms from spending on new capital. “The darkening outlook for trade is discouraging but not unexpected. Beyond their direct effects, trade conflicts heighten uncertainty, which is leading some businesses to delay the productivity-enhancing investments that are essential to raising living standards,” Azevêdo said. “Job creation may also be hampered as firms employ fewer workers to produce goods and services for export.” High-level talks between the US and China are due to resume in Washington this month in an attempt to settle a dispute in which the world’s two biggest economies have placed tariffs on more and more products. At the same time, the US has been blocking the appointment of new judges to the WTO body that decides if a country’s appeal against a ruling in a trade dispute should be upheld. The body requires three judges to operate and by December will be down to one. “Resolving trade disagreements would allow WTO members to avoid such costs,” Azevêdo said. “The multilateral trading system remains the most important global forum for settling differences and providing solutions for the challenges of the 21st-century global economy. Members should work together in a spirit of cooperation to reform the WTO and make it even stronger and more effective.” The WTO said the outlook had darkened since its last forecast in April this year, adding that its prediction of a bounce-back in trade growth to 2.7% next year depended on the trade wars coming to an end. A high level of uncertainty meant trade growth this year was likely to be in a range from 0.5% to 1.6%, with the risk that it could be even lower should trade tensions continue to build. The WTO said risks were “heavily weighted” to the downside and dominated by trade policy. “Further rounds of tariffs and retaliation could produce a destructive cycle of recrimination, while shifting monetary and fiscal policies could destabilise volatile financial markets,” the WTO said. “A sharper slowing of the global economy could produce an even bigger downturn in trade. Finally, a disorderly Brexit could have a significant regional impact, mostly confined to Europe.”
111	Jürgen Klopp has said he expects Liverpool to be punished for fielding an ineligible player in the Carabao Cup “if it was our fault alone” but Pedro Chirivella should be exempt from any censure. The EFL is due this week to consider the case against Liverpool with a fine the most likely outcome for Chirivella playing against MK Dons last Wednesday without international clearance. Expulsion from the competition or a replay of the third-round tie are other possibilities. Liverpool applied to the Football Association for clearance for the Spanish midfielder in July, after the 22-year-old’s return from an unsuccessful loan spell at Extramadura, but it was not received before his substitute appearance against MK Dons. Klopp said on Tuesday: “I cannot say too much. Other people are working on it. If it was our fault alone, we need to get punished. It didn’t happen on purpose but my only real concern is the player. He could not play for half a year in Spain last year and if he were not able to play now that would be the biggest problem. I am not sure we made a mistake but the player should not be punished.”
112	‘Sometimes when I hear your voice, it breaks my heart,” the novelist Toni Morrison told Jessye Norman at a lunch in the singer’s honour in 2014. “But all of the time when I hear your voice,” she added, “it healed my soul.” Morrison’s words reflect the impact Norman’s singing had on so many of us. She had, quite simply, one of the most beautiful voices in the world, distinctive in its range, glorious tonal warmth, range and power, which enabled her to encompass a wide repertory, which she very much made her own. Here are 10 video clips drawn from the many performances and recordings that form her legacy. Everyone has their own memories of her artistry, their own private playlists of her work. This list is by no means definitive, and I’m aware of how much I’ve had to omit. Strauss’s Ariadne was arguably Norman’s greatest operatic role, and at her peak few could match her in it. A televised performance from the Met in 1988, this captures the majesty and exaltation of her singing at its finest. Norman’s 1983 recording of the Four Last Songs with Kurt Masur and the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, grand in approach yet deeply heartfelt, is deemed as definitive by many. In 1969, at the start of her career, Norman was a lovely, dignified Countess on Colin Davis’s first recording of Mozart’s Marriage of Figaro. Norman recorded Wagner’s song cycle twice, with pianist Irwin Gage in 1970, then the orchestral version, again with Colin Davis, in 1975. The latter is notably beautiful and reflective, the former perhaps more intense and incisive. Both are included here. The richness of Norman’s lower registers enabled her to sing both mezzo-soprano and soprano roles. As a mezzo, she gave a magnificent performance of Das Lied von der Erde at the 1985 Proms, conducted by the young Simon Rattle. Norman was also very much associated with the alto solos in Mahler’s Second Symphony. This, however, is her extraordinarily touching performance of the original piano version of Urlicht, which Mahler later orchestrated to form the symphony’s fourth movement. Stravinsky’s Jocasta, in Oedipus rex, was another of Norman’s finest operatic roles. She recorded it twice, but it’s the film of her performance in Julie Taymor’s stylised 1992 Saito Kinen festival production that lingers most strongly in the memory. Brahms’s elegiac Op 91 songs for alto, piano and viola suited Norman down to the ground. Here, she’s joined by Daniel Barenboim and violist Wolfram Christ in the first of them, its mood of refined melancholy immaculately sustained. Norman also possessed a fine gift for comedy, and in 1985 recorded Offenbach’s delightfully risqué operetta La Belle Hélène, with Michel Plasson and his Toulouse orchestra, scaling down her generous tone and having fun with all the double entendres. Norman grew up in Augusta, Georgia, in segregationist times and was singing gospel songs in church by the time she was four. Later, spirituals often formed an integral part of her recital programmes, and her 1991 Carnegie Hall performance of Deep River is beautiful and poignant in the extreme.
113	If following the woeful Miami Dolphins this season wasn’t bad enough – this year’s team are generally considered to be one of the worst in the history of the NFL – one fan had to pay a considerable sum to numb the pain of watching them. Nathaniel Collier, a vendor employed to walk the Hard Rock Stadium selling drinks, charged two beers to a fan’s credit card during Sunday’s game against the Los Angeles Chargers. But instead of using the stadium’s card reader Collier used his own personal reader, and charged the fan $724. He was caught when the customer’s bank alerted them to the charge – and also listed Collier as the vendor. Miami-Dade police arrested Collier and he faces charges of grand theft and using a skimming device. The fan was given a full refund. Collier was an employee of Rocket Man, a vending subcontractor, rather than the Dolphins. He has been fired. “As the chosen provider of walking vendors across dozens of stadiums, we take the matter of security extremely seriously, and train and monitor our vendors to safeguard our customers,” Rocket Man told the Miami Herald. “Our onsite supervisor contacted the authorities immediately upon learning of the overcharge on what was Mr Collier’s unauthorized personal device.” The Dolphins lost Sunday’s game 30-10. They have lost all four of their games this season, and many believe they may not win a game this year. The Hard Rock Stadium will host this season’s Super Bowl.
114	Robin Hood Energy, the energy supplier owned by Nottingham city council, has failed to pass on £9.5m in renewable energy subsidies after collecting them from customers through their bills. The supplier has already claimed the sum from its customers, to be used to support renewable energy projects, but missed the deadline to pay its share of the money to the industry regulator, Ofgem last month. Ofgem has said the troubled energy supplier could have its supply licence revoked if it fails to pay by the end of October. In total, four of the energy suppliers - Delta Gas and Power, Gnergy, Toto Energy and Robin Hood - could lose their licences if they fail to pay a total of £14.7m to the government’s renewable support scheme. Robin Hood, set up in 2015, owes the largest sum of money followed by Toto Energy which owes £4.5m. Mary Starks, the executive director at Ofgem, said it is “unacceptable” for suppliers to shirk the renewable energy payments, and warned that suppliers “must meet their obligations, or pay the consequences” which could mean losing their licence. Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, the consumer watchdog, said that if the energy suppliers fail to pay, it would be customers who end up picking up the tab through higher bills. “This is not a new problem. Last year, less than half of the initial unpaid renewables obligation was ever paid back. Energy suppliers should not be allowed to build up these levels of debt in the first place,” she said. Citizens Advice has called for the government to bring in legislation requiring companies to make industry payments more regularly. “This would limit the cost to customers when suppliers fail to pay or exit the market,” Guy said. Energy suppliers are under pressure due to rising costs and a government cap on energy prices which, from 1 October, will fall from an average of £1,254 for gas and electricity per year to £1,179. The latest blow to the authority-owned energy supplier comes after years of financial losses, and fears the company may collapse. The council-owned supplier’s struggle to weather the fierce competition in the energy market also raises doubts over Labour’s energy plans for a public energy supplier in every region. Robin Hood made an annual loss of £713,000 in 2015, followed by losses of £2.5m in 2016 and £7.2m in 2017. It reported a small profit of £202,000 last year after Nottingham council offered it a £5.5m loan.
115	The copy of Lady Chatterley’s Lover used by the judge in the landmark 1960 obscenity trial is to remain in the UK, after the University of Bristol stepped forward to augment the money raised by a crowdfunding campaign backed by writers including Neil Gaiman and Stephen Fry. The book, which bears notes from Mr Justice Byrne’s wife, Lady Dorothy Byrne, to show where DH Lawrence strays into “coarse” territory and “love making”, was sold at auction last year to an overseas buyer for £56,250. But an export bar was placed on it by the government in the hope a UK buyer would match the price to keep in the country. Byrne’s copy has been described as “the last surviving contemporary ‘witness’” to the 1960 trial of Penguin Books, which was a test case for the Obscene Publications Act. The jury took three hours to return a not guilty verdict for Penguin, with Lady Chatterley’s Lover going on to sell 2m copies in just two years. After a crowdfunding appeal from English Pen raised more than £20,000, and Penguin Books and the TS Eliot estate donated a combined £15,000, the University of Bristol has stepped forward to acquire the book. It is “proactively seeking financial support from alumni and friends of the university to reach the rest of the total purchase price”, and will house the book in its collections as part of the Penguin Archive. “This special book will be a source of inspiration, teaching and research for our staff, students and visitors, supporting the university’s creative, scholarly and social outcomes for years to come,” said deputy vice-chancellor, professor Judith Squires. “It will be a focal point in our new university library, which is planned to open in 2023/24, providing specialist research facilities, galleries and public event spaces.” English Pen president Philippe Sands said the free speech organisation was thrilled that the campaign had been successful. “The trial involving Lady Chatterley’s Lover was a seminal moment in the continuing struggle for freedom of expression, and the judge’s copy belongs here in the UK, a singular reminder of the road travelled and remaining.” Gaiman, who was born the day after Lady Chatterley was made legal, said it was important that the book stayed in the UK. “That a crowd of people came together to contribute is proof that the internet is actually good for something,” he said.
116	Boris Johnson could be ordered by a Scottish judge to delay Brexit after pro-remain campaigners secured an emergency court hearing for this Friday. The campaigners have asked the court of session in Edinburgh to issue an interdict, or injunction, which would force the prime minister to ask the EU for an extension to article 50 if he fails to get a new deal passed at Westminster by 19 October. Lord Pentland, the judge, said he would hear the case on Friday and issue his ruling on Monday, which is likely to trigger appeals that will end with a fresh UK supreme court hearing within the next three weeks. The European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act 2019, known as the Benn Act, was passed by parliament last month and requires the government to ask for an extension until 31 January 2020 if no deal is agreed, but Downing Street officials have repeatedly suggested they will try to thwart the legislation. Asked last week whether Johnson would uphold the statute’s requirements, Downing Street said: “We will comply with the law, but we are leaving on 31 October.” The campaigners have also asked the court to bar the government from writing separately to EU leaders asking them to refuse the extension request, after it was reported No 10 may do so to try to thwart the Benn Act. The case has been brought by Jolyon Maugham QC, an anti-Brexit legal campaigner, and Joanna Cherry QC, a Scottish National party MP, who were both involved in last week’s supreme court ruling which said Johnson had prorogued parliament unlawfully, and has been funded by the green energy entrepreneur Dale Vince. Pentland, an outer house judge, could issue or reject the interdict on Monday, or he could rule that the case has to be heard and decided by the inner house, the senior tier of the court of session, which is Scotland’s civil court. Vince’s legal action was originally due to be heard by the inner house next Tuesday because it has a power unique within the UK to take action if someone refuses to do something they are legally obliged to do. That authority is known as the nobile officium, and Vince, Maugham and Cherry are likely to ask the inner house to use those powers to write to the EU seeking the extension on the prime minister’s behalf if he refuses to do so. Pentland’s decision came after some hasty legal manoeuvring by Vince’s legal team. They had learned that the government’s lawyers were planning to argue next week that the case should have been heard first in the outer house, where Pentland sits. That would have delayed their case, so in an effort to prevent that happening, Vince’s lawyers applied on Monday for an urgent hearing in the outer house to ensure it was dealt with urgently in that tier. Whichever side loses is likely to appeal directly to the supreme court, setting the scene for further constitutional turmoil after 11 supreme court judges ruled unanimously that Johnson’s suspension of parliament was “unlawful, void and of no effect”. David Gauke, the rebel former cabinet minister, has predicted there would also be legal challenges in the English courts if Johnson refused to uphold the Benn Act. Maugham said time was now running out; there were only 13 court sitting days until the 19 October deadline. “We want it all determined before 19 October because a delay for the prime minister could be as good as a refusal [of our motion],” he said. “We are acting now to ensure he faces the consequences if he breaches the obligation placed upon him by parliament.”
117	After 30 years of recommendations, five years of intense lobbying, three years of funding negotiations and two years of political promises, a lifesaving service that could prevent deaths in custody has been rolled out across Western Australia. The custody notification service (CNS) has been trialled since July and went statewide at 12.01am on Wednesday. It places a mandatory requirement on police who take an Indigenous person into custody for any reason, including protective custody provisions for intoxication or under the Mental Health Act, to call a 24/7 hotline staffed by the Aboriginal Legal Service (ALSWA). It is based on the New South Wales CNS that has been operational for 19 years. It was also a recommendation of the 1991 royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody. The family of Yamatji woman Ms Dhu, who died after suffering a critical health decline in a Port Hedland police cell after being jailed for unpaid fines in 2014, campaigned for a CNS in WA for five years. An inquest heard it could have saved her life. Legislation to end the practice of jailing for unpaid fines was introduced to parliament last week. ALSWA chief executive Dennis Eggington said the service would be staffed by “an incredible team who have undergone a rigorous expert training program in many areas including cultural awareness, relevant legal issues, mental health, disability, suicide prevention and trauma-informed practice”. The scheme costs $1m a year and is jointly funded, with commonwealth funding of $2.7m over three years. The Northern Territory received the same funding. Legislation to create a Victorian custody notification service came into effect on Tuesday. The Victorian laws require police to ask everyone they arrest if they identify as an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person, and to contact the Victoria Aboriginal Legal Service within the hour of taking an Indigenous person into custody for any reason. It replaces a non-mandatory scheme that has been in place since the early 1990s and will be staffed by volunteers from the expanded Aboriginal community justice panel program. “A Custodial Notification Scheme can prevent deaths and injuries in custody – that’s why we’ve enshrined one in legislation,” Victorian attorney-general Jill Hennessy said. An investigation by Guardian Australia found that at least 424 Indigenous people have died in custody in Australia in the 30 years since the royal commission. Only one Aboriginal person, Wiradjuri woman Rebecca Maher, has died in a police station in NSW since the introduction of the CNS. A coronial inquest into Maher’s death recommended NSW expand the service to include intoxicated people held under protective custody laws. South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania are the only states without the mandatory notification scheme.
118	The Australian corporate regulator says it provided information to American authorities to assist in prosecuting an insider trading case against the Trump-supporting congressman Christopher Collins. Collins, the first congressman to publicly support Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign, resigned on Monday ahead of an appearance in court on Tuesday when he was expected to plead guilty to insider trading charges related to an Australian biotech company where he was a director and one of the largest shareholders. The company, Innate Immunotherapeutics, was developing a treatment for multiple sclerosis, but its share price plunged 92% in June 2017 when it revealed the drug had failed a crucial trial. A spokesman for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said the regulator provided data about trading in Innate, and other supporting information, to the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Collins, a Republican from New York, allegedly learned of the trial’s failure on the evening of 22 June 2017, while he was attending a congressional picnic hosted by Trump on the South Lawn of the White House. He and other board members were emailed the bad news by the company’s chief executive. According to court documents, 15 minutes later Collins responded: “Wow. Makes no sense. How are these results even possible???” It is alleged that within a minute of sending this email, Collins began calling his son Cameron, who also owned millions of Innate shares, to tell him the drug trial had failed. According to court documents, father and son missed each other six times over four minutes, but eventually the call connected. TV cameras caught Collins on the phone at the picnic. At the time, Australian investors were not able to buy or sell Innate stock on the ASX, where it was listed, because it had gone into a trading halt ahead of announcing the trial had failed. However, early the following morning Cameron Collins, who has also been charged, allegedly began selling his stake on the US secondary “over the counter” or “pink slips” market. He allegedly sold about 1.3m shares, avoiding about US$570,000 in losses when the company came out of its trading halt and the stock price tumbled. Cameron Collins is also accused of tipping off his girlfriend and members of her family, none of whom are charged with any crime, that the drug had failed. In a related civil case, the SEC claims it was Cameron Collins who convinced the family to get into the stock in the first place. “I think we all need to consider investing in innate therapeutics,” his girlfriend told her mother in an August 2016 text message, court documents show. She said a US$15,000 investment had a more than 50% chance of ballooning to $250,000. “That is actually unheard of and cams dad almost guarantees it within the next 1 to 2 years,” she said in the text message. In further text messages sent to her mother over the following days she said that “we’ll always keep in touch with cams dad who I’m guessing would know how things are looking as we get closer to the end of the trial”. “I’ll make sure cams dad keeps us in the loop,” she said. Collins resigned from the Innate board on 4 May last year. The company, which has been contacted for comment, has changed its name to Amplia Therapeutics and is now working on cancer and fibrosis treatments.
119	You develop a certain immunity to the news these days. You can’t succumb to despair every time the prime minister lies or the leader of the House of Commons makes a debasing remark about parliament, there simply isn’t time. I find it quite surprising, now, to feel depressed by the Today programme. And yet on Monday the Saj did reawaken that political nerve, on a tour of the broadcast studios to preview his unmemorable conference speech. “Everyone on the doorstep,” the chancellor proclaimed, “is saying, ‘get Brexit done’. They don’t say, ‘cancel the result’. They don’t say, ‘have a second referendum’. They say, ‘get Brexit done’.” As a matter of observable fact, this can’t be right: what about the 6 million who signed the petition to revoke article 50? Or the 16 million-plus who voted remain? Or the young voters who came of age after 2016? And on and on. Sajid Javid would have been safer sticking to the formula deployed by the Conservative party chairman, James Cleverly. He told an audience in Manchester this week that he had been “knocking on very traditional Victorian terraced houses” in Darlington, where he met a guy who said: “You’re that Tory. I’m going to vote for you lot.” It might not get past a creative writing tutor, but at least it’s not immediately falsifiable. Of course, the chancellor didn’t literally mean “everyone on the doorstep”. He was using a new parlance, in which “everyone” doesn’t mean “all the citizens” but “all the authentic citizens”. How can you tell which citizens are the authentic ones? They’re the ones who agree with the proposition that we must Get Brexit Done. At root, this is an old political trick – nicely described by the cultural theorist Stuart Hall in 2012: “Politicians always think they know what people feel. It’s a fallacy, because there is no such thing as ‘the people’. It is a discursive device for summoning the people that you want. You’re constructing the people, you’re not reflecting the people.” Our current politics deploys that technique on ketamine: slower, dumber, more intense. It is now considered reasonable to stand up and say: “I’ve met all the real people, and they all agree with me.” The habit has spread from politicians to commentators, so it’s not unusual to see 20-something rightwing thinktankers on TV current affairs programmes confidently telling everyone what “the people” want – to which one is tempted to reply, “mate, which people? Who have you even met, ever, in your whole life?” Which of course misses the point. It’s a construction, not a reflection. But where once, as Hall notes, it constructed a shared view of “common sense”, now its purpose is the obliteration of reasonable difference or dissent. If you don’t adhere to the view that “the people” are said to hold – no matter how extreme – you’re not merely wrong. You are simply not real. The invocation of this all-powerful imaginary “people” has put predictable pressure on those opinion canvassers of the media who think of themselves as neutral – the BBC and other broadcasters, with their ever-more controversial vox pops. There are, it transpires, some surprisingly radical views in the nation at large: among the eyebrow-raisers have been the man who told the BBC in January that it will be character building for us to run short of food, and the guy who signalled his willingness to pay even with his own life for a no-deal Brexit, should it cause him to run short of the medication he needs. Setting aside the questionable significance of these individual views, there are endless methodological questions around the sampling of “random” vox pops. The notion – presented with a straight face by a BBC news presenter in Stoke last week – that a few people you corral at midday in a shopping centre represent “a cross-section of voters” is obviously absurd. Fundamentally, though, the spectre of what any given group ought to think haunts the reporters. When they’re in a “leave area” and someone gives the “wrong” answer – suggesting, for instance, that Boris Johnson should resign – they are no longer representative of the area, and the reporter has to set off in search of another person who can say the right thing for “balance”. There is no such thing as a neutral survey in the world of the vox pop: the TV camera brings an invitation to strike a pose, but it also reflects the expectation of the person behind the camera from the exchange and the thousand subtle ways in which they convey it. I was always struck, when I went on reporting trips to a town at the same time as other journalists, how we would all come back with a different man-on-the-street. One would always meet the people who felt displaced by immigrants; another would unfailingly meet the one who hated Jeremy Corbyn; and I would come back with a weird story about someone’s daughter-in-law who was obsessed with colouring-in books, and it would turn out she had an anxiety disorder, and then it would transpire that she was on a zero-hours contract. The point is not that they were biased and I was neutral and this paper is better than all the others: it’s interesting precisely because we unintentionally and in good faith dig for the stories we’re interested in. It is, in the end, not an encounter between a scientist and a specimen – but two people trying to connect. What is produced is always idiosyncratic, and only revealing insofar as you’re prepared to consider what it reveals about both sides of the encounter. This isn’t to say that interviewing people is corrupted simply because the interviewers are human too. What’s problematic is the politically expedient contention that there are opinions that are held by all members of a demographic group – from northerners, women, millennials, pensioners, all the way up to “the people”. When we recognise that as a fallacy, we might finally be able to hear one another. • Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist
120	As a child, Rebecca Sugar always loved those “animated movies that ended in a beautiful wedding between characters that only met a few days earlier”. Even if, as a queer, non-binary child, she didn’t always feel reflected by the strangling gender norms of Disney films. The 32-year-old animator is now enjoying – and adding to – a very different cartoon landscape. This year, viewers of the children’s show Arthur saw Mr Ratburn marry an aardvark (and chocolatier) named Patrick. In 2017, the Disney animation Doc McStuffins aired an episode featuring an interracial lesbian couple. And, last year, Sugar’s own series, Steven Universe, became the first kids’ show to feature a lesbian wedding. For self-professed geeks in the LGBT community, Sugar is something of a gay-eity. In 2011, she got her break as a writer and storyboard artist on the animated series Adventure Time. She earned six Emmy nominations and a slot on Forbes magazine’s “30 under 30 in entertainment” list for her contribution to many of the best episodes. There, she laid the groundwork for the cult character Marceline, a bisexual vampire queen and one half of the queer cartoon couple dubbed “Bubbline”. In the show’s finale, she and her girlfriend, Princess Bubblegum, sealed their largely offscreen romance with a long-awaited onscreen kiss. Sugar left to continue her work moving LGBT stories from the margins into the mainstream with Steven Universe. In doing so, she became the first woman to independently create a series for Cartoon Network. It is an all-ages sci-fi romp with lots of heart. The titular character is sworn to protect humanity from intergalactic threats, alongside a ragtag gang of ageless alien warriors called Crystal Gems. They project female holographic, humanoid forms from magical gemstones embedded in their bodies, which are akin to brains. This may sound complex, but the show is renowned for its simple approach to often inaccessible themes for children, such as consent, grief, anxiety and abusive relationships. Sugar uses the show to process difficult parts of her personal life. When she was 22, she and her partner (the show’s supervising director, Ian Jones-Quartey, who is black) were the victims of a racist assault. This is addressed in the fan-favourite song Stronger Than You, which is performed by the character Garnet, voiced by the British R&amp;B singer Estelle. “There are ways I can talk about my relationship with Ian and the obstacles we face, my own experience with antisemitism, my experience coming out as bisexual as a teenager,” she says. “The layer of fantasy in the show allows me to have fun with truths that are not fun.” Garnet is a queer Trojan horse of sorts. We are introduced to her as a singular character, but it is later revealed that she is a fusion of two Gems called Ruby and Sapphire, who choose to remain fused out of love for each other. When they were married, Ruby, the more masculine of the two, was depicted in a bridal gown, while femme-Gem Sapphire sported a tux – a nightmare for countries that had skirted the depiction of a same-sex relationship by coding Ruby as male. The recent push for diversity in media has seen a rise in “retcon” (“retroactive continuity”) – the addition of new information that alters previously described events. For instance, JK Rowling belatedly revealed that Dumbledore and Grindelwald from the Harry Potter novels had been lovers, a move that was deemed a bandwagon-jumping afterthought. But Ruby and Sapphire’s relationship has been key to Steven Universe since the start. “We wanted you to understand that you already knew Ruby and Sapphire, because you already knew Garnet,” says Sugar. “We tried to bake that into the premise – you already love and care about the relationship between Ruby and Sapphire, because you already love and care about Garnet.” The wedding decision was not taken lightly. Sugar was aware that the episode, as well as her decision to come out as bisexual, could lead to funding being pulled or the show being dropped altogether. Her fears were hardly unfounded: Arthur’s first attempt at LGBT inclusion was shot down in 2005, when its spinoff show, Postcards from Buster, was pulled from PBS after taking flak for featuring a lesbian couple. The anime show Sailor Moon featured a lesbian couple, whom US TV networks opted to portray as cousins. More recently, a Steven Universe episode featuring a “fusion” scene with a lesbian subtext was censored in Britain. The same episode featured heterosexual dancing and kissing. “I decided I would rather do this and face that reality than not do this and have a longer running,” she says. “It was a matter of breaking down the false assumption that same-sex romance is somehow inherently more adult, which it’s not. We needed to show, over and over again, that there was nothing less wholesome about these two characters together than any other animated wedding ever aired on Cartoon Network. And so we worked hard to make these characters as cute and lovable as possible, so there’s just no way to deny that they should be married.” Steven Universe, which has as many adult fans as child fans, isn’t just deemed radical and groundbreaking for its same-sex relationships. One episode nods to polyamory, with a character who consists of six romantically involved Gems called Fluorite. Its exploration of gender is just as celebrated: Steven, a male, and his friend Connie, a female, fuse to create the gender-neutral Steveonnie, who uses “they/them” pronouns. Most notably, Sugar has said that the Gems are non-binary women. “I was writing these characters before I was familiar with a lot of the terminology,” she says. “But it was such a fun way to express myself – particularly in the way that people think they are women, but I know that they are actually not. It is so much the feeling I’ve had navigating my life. I can really make them act and exist outside of the rules that always felt so alienating to me.” This year, Queer Eye’s Jonathan Van Ness and the musician Sam Smith have come out as non-binary, which has been met with equal amounts of support and derision. “But what’s exciting now is that we have ways of finding each other,” Sugar says. “Even if the confusion exists, we are not confused.” Steven himself (based on Sugar’s younger brother) is a direct challenge to the archetypal male hero in most cartoons. His emotional intelligence is his greatest asset in battle. He cries, he uses a pink shield and he is often depicted in a dress; in the episode Sadie’s Song, he dons makeup, a crop top, a skirt and heels. Cultural shifts such as this have led critics to suggest we are in a golden age of western animation – shows such as BoJack Horseman, Rick and Morty and Big Mouth also deal artfully with the unsaid. Sugar is held up as a beacon of progress, but she is keenly aware of just how rare a gem she is. “Often, when there are these moments, if you really look at it, it may be coming from two or three people that make several things,” she says. “You think: ‘Wow, this was an era of really innovative storytelling!’ but it’s just a few individuals fighting for something they really believe in.” Steven Universe: The Movie is on Cartoon Network on 1 October at 8pm
121	A record number of homeless people died last year, in the biggest increase in deaths since reporting began, amid warnings fatalities are likely to be even higher in 2019. Charities and MPs have said austerity and cuts to services are driving a worsening homelessness crisis, as figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that an estimated 726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018. This is a 22% rise from 2017 and the biggest increase since the data was first collected in 2013. The shadow housing secretary, John Healey, asking an urgent question in the Commons about deaths among homeless people, said: “This shames us all … This demands a response from the prime minister himself tomorrow in his party conference speech.” Jon Sparkes, the chief executive of the charity Crisis, said: “It is heartbreaking that hundreds of people were forced to spend the last days of their lives without the dignity of a secure home.” His words were echoed by the housing minister Luke Hall: “There is no shying away from these statistics. They are heartbreaking.” Those collecting data for the Museum of Homelessness said the number of deaths for 2019 is likely to be even higher. “We do think that [from what we have recorded so far] we will really see an increase again, so the picture will get bleaker,” said Jessica Turtle, co-founder of the Museum of Homelessness. The biggest increase was in drug-related deaths, which rose by 55% compared with 2017. Figures showed there were 131 deaths related to opiate poisoning, predominantly involving heroin and morphine. There was also a doubling in deaths related to cocaine, increasing from 15 in 2017 to 30 in 2018. Further concern has also been raised about the dangers of substances such as the synthetic cannabinoid spice, also known as black mamba, which experts say is ravaging vulnerable communities. “It features in quite a few of the stories we have been researching … also from our work on the ground … a lot of people have overdosed on spice,” Turtle said. She said that making psychoactive substances illegal in May 2016 had made the situation worse, driving spice into an underground market that produced a stronger blend of the drug. Turtle said people were mainly dying from drug and alcohol misuse, which is directly linked to a cut in services. “A lot of these deaths are preventable,” she said. She said austerity was having a direct impact, citing an example in Middlesbrough, where it was reported this year that homeless people had died since a council redeployed staff helping them. A council team had provided “intensive support” for rough sleepers but its three staff were moved in April. At a cafe for homeless people in Middlesbrough, Susan Gill said nine of her regulars had died since April. Gill, who runs the Neighbourhood Welfare homeless hub, said the future for homeless people in the area was “incredibly bleak”. “I have literally just had someone taken away in an ambulance because he had overdosed,” she said. “They come in here for a warm meal and some tea but their lives are so chaotic. They are just desperate and there is no help out there. Some don’t want help but others really, really do and that’s why it is so tragic because we can save them if we just tried.” Gill said the introduction of universal credit had plunged many into poverty, leaving them vulnerable to homelessness and mental health problems. “Sometimes they deliberately turn to drugs and take overdoses because there is literally no hope for them. We need more services which intervene before they get to that point, the point where they decide they can’t come back,” she said. In Manchester, where the problem is particularly acute, figures suggest 19 people died. This ranks it as the city with the third-highest mortality rate among homeless people in the country. John Leech, a Liberal Democrat councillor in Manchester, said the figures were deeply worrying. “Perhaps most tragically, these figures are just the tip of the iceberg. Walk down any city centre street and you will see people with next to nothing to their name,” he said. “Today’s figures don’t just highlight the gross incompetence and lack of priorities from local and national politicians, nor is it just a complete embarrassment, but it exposes the deeply worrying, critical and consistent failure of a local and national system that simply doesn’t care.” Birmingham had the highest number of deaths recorded by any local authority in the country with 23 homeless people dying, an increase of 18 people from the previous year. Liam Byrne, the Labour MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill, said: “This is a moral emergency and none of us can continue to stand by – we need urgent action.” Most of the deaths in 2018 were among men, accounting for 641 estimated deaths and 88% of the total. The mean age at death was 45 years for men and 43 for women, far lower than for the general population, which is 76 years and 81 years for men and women respectively. Two in five deaths of homeless people were related to drug poisoning in 2018 (294 estimated deaths), and the number of deaths from this has increased by 55% since 2017. London and the north-west had the highest numbers of deaths in 2018, with 148 (20% of the total number) and 103 (14% of the total number) estimated deaths of homeless people respectively. The figures included rough sleepers and people using emergency accommodation such as shelters and hostels. A government spokesperson said: “Every single death on our streets is one too many and these statistics are a sombre reminder that there is still much more to do to tackle homelessness and end rough sleeping for good. “Drugs can devastate lives, ruin families and damage communities, which is why we are undertaking a comprehensive review which will help protect the most vulnerable – including homeless individuals – from the harm that drugs cause and give them a chance to recover and turn their lives around.”
122	Labour has accused the government of “old-fashioned pork-barrel politics” after it emerged that the overwhelming majority of areas promised help with future hospital rebuilding programmes are in Conservative-held seats or are those targeted by the party. Under plans announced at the start of the Tory party conference, hospitals in 21 areas of England will receive so-called seed funding to assist with plans for building or rebuilding schemes earmarked for the end of next decade. Analysis of the list shows that of the 21 areas, some of which include more than one eligible hospital, 15 are entirely or partly represented by Tory MPs. Four will be likely Conservative targets at the next general election. Just two, Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham and North Manchester General, are in safe Labour seats. Almost 40% of the designated sites are in the west or south-west of England, where the Conservatives are facing pressure from the resurgent Liberal Democrats. During a fringe event on Monday evening at the party conference, Boris Johnson appeared to add another hospital to the list, saying Canterbury would get one of the “new hospitals we are building”. The Canterbury parliamentary seat is ultra-marginal, having been won by Labour in the 2017 election by just 187 votes, the first time it was not held by the Conservatives. The initial government announcement promised 40 new hospitals. It soon emerged that the plan was for new or renovated buildings at just six sites, with the promise of future funding in 21 other areas. Asked at a Tory conference fringe event whether there had been a political dimension to the choice of hospitals the health secretary, Matt Hancock, rejected this, saying one of the six initial projects was based in the Leicester constituency of Labour’s Jonathan Ashworth. But Labour said the first projects were already largely decided, whereas there was considerably more scope for choice over which areas received help with longer-term plans. The party has also expressed scepticism over whether the funding would actually materialise. Ashworth told the Guardian: “This isn’t a strategic hospital plan, it’s a blatant attempt at old-fashioned pork-barrel politics. Indeed, Boris Johnson has just out of the blue added another hospital to the list in a Labour marginal constituency. “The reality is Tory MPs and candidates are misleading voters in marginal seats because not a single penny piece of new money has been set aside to rebuild any of these hospitals. As always with Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock, they over-spin and under-deliver.” The announcement has been used by Conservative MPs in many of the relevant areas to tout for votes, with at least nine sending tweets in recent days to hail the promised extra funding. Johnny Mercer, the defence minister whose Plymouth Moor seat is targeted by Labour, tweeted a video saying the city would get a new £600m hospital, calling opposition scepticism about it “Labour lies”. Sarah Newton, the Tory MP for Truro and Falmouth, tweeted that Truro would get a new hospital costing £450m, calling it “a gamechanger for healthcare in Cornwall”. Newton has a majority of less than 4,000. Hancock’s office was contacted for comment.
123	Hong Kong police have shot a protester with live ammunition for the first time in four months of demonstrations, marking a major escalation in the use of force on a day when China celebrated 70 years of Communist party rule with a triumphalist military parade. Protests called to mark a “national day of grief” drew tens of thousands of people on to the city’s streets, across six areas, in the most widespread show yet of public anger towards Beijing. Some gathered in central Hong Kong, while others met up across the harbour in Kowloon and the New Territories beyond. Initially peaceful, the demonstrations turned into running battles that in some places ran on past midnight. Authorities shut down nearly half the city’s metro stations in an attempt to contain the violence. Police in full riot gear used water cannon and barrages of teargas, while protesters threw molotov cocktails, built barricades, attacked metro stations and lit fires in the street. The scenes, though extremely violent, did not mark a departure from previous protests until mid-afternoon, when a policeman fired a bullet into an 18-year-old high school student’s chest in Tsuen Wan district. Images shared by local media showed the protester lying on the ground begging for help as he bled from his injury. “Send me to hospital, my chest is hurting. I need to go to hospital,” he said. Although warning shots have been fired during other protests, police have caused serious injury with rubber bullets and beanbag rounds, and groups including Amnesty International have condemned excessive use of force, this was the first time someone has been hit with a live round. A video posted by the Hong Kong University Students Union appeared to show the policeman shooting the student at point blank range with a pistol, as a group of protesters attacked another officer. Commissioner of police Stephen Lo Wai-chung said the use of a live round was “lawful and reasonable”, and the man had been arrested for assaulting a police officer after he was taken to hospital. The officer opened fire after protesters attacked a policeman who was lying on the ground, Lo told the SCMP. “So when an officer felt that officers’ lives were under serious threat, he fired a live round.” Six live rounds were fired in total during the protests on Tuesday, he added. The UK said the use of live ammunition was “disproportionate”, while Amnesty International called for an urgent and independent investigation. Crowds gathered in central Hong Kong, where police were using water cannon and teargas, fell silent when they heard someone had been shot. But violence soon resumed, and in some places intensified, as protesters faced off with police into the evening. Later a journalist from the local RTHK network was taken to hospital after a projectile hit him in the face, prompting the network to withdraw all its reporters from the streets. Health authorities said at least 66 people were injured in protests, the youngest only 11 and the oldest 75. Two were in a critical condition, and two in a serious condition. Hong Kong has been gripped by protests since June. Sparked by a controversial extradition bill, they have morphed into a wider and increasingly violent anti-government movement channelling residents’ anger and frustration at the erosion of rights under Chinese rule. Tuesday’s marchers had already defied a police ban to turn out in large numbers. Organisers wanted to mark the 70th anniversary of communist China as a day of mourning not celebration, and tens of thousands came out in response. “We want to show people this is not a happy anniversary,” said Richard Hung, who works in the technology sector. “The CCP [Chinese Communist party] has killed or injured so many millions of people already. We have come out today, because if we don’t, we may not have another chance.” For the first few hours, the main march through the city centre was peaceful, with protesters dressed largely in black singing “glory to Hong Kong”, scattering paper money used for funeral offerings, and scrawling protest slogans on streets, bus stations and shops seen as pro-Beijing. Graffiti included anti-China messages mocking the day’s celebrations across the border, calls for freedom and democracy, and a warning with a prophetic ring that has become a protest staple: “if you burn, we burn with you”. Many families and young children were among the crowds at first. “You can see, we don’t have any protective gear,” said Terrence, a logistics worker walking with his eight-year-old daughter. “We want freedom, and don’t want to belong to China.” Still, a large proportion of protesters wore face masks or carried umbrellas, to stop them being filmed or identified by authorities who have already arrested hundreds. Some have been charged with rioting, which carries a sentence of up to 10 years. Police had said ahead of Tuesday that they feared violent protests, and made a string of raids and arrests, claiming to have uncovered bomb-making equipment and ingredients. Aggressive policing and the scale of the recent violence fuelled fears that authorities might use it as a pretext to bring in draconian emergency legislation, which would allow the government to arrest people at will, and control the press and communications, in the name of stability. “It seems there is no sign of this coming to an end until the government is determined to clamp down,” said pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho Kwan-yiu, who has previously called for an emergency law, in a statement carried by the South China Morning Post. The day began with an episode of police aggression, when officers used pepper spray on a small group of protesters outside the government’s official flag-raising ceremony and national day reception, which was closed to the public. It was calm throughout the morning, as Beijing celebrated its anniversary and rise to super-power status with a military parade showing off its latest hardware, and a civilian procession celebrating everything from communist heroes to agriculture and bicycles. Hong Kong’s protesters began turning out only after those events wrapped up, preparing their own response to mark the day. “It’s National Day but there is nothing to be happy about in Hong Kong,” said Sarah, 17. “We’re under one party rule and the Communist party controls our government.”
124	Nissan could tear up plans to build its Qashqai model in Sunderland if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal, according to reports, putting a plant employing 7,000 people at risk of closure. The Japanese carmaker promised in 2016 to build the new version of the SUV in Sunderland, after receiving assurances from Theresa May’s government that it would be protected from the impact of Brexit. But with the company in the midst of savage global job cuts due to poor financial performance, executives will revisit the plan if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of the month, according to sources who spoke to the Financial Times. The Qashqai accounts for two-thirds of the 440,000 cars produced by Nissan in Sunderland each year, raising fears that the plant, which also makes the Juke and electric Leaf models, could close altogether. About 7,000 people work at the site. Nissan said its plans to build the Qashqai in Sunderland “have not changed”. But it added: “Today we are among those companies with major investments in the UK who are still waiting for clarity on what the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU will look like. “As a sudden change from those rules to the rules of the World Trade Organisation will have serious implications for British industry, we urge UK and EU negotiators to work collaboratively towards an orderly balanced Brexit that will continue to encourage mutually beneficial trade. “Frictionless trade has enabled the growth that has seen our Sunderland plant become the biggest factory in the history of the UK car industry, exporting more than half of its production to the EU.” Theresa May’s government offered Nissan up to £80m of state aid in 2016 to coax it into building new generations of the Qashqai and X-Trail in Sunderland. After initially appearing to have been convinced by the offer, the carmaker eventually decided against building the X-Trail there, citing Brexit among its chief concerns. In March, it said it would also cease production of the Infiniti marque at Sunderland, putting 250 jobs at risk, as it withdrew from the luxury sector in western Europe. It has also been retrenching in the face of dismal financial performance around the world, announcing plans in July to cut up to 10,000 jobs. Nissan is the latest in a long line of firms in the automotive sector to issue dire warnings about Brexit, or withdraw or pause investment in anticipation of it. Earlier this year, Honda announced plans to close its Swindon plant, initially insisting that Brexit had nothing to do with the decision. The claim was later undermined after the Guardian revealed that the car company had briefed local people that Brexit posed a threat to the factory’s future. Jaguar Land Rover, which is the UK’s largest carmaker and employs 40,000 people, has previously warned that a hard Brexit could disrupt its investment plans and kill off entire industries. At the Geneva motor show earlier this year, a string of carmakers including BMW, Toyota, Bentley and Peugeot maker PSA also voiced grave concerns. One of the chief concerns in the industry, which employs more than 800,000 people in the UK, is the risk of disruption to “just in time” manufacturing processes that ensure the smooth and swift flow of car parts across borders. Earlier this year, Boris Johnson dismissed concerns about such disruption expressed by the Jaguar Land Rover chief executive, Ralf Speth, saying he was “not certain” the Germany automotive veteran knew more than him about the industry.
125	As I entered Theresa May’s London study, what I saw shocked me. May was in a terrible way, one moment almost catatonic, the next in a state of extreme agitation. “These are dark, dark, times, Grayling,” she said gravely. “The whole of Europe stands on the brink. Unless Prof Johnson can be stopped there will be a chaos the like of which has never before been imagined. Come, Grayling, there is no time to lose. The game is afoot.” We hastily packed our bags and took a train to Brussels. There we narrowly avoided an attempt on our lives by Robert Oxley, one of the professor’s more dangerous agents, before moving on to Strasbourg. As we zigzagged across the capitals of Europe, still Johnson contrived to keep one step ahead of us. After more than a month, we eventually arrived in the Swiss town of Meiringen and it was only then that May appeared to relax. “We have him now, Grayling,” she said, her mouth stretching into a thin smile. “Johnson is trapped in our backstop. Let us go for a walk up to the Reichenbach Falls.” It was a pleasant late afternoon and although the pale watery sun provided little warmth, I had no need of a cagoule such was the pace at which May walked. I must admit that I was somewhat relieved when we were accosted by a rather rude, dishevelled man in a grey tracksuit with a bulldog clip attached to his collar, insisting we come to the assistance of a woman further down the mountain who had lost her laptop and was in need of a £100,000 grant. “You go, Grayling,” May demanded of me. “I will proceed to the top of the falls.” For a long while that was the last I saw of May. I know now that she had identified the crumpled man as Cummings, the professor’s right-hand, self-styled genius, and had allowed me to fall for his trap of separating us so that she could confront Johnson alone. Their bodies were never found. I could only assume she sacrificed her own life in pushing Johnson to his death over the no-deal cliff edge. A great peace settled over Europe – a transition period marked with joy and celebrations. And yet I was consumed with grief for the loss of the bravest, most noble woman I had ever known. But one day there was a knock on my door. “Good heavens!” I exclaimed. “Is that you, May?” “Indeed it is, Grayling,” she replied. “So clamorous were the demands of UK citizens that I have made an unlikely reappearance. Although everyone feared me dead, I actually hung on to a branch as Johnson toppled on to the rocks many hundreds of feet below.” “By heavens, that’s wonderful. So where have you been since?” “Waiting for a Seaborne Freight ferry.”
126	It is agreed by all that this is the moment of truth. When Michel Barnier privately warned the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, last Friday that he needed firm proposals imminently for a revised Brexit deal to have a chance of being agreed by leaders at an EU summit on 17 October, Barclay concurred, according to leaked minutes seen by the Guardian. For the UK to have a hope of ratification by 31 October, the gears in Whitehall needed to not merely whir but to mesh with the cogwheels in Brussels within days. During a blizzard of media rounds on Tuesday morning, Boris Johnson agreed that he would know by this weekend whether a deal was possible. The broad parameters of what the UK is proposing have started to become visible in recent days. The prime minister rightly points to his proposal of a single agri-food zone on the island of Ireland as a significant shift from his mantra during the Tory leadership campaign position that the Irish backstop had to be ditched in its entirety. Indeed, Johnson has suggested that the single regulatory zone for agricultural goods should be permanent, citing Ian Paisley’s refrain that the people of Northern Ireland may be British but its cattle are Irish. This would avoid the need for sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) checks on the Irish border for 30% of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and 70% of it by flow. EU sources say there are also signs that if a mechanism can be found for gaining the consent of the people of Northern Ireland then a temporary single-regulatory zone on the island of Ireland could be agreed for manufactured goods. It is understood that Barnier told Barclay on Friday that he was willing to talk about consent, or governance as the EU negotiator described it, once the UK government made its move on the scope of the single regulatory zone. They could jump together. Could that be the route to agreeing a time limit on regulatory alignment in manufactured goods? A role could be found for Stormont in agreeing to continued alignment after a period four years – up to the point by which the rest of the UK may be diverging. The “germ of an idea” of a single SPS zone, as Johnson described it, could be flowering into something more significant. But that leaves the big issue of customs – precisely the issue that tormented Theresa May. The government has been creditably clear that it will not sign up to a deal that leaves Northern Ireland outside its customs territory. May told the Commons that no British prime minister could agree to such a proposal and Johnson has said the whole of the UK must leave the EU as one customs territory. The customs non-paper submitted to the European commission by the UK has caused a kerfuffle because it spells out the logical consequence of that: customs checks and controls on the island of Ireland. The strawman reported by Irish broadcasters is a string of custom clearance centres five to 10 miles from the border. That has been an easy suggestion to knock back. The UK is instead looking at what it describes as a light-touch customs regime. The customs authorities would use GPS for the real-time tracking of goods and freight traffic over the border, with the paperwork carried out in advance. Trusted traders, and small and medium-sized businesses that benefit from exemptions, would in the most part cross through without trouble, but customs authorities would electronically flag those down who cause any concern. They could be asked to report to a designated centre or, more likely, be checked at their own premises. The UK has suggested the Republic of Ireland could mirror those arrangements, with close border control cooperation between customs authorities on both sides. But, if that is the big idea, this moment of truth is likely to be a sobering one. The EU says you cannot decouple customs and regulatory checks because it is through customs returns that goods are followed. It argues that the exemptions for many traders would open the door to smuggling. It is claimed that the supervision required in such circumstances would be destabilising to both the Irish economy and peace. So where to go next? The ratification of a deal will rely on a significant U-turn by Johnson, and a major concession by the EU. Johnson needs to accept that Northern Ireland will remain in the EU’s customs territory – but for a temporary period. Dublin needs to be persuaded that such a time limit is better than a no-deal Brexit now. There is no guarantee of success in parliament, despite some hopeful signs from the DUP and Tory Brexit “Spartans”. Big decisions are necessary on both sides. The last three years suggest they may well be ducked again.
127	House prices in Britain unexpectedly fell last month amid mounting fears over the impact of no-deal Brexit on the property market. According to the latest snapshot from the Nationwide building society, prices fell in September by 0.2%, pulling down the average price of a home to £215,352 from £216,096 in August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.1% rise on the month. With just 30 days until Britain’s scheduled departure date from the EU with little sign of a breakthrough in the deadlock with Brussels, analysts said property buyers and sellers were delaying their decisions amid the uncertainty. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: “With the economy largely struggling and the outlook highly uncertain, we suspect that house prices will remain soft in the near term at least.” According to the Nationwide house price index, prices fell most in London and the south-east, sliding at an annual rate of 1.7% in the capital to drag down the national average. The price of an average home elsewhere around the country is still rising, albeit at a slower pace against the backdrop of heightened political turmoil over Brexit. House prices rose most in Northern Ireland, at 3.4% on the year. Annual house price growth across the country slid from 0.6% in August to 0.2% last month, the lowest level in eight months and only marginally higher than the six-year low of 0.1% recorded in January. Analysts said continued uncertainty over Brexit would continue to weigh on house price growth across the country. Prices also remain unaffordable for many younger buyers after rising significantly over the past decade at a time of stalling wage rises. Sam Mitchell, the chief executive of online estate agent Housesimple, said: “It’s hard to say what the next month will have in store. Home movers will either be looking to strike fast to complete deals before we leave the EU, or hesitation could continue to dominate the market.” Want expert help finding your new mortgage?

128	France’s data protection watchdog has urged caution over plans to allow authorities to monitor individuals’ social media posts and purchasing activity on websites such as eBay in order to identify those committing tax fraud. The French parliament is to debate proposals for a three-year trial during which the tax office’s computer system would collect information on peoples’ lifestyles from social media accounts such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, and also monitor their activity on sites such as eBay and the French site Le Bon Coin. The idea, first suggested by the public action and accounts minister, Gérald Darmanin, is aimed at identifying gaps between a person’s declared revenue and their lifestyle, as evidenced on their social media accounts. Darmanin told French TV last year that the tax office “will be able to see that if you have numerous pictures of yourself with a luxury car while you don’t have the means to own one, then maybe your cousin or your girlfriend has lent it to you, or maybe not”. It could also potentially detect customs fraud on online sales sites. The system would also be able to check where a person is mainly residing, for example if they have declared themselves domiciled abroad but are spending most of their time in France. The data watchdog la Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL) has given written advice that the government must show “a great deal of prudence” over the plan, which raised “unprecedented questions over personal data protection”. It said the plans could amount to the mass collection of data on a “significant scale”, with information being automatically mined rather than gathered for specific, suspicious cases. The watchdog said such a massive collection of data could “significantly change individuals’ behaviour online, where they might not feel able to express themselves freely on the platforms in question”. The French government has suggested the trial would only run for three years. • This article was amended on 2 October 2019 to remove an incorrect reference to HMRC’s computer system.
129	The president of the United States openly mocked a teenage girl. After dismissing the 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg in person and earning her ire, he tweeted to his 65 million followers: “She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!” Dismissive. Sarcastic. Mocking. Utterly typical. Is anyone surprised? The Republican party has a teenage girl problem. And Thunberg knows what’s up. On Monday, she gave an impassioned and emotional speech at the climate summit in New York. “You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,” she said. “The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you. We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line.” Trump took it personally – hence, his tweet. On Tuesday, Thunberg fought back, changing her Twitter bio to read “a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future”. She’s fierce. And she’s not the only one. Just last year, a 13-year old Canadian water activist named Autumn Peltier told the United Nations it was time to “warrior up” on World Water Day. “Our water deserves to be treated as human with human rights. We need to acknowledge our waters with personhood so we can protect our waters,” the Anishinaabe girl from Wikwemikoong First Nation told the diplomats gathered in New York City. Greta Thunberg and Autumn Peltier will join the pantheon of teenage girls who changed everything. Girls like Anne Frank, a young teen when she wrote her diary. Or Joan of Arc, who led an army. Or Malala Yousafzai, who won the Nobel peace prize for her work securing education for girls in Pakistan and around the world at the age of 17. It’s no wonder men like Donald Trump are shaking in their boots. Because hell hath no fury like a teenage girl who is awake and aware and done with your bullshit. The fears of men like Trump have made mocking teenage girls a favorite American pastime. We mock their trends. In the 1980s, it was the Valley Girls. Their big hair. The way they spoke. The way they pegged their jeans and chewed their gum. The accessories they carried. Today, newspapers and parenting magazines are full of hand wringing over “VSCO girls”, the modern day Valley Girl, most of whom are in their early teens and some even younger. All the things they enjoy – Fjällräven backpacks, HydroFlasks, Birkenstocks, scrunchies. It’s all fodder for their elders’ mocking. We dismiss their water bottles, their fashion choices, the words they use. We mock their selfies (narcissists!), their clothing (cheap and too much skin!), their makeup (too much in general! Be natural!). What would happen if teenage girls were actually allowed to feel good about themselves? What if we allowed them to have their interests with no shame? They might rise up and change everything. And that scares a certain kind of man. The Fox commentator Michael Knowles called Thunberg a “mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left”. Knowles issued an apology. But he wasn’t the only one. The conservative pundit Dinesh D’Souza compared Thunberg’s image to ones used in Nazi propaganda. He posted a photo on Twitter of Thunberg, with her long braids, next to an illustration of a young woman with a similar hairstyle standing in front of a swastika flag. As the mother of a teenage girl myself, I know how hard they are to manipulate. They are strong and smart and know themselves in ways big and small. They can’t be forced by anyone – not teachers or parents – to say things they don’t mean at a school assembly, let alone on world stage. Thunberg doesn’t need anyone to push her. She pushes herself. She’s well-informed, brilliant, and unafraid to take on all the leaders in the world. Like so many other teenage girls. Like Anne Frank. Like Peltier. Like Joan of Arc. Republicans are due a reckoning. Where do they really stand on 16-year-old girls? Are they children, manipulated by George Soros and their parents, when they are saying intelligent things? Or are they women? They certainly seem to be treated as “women” when it’s time to hang with the likes of the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein or former Alabama chief justice Roy Moore, who was accused of sexual misconduct by numerous women and girls and still had many Republican supporters. It’s no wonder so many Republicans are scared of teenage girls. If teenage girls can accomplish so much and live so powerfully even as they are mocked, condescended, demeaned and shamed, imagine what they could do if we just shut up and got the hell out of their way.
130	The first time I meet Hammed Animashaun, Britain is wilting in a heatwave and he is dressed accordingly. He bowls into the bar at the Bridge theatre in London, standing 6ft 3in in a green basketball vest, black shorts, a bandana, assorted beads, rings and necklaces, and white trainers brighter than the afternoon sun. At this point, the genial 28-year-old is midway through the run of Nicholas Hytner’s blissful production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, in which he is a joyful Bottom. A friend texted him all the wonderful things people have been saying – Time Out named him “man of the match”, the Standard “a master of big-hearted comic nonsense”, the Observer “show-stealing” – but he couldn’t bring himself to look. “I had to delete the chat,” he says, sipping a Diet Coke. In Hytner’s gender-swapping spin, it is Titania who puts a love spell on Oberon, rather than the other way round, so it is Oberon who falls for Bottom. In yellow boiler suit and pert donkey ears, Animashaun laps up the affection, taking it merrily in his stride. “There’s no spell on Bottom. He could just turn around and go, ‘No thanks’, but he doesn’t. Do we have to explain that? I don’t think so. Love is love.” Most of the show’s riotous highlights are his: demanding a mobile phone from the audience before snapping a group selfie of him and his am-dram troupe, or dancing and cavorting with Oberon while their bed is pushed through the crowd. “I love looking out and seeing all those jaws on the floor,” he says. Such gleeful exhibitionism, it should be said, is par for the course for an actor who wore a Lady Gaga-style meat dress as one of the Ugly Sisters in Cinderella at the Lyric Hammersmith, rocked a pink leopard-print pantsuit and ginger beehive in The Producers at the Manchester Royal Exchange and twerked naked on screen in the debauched British comedy The Festival. Hytner emails later to enthuse about Animashaun. “He has what all the best Shakespeareans have: the ability to make it sound like he just thought of it. Here’s at least one thing he did that hadn’t occurred to me until he did it: he played the morning-after scene like he was kind of over Oberon. That he loved all the treats, the honey, the massage, the champagne, the clothes, but it wasn’t ever going to be much more than a one-night stand and that the other guy was starting to be clingy. Which I thought was hilarious, truthful and rather sad, at least for Oberon.” Animashaun tells me his performance is getting bigger all the time. “I’m still waiting for Nick to tell me to rein it in,” he laughs. “It’s like a party every night. If we didn’t have to finish, I could go on doing this for ever. One hundred per cent.” When we meet again six weeks later backstage at the National Theatre, he cuts a very different figure. He is now deep into rehearsals for “Master Harold” … and the Boys, Athol Fugard’s drama set in 1950s South Africa, in which he and Lucian Msamati play Willie and Sam, two servants whiling away an afternoon by practising ballroom dancing and shooting the breeze with Hally (Anson Boon), the teenage son of their white employers. Picking over a sandwich in his lunch break, Animashaun is relieved to have finally hung up his donkey ears for good and looks aghast when I remind him of his earlier enthusiasm for a bottomless Bottom, a never-ending Dream. “That was when I still had, like, a soul,” he says, shaking his head. “I’m exhausted. I’m done.” Though “Master Harold” … and the Boys makes further demands on his dancing skills (“My calves are killing me”), it represents a change of tempo, swapping the party atmosphere of Shakespeare’s comedy for the simmering tensions of this politically charged three-hander. “Willie is extremely flawed and that’s where the challenges are coming from. He doesn’t say an awful lot but he communicates so much in the choices he makes physically. The way he treats Hally with respect compared to how he treats women. He doesn’t see the problem – when women mess up, you beat them, right? It’s a lot easier in his society to attack a black woman than to attack a white man. It’s the food chain: he chooses the weaker animal.” Animashaun remembers going to the library in Tower Hamlets, London, as a child to read up on apartheid. “I was so shocked. I grew up in an area where all you saw was different sorts of people, and that was amazing. I never had any racism directed at me until I was older, but, even at that young age, I knew it wasn’t right.” I ask where the racism came from. “It’s happened a few times in the industry in quite subtle ways. You hear stories or someone will say directly, ‘The only reason you got this job is cos you’re black.’ And then you go, ‘Wait. That’s racist.’” He has also experienced hostility outside work. “You get people hurling things, screaming things. That was a long time ago. But look at today’s world. I was on a train and this guy was sitting beside me watching a Tommy Robinson video. That’s how open everyone is about it right now.” He scans the walls, momentarily lost for words. “What could I say to him? I wouldn’t know where to start.” He’s in no doubt about where the rise in intolerance has come from. “It’s the leaders. One hundred per cent. When you’ve got a prime minister saying women in burqas look like bank robbers and letterboxes, and a president mocking disability and calling Mexicans rapists, then it allows people to think, ‘Well, if they can say that stuff, I definitely can.’” He was thrilled to see the Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi take the prime minister to task over his use of derogatory language. What would he say to Boris Johnson if he got the chance? “Bro, apologise.” The question of why this is a pertinent time to stage “Master Harold” … and the Boys barely needs answering. “The play isn’t just about race. It’s also about love and friendship, and today those things are more important than ever. Sam has this amazing speech about how ballroom dancers don’t bump into one another because everyone’s doing the right steps. If everyone thought about love and acceptance, there wouldn’t be any bumping. Hally isn’t the problem; it’s his society. We’ve got kids growing up saying hateful things because of the society they’re being raised in. How about if we told them that anyone could be whoever they want to be and still be regarded as a person of relevance and importance?” Theatre has played a big role in building Animashaun’s own self-esteem. He was doing poorly at school when his drama teacher encouraged his mother to sign him up to the Half Moon Children’s Theatre in Limehouse, telling her: “He’ll thrive.” And he did. He was at the National in 2016 in Rufus Norris’s staging of The Threepenny Opera and Michael Longhurst’s spectacular revival of Amadeus, being flirted with by Olivia Colman in the Channel 4 comedy Flowers and turning up in BBC3’s Pls Like as a YouTuber whose anti-aggression campaign is called Let’s Punch Violence in the Head and Break Its Jaw. His professional highlight so far, though, was the original production of Barber Shop Chronicles, the breakneck compendium of stories of black male life from across the globe. “I got very emotional gazing out from the stage each night and seeing young men in the audience who looked just like me, who know what it’s like to be a young black man in this country. That show was for the culture.” Indeed, Animashaun’s appeal is instant and wide-ranging, as Hytner explains: “The audience sees him and they think, ‘He’s our guy.’ This is a gift that can’t be taught or faked. I predict an immense career. I imagine he could play more or less anything.” Just so long as he doesn’t have to see himself doing it. He sat through the NT Live broadcast of Amadeus “with one eye closed” and won’t be watching A Midsummer Night’s Dream when it reaches cinemas this month. “Oh my gosh,” he grimaces. “No one needs to see this face on the big screen.” But they do. And they will. One hundred per cent. • “Master Harold” … and the Boys is at the National Theatre, London, until 17 December. A Midsummer Night’s Dream is broadcast in cinemas by NT Live from 17 October.
131	On 22 October, it will be 100 years since the birth of Doris Lessing. That’s a good reason to revisit the work of the award winning British-Zimbabwean novelist here on the Reading group. In a career spanning more than 50 years, Lessing wrote dozens of works of fiction and biography, in many different genres and moods, and was shortlisted for – and won – most of the major literary awards in Europe. She won the Nobel prize in literature in 2007, when the Swedish Academy described her as “that epicist of the female experience, who with scepticism, fire and visionary power has subjected a divided civilisation to scrutiny”. The word “epicist” means “epic poet”, which possibly fits Lessing in the broader sense of the term, even if the poetry she wrote had a quieter impact than her novels. At 88, Lessing was the oldest author to receive the honour. She was also one of the most nonplussed. “Oh Christ,” she said when a reporter on her doorstep told her she’d won. On further reflection she said: “I’m sure you’d like some uplifting remarks of some kind … It’s been going on now for 30 years, one can get more excited … I’ve won all the prizes in Europe – every bloody one. I’m delighted to have won them all. The whole lot.” In 2007, Robert McCrum saluted her in the Observer as a writer “who has dedicated her long life and impressive body of work to the tireless and unflinching exploration of man’s (and woman’s) place in the world, together with issues of race, gender and social justice. This prize finally acknowledges what has been true for at least 40 years: that she is one of the most important literary voices of her generation.” McCrum noted that her work was mainly read by people over the age of 35. Presumably, those readers are now over 47. It’s hard to tell how many younger readers have been picking her up since. I myself read The Grass Is Singing, first published in 1950, around the time of the Nobel announcement and promised to read “more Lessing”. It’s not just the appalling joke that makes me redden but that I haven’t read any of her books since. This is a good chance, for me anyway, to put that right and celebrate this astonishing writer. The only question is which book to read. Her work includes furious takedowns of colonialism and apartheid, explorations of female inner space such as in The Golden Notebook and outer space in books like Canopus in Argos. Lessing poured scorn on the idea that she could be pigeonholed. She had been given “every conceivable label. I started off as a writer about the colour bar, and then I was a communist, then a feminist, then a mystic.’ And now? What I always was. Just the same.” Her extensive bibliography may be one reason why her work so impressed the Nobel committee. Let’s take a vote and choose the book that is most often nominated in the comments below as this month’s Reading group choice. First a caution: an impressive number of those books remain in print, but not all of them. If you do want to choose one of the less famous novels, make sure it is widely available so as many people as possible can take part. As always, all other ideas and points for discussion are welcome.
132	The body of mayoral candidate Karina García was found shot and incinerated in her car in the Cauca department of southern Colombia, on 1 September. For weeks, García had reported receiving threats and asked the government for increased protection during campaigning for the local and departmental elections at the end of the month. Since the political race officially began, seven candidates have been murdered around the country. These elections will be the first to take place since the historic signing of a peace accord between the Farc rebels and the Colombian government in 2016, ending more than 50 years of war. The assassinations, attacks and threats against candidates take place amid concerns about increasing violence in Colombia. Some analysts attribute the killings to armed groups looking to gain territorial authority and the control of the illegal drugs trade. Those candidates who support the implementation of the peace process, including the eradication or substitution of coca crops, risk becoming targets. Amid the rising tide of violence, national women’s organisations are voicing concerns that attacks on female political candidates are shaped by gender dynamics. Carolina Mosquera, researcher at feminist organisation Sisma Mujer, said women are being targeted both for running as candidates, and for disturbing the patriarchal order. “Male candidates are being attacked, but not for gendered reasons – not because they are men.” Irina Cuesta, a researcher at thinktank Fundación Ideas para la Paz, told the Guardian: “Our research has found that when women leaders are attacked, it’s through threats to their family members, sexual violence, and generalised warnings against the work they do. The contents of the threats are openly sexist and question [women’s] political processes more generally.” She describes a wave of femicides that took place in Puerto Asís, Putumayo, earlier this year. Among victims were women who planned to register as candidates in the coming elections. “There is a political message behind these aggressions against women leaders and candidates, particularly in the territories where stereotypes and tolerance to gender-based violence are useful tools for illegal armed actors.” María Emilsen Angulo is running to be the mayor of Tumaco, a port town on Colombia’s Pacific coast notorious for violence, drug-smuggling and the presence of armed groups. In May, Angulo was approached by a group of armed men who told her to end her political campaign. “I was worried, because I know how things work around here, but I continued cautiously. The second time they came to me, it was much more vulgar, crueller,” she says, in her campaign office in the centre of Tumaco. “They threatened me and told me that they know where my daughter is, where my husband is, that they know where we travel and how we move, and if something happened, it would be my fault.” She and her team decided to pull out of the running, but later surprised the community by officially registering again. “Women need to keep advancing to get access to the spaces that we still can’t reach. There should be an equality when it comes to governing this country, there should be more women counsellors, representatives, governors, mayors.” She has hired private security, but remains fearful. “When you launch a political campaign, you put your life at risk, your family at risk,” she says. “I feel that there are no guarantees for my safety. I want to do my job, but there are stronger interests out there.” Ten years ago, Laura Montoya nearly died after being attacked by a paramilitary group while in the office of her radio station. A journalist and activist for many years, she is now running for a seat in the departmental assembly of Putumayo, a southern province bordering Ecuador and Peru. In 2018, Montoya received a death threat via an anonymous phone call, and earlier this year her name appeared on a menacing pamphlet signed by a paramilitary group. Despite ongoing fears for her safety, she decided to launch a political campaign. “Women are gaining ground, but we still have further to go, and this has to begin from above, with policies that can represent real changes,” she says. “There is a gendered issue here. There is a deep-rooted machismo. I work alongside men who are involved in the same activism and they haven’t received the threats that I have.” Her department, Putumayo, continues to be one of the top coca-growing parts of the country, and armed groups are once again trying to gain control of the illicit trade. When it comes to women running for office in this context, Montoya is clear: “Women have become more empowered, but [participation] is still lacking because of the fear, the lack of guarantees for their security.” According to 2011 law, each party’s electoral list must include 30% women. Despite this, only 12% of all mayors in the country are women. Ana Güezmes García, the Representative for UN Women in Colombia, said “one of the biggest challenges is women’s participation at the local level”. “To consolidate the peace process, we need to invest in women … and create a culture of security for them,” she added. “Gendered violence is based in hatred. The level of murders and extreme violence we have seen in Colombia is very worrying and requires a strengthened response from all of the institutions. It’s the community leaders who face the biggest risks of threats and violence, which is why it’s extremely important that what we saw happen in Cauca mobilises everyone to respond, investigate and sanction what happened.” During her campaign, Karina García’s political slogan was: “One woman, one hope”. “She wanted to bring a new sort of leadership to Suárez [her municipality],” says Mosquera, “but when so few women are willing to risk entering electoral politics and then they see events like this, the message becomes extremely clear: don’t participate or this could happen to you too.”
133	Agustín Creevy has described England as boring and claimed that the World Cup match on Saturday will be “like a war”. The hooker, who has captained Argentina 49 times, spent two seasons in the Premiership with Worcester and he believes that gives him inside knowledge on the Pumas’ opponents this weekend. “I think sometimes [their structure] is boring but it’s good for England, and it works,” Creevy said. “I spent a lot of time there and it was great. I improved a lot in the way I see rugby, and I understand a lot about how the England boys see rugby. They are really structured. “Maybe my play in Worcester helped [me] to see the way it will come on Saturday. They always play the same way in history. They are really structured and that for me is really good. I improved a lot.” Creevy relinquished the Argentina captaincy after four years in 2018 but he remains one of the most feared hookers in world rugby. He has faced England five times and lost on each occasion – the Pumas have not won in their past nine meetings since their 2009 victory – but he is relishing the challenge that awaits. “Saturday is going to be like a war, it’s like a final for us,” said Creevy, who arrived at Worcester in 2013. “I think the battle with the forwards will be the game. We need to win the scrum, win the lineout, win the maul, win the contact, the breakdown. “When we put on this shirt we feel something different. It’s our country, our family, my club. We play together, the group is really bonded. That is different to different teams. We love each other, and I think that is different to other teams. We are friends, we are brothers, inside and outside the field.” Argentina are traditionally known for a strong set piece being the bedrock of their game. Their scrum was among the most disappointing aspects of a poor Rugby Championship this summer, but was vastly improved in their narrow opening defeat by France. “We trained a lot. Our skills in the scrums and the mentality, we worked a lot in that,” Creevy said. “I think we are improving a lot in the scrum and we feel good, but we need to continue. The England scrum is really good.” Creevy is vying for selection in the No 2 jersey with Julián Montoya, who scored a hat-trick and was named man of the match in the win against Tonga on Saturday. But the 34-year-old is certain to be part of the matchday squad and win his 88th international cap. “I’m really proud. I can’t explain with words, and in English it’s really difficult. I’m really proud to get 88 games with this shirt. I never imagined that, it’s a dream for me. I’m really happy. I think about my club, family, a lot of things I did and that was hard. Now I think about it and say it was really great.”
134	British manufacturers have ramped up their stockpiling efforts ahead of the new Brexit deadline at the end of the month, amid growing concerns over disruption to the UK economy. According to IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips), UK factory output was boosted in September by firms rushing to purchase goods and materials to avoid any potential border delays. Despite the increase in stockpiling activity after a lull in activity over the summer, the survey showed that factory output fell for the fifth-month in a row, the longest downturn since the last recession in 2009. The new rush to build up supplies ahead of Brexit helped to lift the IHS Markit/Cips manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) to 48.3 in September from a six-and-a-half-year low of 47.4 in August. However, it remains below the 50.0 mark that separates growth from contraction. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said: “The impact of such Brexit-related stock building was dwarfed by weakening demand for other customers, due in part to clients routing supply chains away from the UK.” Manufacturing output across the developed the world has slumped in recent months amid the continuing US-China trade war, which has sapped business investment and depressed export demand. Manufacturing output in the eurozone has dropped to the lowest levels in seven years, dragging major countries such as Italy and Germany to the brink of recession. In a sign of the continuing downturn in UK manufacturing, firms said that output, new orders, and export business all fell in September. Employment levels also fell at the fastest pace in six years, with around 8,000 jobs lost in September, up from around 6,000 in August. Against a backdrop of mounting political turmoil in recent months, UK firms have begun redoubling their efforts to prepare for a potentially damaging no-deal Brexit at the end of October. Greggs, the high street bakery chain, said on Tuesday it is taking steps to build up stocks of key ingredients and equipment that could be affected. It has rented warehouse space and will begin stockpiling some longer-life products sourced from Europe, such as bacon and tuna. It has also begun sourcing all its cheese and most of its sugar in the UK to avoid potential disruption. Greggs chief executive, Roger Whiteside, said the company would not be able to replace delicate foodstuffs such as tomatoes and lettuce and would have to switch to alternatives or stop selling products which used items held up by problems at ports. Some firms have also started stockpiling beer, wine and spirits to keep the alcohol flowing at Christmas. Analysts have warned that the Brexit deadline comes as warehousing activity ramps up ahead of the festive season, making planning for both events harder for businesses. Firms across the UK had rushed to stockpile before the original Brexit deadline on 29 March, providing a boost to economic growth earlier this year. Companies then opted to run down supplies after Theresa May delayed the deadline until the end of October, dragging down economic output, taking Britain to the brink of recession. James Smith, an economist at the Dutch bank ING, said the boost was unlikely to be as significant the second time around, adding: “Inventory levels are still perceived to be fairly high, but also warehousing space is becoming more constrained given the close proximity to Black Friday and Christmas.”
135	There is a clear link between the provocative language used by ministers and other politicians and the increase of threats to public figures. Everyone knows it, which is why politicians of every stripe have asked urgent questions in parliament that all focused on Boris Johnson’s use of inflammatory language as a deliberate strategy. Instead of answering them, junior minister Kevin Foster shrugged off the concerns, and relentlessly bridged back to what has become the Tory party conference motto: “get Brexit done”. Only after that, we are told, will the hate and the division in our country subside, as if an election and a promised spending splurge could repair the damage that’s been done to our public square over three years. Civil servants don’t believe a word of it. A nasty, no-deal Brexit followed by an even nastier “people v parliament” election campaign will further imperil not just our public figures but our institutions too, with dire consequences for public services over the coming months. I see three main threats. First, Dominic Cummings. Remember what first triggered alarms about his appointment? He is a self-confessed shock doctor whose goals reach beyond Brexit and the winning of the next general election. Brexit’s dark lord has longer-term plans to change the whole way the business of government is delivered. The last few weeks of havoc provide us with ample evidence to suppose that his best hope for doing that starts with a disorientated, destabilised civil service. That is deeply connected to the second reason: the civil service’s no-deal planning leaders have been leaving in droves. Matthew Coats is the latest to resign – reporting directly to Michael Gove, he was the director-general of the Department for Brexit’s border delivery group, in charge of delivering “frictionless borders”. That magical phrase may have something to do with his departure, which follows the self-defenestration of similarly senior no-deal planning figures such as Coats’ former boss, Karen Wheeler, who resigned in June, and Tim Shinner, director of policy and delivery coordination. Philip Rycroft, the department’s permanent secretary retired at the end of March after little more than a year at the helm. What’s the matter with these civil servants? Don’t they believe in Brexit? If they do, they shouldn’t. They are professionals whose task is to carry out government policies through plans built on logic and evidence, not Orwellian doublethink. But there is cause for concern: I recently came across a job description for a senior no-deal planning role in a Brexit-facing department – it told applicants that essential attributes were an “ability to handle complexity and ambiguity”. I’m the first to recognise that Operation Yellowhammer has actually done a lot to put in place plans for no-deal Brexit mitigation, even if it’s clear that they won’t be nearly enough. But more recent plans are disintegrating before our eyes. For example, assurances from the health secretary, Matt Hancock, about the flow of medicines were only last week contradicted by the National Audit Office. The ink was barely dry on Johnson’s press release about his £3bn investment in 40 hospitals before health experts found serious holes in the proposals. And Department for Education ministers are facing questions over the very existence of its no-deal Brexit planning. Most of all, the government still refuses to be honest about the true cost of a no-deal Brexit. The third threat to our public institutions is the looming constitutional crisis brought about by the prime minister’s determination to evade the provisions of the Benn Act (requesting a Brexit extension from the EU). This places civil servants in a unique quandary. As civil service union bosses have pointed out several times, we will soon be caught in the no-man’s land between violating our civil service code obligations to obey ministers, and breaking the law by defying the will of parliament. That way lies paralysis. That’s why we need Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary and the head of the civil service to mitigate the worst of the damage while he still can. He’s the government’s most senior non-political adviser and oversees, among other things, the ministerial code that governs the conduct of cabinet ministers, and the prime minister himself. He also may be the person who ends up asking the EU for a Brexit extension. Mark is a busy man. Just in the last couple of weeks, he has been asked to investigate the prime minister’s alleged sexual misconduct, as well as the claims that the Johnson’s backers will benefit from a no-deal Brexit. He is currently on a “listening tour”, according to his leaked letter to senior civil servants, which may explain why he’s been a bit quiet lately. But, whether in private or public, we need Mark to quickly take action – he alone has the mandate to ensure the civil service is in one piece for whatever happens after 31 October. He can’t have missed Nigel Farage’s appalling exclamation about taking a knife to “non-neutral civil servants”. Like all civil servants, Mark’s job is not to be neutral, it is to be truthful. In the meantime, civil servants like me have to stay anonymous – we can’t go on the Today programme to explain how a no-deal Brexit is going to be hard enough without worrying about how the courts, a future Brexit inquiry or angry hi-vis mobs will come after us. We aren’t traitors or remoaners – we just want to get on with our jobs. • The civil servant works in a Whitehall department and was part of Operation Yellowhammer
136	This is a suit I wore while filming On Becoming a God in Central Florida. The guy I play, Travis Stubbs, works in an office cubicle in the early 90s. He is stuck in a job he hates and not happy about where he is in life, but he has aspirations. He wants to look like a successful businessman but he doesn’t have much style or taste. Bad style in the early 90s gives you a plethora of horrible, horrible outfits. It was one of my favourite characters to create in terms of the look and the hair. It’s always fun when you create a character who looks different from the way they feel. He has bought into a pyramid scheme, so in order to recruit more people he wants to look important and successful. We had a lot of fun putting together some ostentatious and quite tacky outfits, culminating in a very ill-fitting tuxedo. Going to costume fittings is always instrumental, for me, in finding the character. I spend hours thinking: “What kind of shoe would this guy wear? What kind of jacket?” It’s always a collaboration between me and the costume designer and I will agonise over an outfit – if I find a great pair of shoes, but they are slightly the wrong colour, that can bother me a lot. In my personal life, I don’t pay much attention to what I wear – it’s the other end of the spectrum and I like to just switch off. I don’t have the energy to spend more than two minutes thinking about it in the morning and so I pretty much wear the same thing every day. That is not to say I’m not interested in clothes – it can be fun to dress up for an event – but that’s a special occasion. I never “put together an outfit” if I’m just running around New York or Stockholm. I have always been allergic to clothes that are not comfortable – as much as I love the look of a wool sweater, I can’t wear them because they’re too itchy. I gravitate towards soft fabrics.

137	When celebrities become guest editors of corporate social media accounts, it usually results in dozens of pouting selfies. For this reason, Prince Harry’s takeover of the National Geographic Instagram account to encourage people to “look up” and get lost in the beauty of trees is a weirdly enticing concept. On Monday, the Duke of Sussex curated a set of images of forest canopies each taken by National Geographic photographers, which went out to the publication’s 123 million followers. The idea was to highlight the importance of conservation while spotlighting the Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy campaign, which will result in two national parks being created in South Africa, where Harry is touring. As part of the campaign, 50 countries have either dedicated indigenous forest for conservation or committed to planting millions of new trees to combat climate change. One image shows Harry flat on his backside, taking a photo of an imposing South African baobab tree, which can live for more than 1,000 years and, due to its size, even sustain its own ecosystem. The Duke has captured its spindly branches with a finesse rewarded by 412,000 likes. The other photographs, which include a red-leafed autumnal British tree and the distinctive strangler fig, with its branches knotted together like a spider’s web, are strikingly beautiful. It is a shame, though, that the accompanying captions – in which Harry describes how the strangler fig’s twisty barks helped it earn its name or why the red leaves of autumn in the UK are special – are so alarmingly redolent of a basic Wikipedia search. A few more details on why these trees are so ecologically important might have been a good idea. Fortunately, the National Geographic’s enthusiastic readers don’t seem to mind: one of the top-rated comments is from rappers Cypress Hill, whose use of the tree emoji may allude to sparking up debate about a very different kind of plant. Thanks to its snappy hashtag (#LookingUp) and hundreds of thousands of likes, the campaign will at least encourage Instagram users to find out more about the potential of planting trees. New research predicts that a worldwide planting programme could have a “mind-blowing” effect by removing as many as two-thirds of all the emissions that humans currently pump into the atmosphere. It argues that with 1.7bn hectares of treeless land available, which is roughly the same size as the US and China combined, around 1.2tn native tree saplings could be naturally grown. Suddenly, Harry liking trees seems kind of cool. Critics will surely point to the hypocrisy of Harry fronting an eco-friendly campaign while riding around in a private jet. Nonetheless, in encouraging the public to regard trees as holy beings, rather than disposable wood, his takeover of the National Geographic’s Instagram spotlights the important role these natural giants can play in preserving the future of our planet. Prince Charles, infamously once revealed how he likes to talk to his plants, but Harry’s fascination with trees appears less like a midlife crisis and more like a savvy social media-friendly way to address global warming. After weeks of unflattering headlines about his and Meghan’s travelling habits, Harry’s tree-hugging won’t do much to get them back on side, but in terms of positioning the Duke of Sussex as, well, the Green Prince, it looks like mission accomplished.
138	Harland and Wolff, the Belfast shipyard that built the Titanic, has been saved from closure after a London-based energy company stepped in with a £6m rescue deal. The historic shipyard, which also built the HMS Belfast cruiser now permanently moored on the Thames as a museum, went into administration in August after its Norwegian parent company collapsed. But InfraStrata, whose main project is building the Islandmagee underground gas storage plant off the coast of Country Antrim, said it planned to retain the 79 workers still employed at the yard and could increase the workforce to 400. The Unite union praised the company’s workers for fighting to keep it alive, including a nine-week sit-in protest that was designed to raise awareness about its plight. Unite’s assistant general secretary for manufacturing, Steve Turner, said: “I always knew that this incredible workforce would fight for and win the future that this community wholeheartedly deserves. They have stood strong and resolute while others were too ready to throw in the towel. “Now, we have work to do. We have a shipyard to get back up and running to its full potential.” InfraStrata’s chief executive, John Wood, said buying Harland and Wolff would cut the cost of work on Islandmagee by up to 15%. This is because owning the shipyard will allow the company to build steel pipework and modules in Belfast and bring them in by barge, rather than buying parts from abroad and building them on site. “It makes more sense to do it locally and keeps our pledge to the local community to keep as much work in Northern Ireland as we possibly could,” he said. “Particularly with Brexit, this gives us a lot more comfort in the supply chain to develop the project.” The yard will also contribute to the company’s plans for a floating gas storage facility. The company plans to increase the size of the workforce by several hundred over the next five years, it said in a statement to the Aim junior stock market. “Harland and Wolff is a landmark asset and its reputation as one of the finest multipurpose fabrication facilities in Europe is testament to its highly skilled team in Belfast,” said Wood. The InfraStrata boss said he had worked as an engineering officer on board the Canberra, a ship built by Harland and Wolff. “I know how well built the ship was, which is testament to the quality of work here in Belfast,” he said. Wood added that the company hopes to rehire some of the staff who took voluntary redundancy when Harland and Wolff went into administration, as well as staff who lost their jobs in the collapse of nearby Wrightbus. While the yard will initially make pipework and steel modules for the Islandmagee gas storage plant, which involves compressing gas for storage 1,500m below the sea floor in salt beds, Wood said it could also return to shipbuilding.
139	The fight against plastic waste, often depicted by swathes of rubbish bobbing in the world’s rivers and oceans, hasn’t always been front and centre in people’s minds. At the Museum of Design in Plastics, part of the Arts University Bournemouth, curator Louise Dennis says disposability was once seen as a sign of wealth and cleanliness. “Consumers were encouraged to use disposable products for their efficiency and to avoid contamination,” she says. “[But] plastics are vilified for having a long life when they are in the wrong place. One of plastic’s key features, its lightness, could actually be its downfall. It can be seen floating in water, blowing in the wind and caught in trees as litter.” Public opinion about plastic started to shift in the 1970s and 80s, particularly after the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held in Stockholm in 1972, the first to focus on international environmental issues. Interest has since grown significantly – a recent survey (pdf) found 87% of Europeans are concerned about the impact of plastic waste and almost all (94%) say industry and retailers should try to reduce packaging and design products to ease recycling. In Europe alone, 58m tonnes of plastic are created every year, of which an estimated 15.88m tonnes, or 31kg per person, becomes packaging waste. Only 40% of this is recycled. In an effort to boost that percentage, it’s composite materials (where more than one material has been bonded together) that prove to be the most problematic. In practice, separating those materials for further recycling often does not occur. So such packaging is sent to landfill, or burned for energy. But with countries including China, Malaysia and Vietnam banning waste imports, and Thailand set to do the same by 2021, it’s imperative a solution is found for Europe’s rapidly increasing piles of discarded packaging. Many are working towards achieving an ideal known as the circular economy – a regenerative model that seeks to minimise resource input and waste by slowing, closing and narrowing material and energy loops. “It’s not new,” says Dr Pauline Deutz, co-lead of the Plastics Collaboratory at the University of Hull. “One problem is we don’t know exactly what the end goal is. You can say we want to be circular but there are so many different ways you might [do that]. The principle is that you design things looking ahead (and that doesn’t really happen now so that would be a big, big step) … but that still leaves many different variables.” At Henkel, that’s a challenge Dennis Bankmann is working on. He’s one of the company’s global business developers for the circular economy, focusing on adhesives for packaging and consumer goods: a remit that covers items such as cardboard boxes, bottles for drinks, yoghurt pots and labels, as well as furniture products in the construction industry, nappies, and shoes. It’s a broad range of materials – paper, plastics, glass, metals and wood – “all of which have or hopefully will soon have their own recycling systems and streams,” says Bankmann, although he admits there are challenges to achieving that goal. “This is something that no single stakeholder or entity company, or even country, can solve on their own ... you need a broad alignment to make the whole concept work.” Part of that collaborative thinking has involved working with Saperatec, a German startup that has devised a process to break down the layer structure in composite items without degrading or changing them, including cardboard, plastic and aluminium. Founded by Dr Sebastian Kernbaumin 2011, the company uses a separation liquid to penetrate between multiple layers, before washing, sorting and drying the materials, which are then sold. It’s already been used on products including drinks cartons, lithium-ion batteries, car glass, and packaging material. As an adhesives manufacturer, Henkel worked with Saperatec to optimise its products for flexible packaging material, particularly items for coffee pouches and fruit juice pouches that include two types of plastics and a thin layer of aluminium foil. This included working together to identify the best adhesive to use for that process. “This kind of separation can be done very effectively, very completely, very efficiently,” says Bankmann. “It’s a good example of how you need different stakeholders to work together.” Henkel has also been in discussions with recyclers and companies in other sectors who buy recycled materials, and was one of the founding members of CEFLEX, a European consortium that aims to promote circular economy deliverables in flexible packaging. “This really raises the opportunity,” Bankmann says. “Because there are so many multinationals here that if we come to a solution we have the opportunity to implement that very widely, geographically … for us, it’s the clarity and harmonisation that has the biggest impact … [so we can] start providing solutions.” Meaningful change has to happen at scale, Deutz agrees, although she believes governments have a role to play in achieving that shift. “You do need companies to take action, but to have enough companies taking enough action, you need regulation as well.” In May 2019, MEPs called for all plastic packaging waste to be recyclable by 2030, and backed measures to ban the most common single-use plastics (including cotton bud sticks, plastic cutlery and drinking straws). “I would say overall we are at a beginning,” adds Bankmann. “And I believe we will not stop at packaging. In coming to a more sustainable world, we cannot stop at packaging. More and more types of things we produce will come into scope … essentially every item from our daily life needs to become part of the circular economy.”
140	By a strange chance it is currently possible to see two radically different adaptations of incomplete Jane Austen novels. Laura Wade’s version of The Watsons, abandoned by Austen after the death of her father in 1805, has moved triumphantly from Chichester to London’s Menier Chocolate Factory. Meanwhile an eight-part extension of Sanditon, on which Austen was forced to stop work in 1817 because of illness, occupies a prime-time Sunday night slot on ITV. Seeing the two works in conjunction tells us a lot about the challenges of adapting Austen and about the nature of stage and TV drama. Wade takes a bold approach to adapting Austen. She faithfully sets up the dilemma posed by what little we have of The Watsons: which of three potential suitors should the lively, witty but impoverished Emma Watson choose? A diffident aristo, a sententious parson or a suave bounder? Having established the situation, Wade then springs a surprise – and it is difficult not to give part of the game away – by introducing herself, as the adapter, into the action. What follows is a dazzling meditation on any number of topics: on Austen’s own preferred outcome, on the afterlife of literary creations, on the inherent conflict between invented characters and the writer who brings them into existence. At what point, Wade asks, does a character acquire such independent vitality that it starts to dictate action? Does Austen write Elizabeth Bennet or does Elizabeth Bennet, to some extent, write Austen? Sanditon, adapted by Andrew Davies and a team of writers, inevitably takes a different tack. For a start, the unfinished novel shows Austen, at the end of her life, opening up new territory. She was writing about the early 19th-century vogue for seaside resorts and the commercial hazards, burgeoning possibilities and social mobility this involved. TV seizes on this to show Sanditon being built and to follow the fortunes of the speculating Tom Parker, the disdainful Lady Denham (a wonderful Anne Reid) and the highly practical Charlotte Heywood. Ideas are niftily pinched from other Austen novels as a way of developing plot. We’re told of the young Catherine Morland in Northanger Abbey that she “greatly preferred cricket not merely to dolls” but to all other childish amusements. So one episode of Sanditon was almost entirely taken up by a cricket match in which Charlotte rescued the toffs’ team from humiliating defeat by a gang of resentfully unpaid workers. Sanditon makes an entertaining addition to the Austen canon even if the hint of oral sex in the first episode might have had dedicated Janeites reaching for the smelling salts. While Sanditon is bound by the linear conventions of TV classic drama, Wade’s version of The Watsons plays with dramatic form, poses a whole series of questions about the nature of drama and fiction, and even makes glancing topical points: “We don’t need experts,” Emma cries at one point, “we have hearts, we have minds!” Television can do all manner of things that the stage can’t. But, for all its merits, Sanditon basically offers a decorative speculation about what might have happened next in Austen’s imagined resort. The Watsons, taking advantage of the theatre’s capacity for risk, digs much deeper to question the very nature of adaptation and to ask who actually “owns” a fictional character. I accept that Sanditon is Sunday-night viewing and The Watsons is for a theatrical minority but when, if ever, will television show the same freedom to experiment? • The Watsons is at the Menier Chocolate Factory, London, until 16 November. Sanditon is on ITV at 9pm on Sundays; catch up with past episodes on ITV Hub.
141	A pair of sleek white apartment blocks rise above the trees of Windsor Great Park. Their sharp concrete balconies and horizontal strip windows embody all the promise of modernity, just a stone’s throw from the spires of Eton and the turrets of Windsor Castle. As the developers of the complex put it in 1935, this was to be “the housing method of the future”, a place kitted out with all the latest mod cons: tennis and squash courts, swimming pool, skittle alley, Turkish bath and cinema room. With the option of housemaid service, as well as stabling for horses alongside the garage, it was billed as a place “for those who care for the country, whose manner of living is intelligent, and whose social standards are high”. The problem was, you had to like modern architecture, too – and most people in Britain didn’t. Isokon 3, this heady vision for Windsor designed by Bauhaus maestro Walter Gropius, never happened because the British public wasn’t ready for it. Despite the best efforts of its developer, Jack Pritchard, who received the blessing of King George V for the buildings to be erected overlooking his castle, there simply wasn’t enough demand for this new functionalist, wipe-clean world, freshly imported from the continent. Despite seductive brochures offering “all the amenities of living that are to be found in a really comfortable country house … at a price which is very much less than the cost of living in a country house of your own”, the project never got off the ground. Neither did a similar Gropius-designed scheme in Birmingham. The delicate watercolour renderings and sales brochure are all that remain of the dream, now on show at the RIBA in a new exhibition, Beyond Bauhaus: Modernism in Britain 1933–66, marking the centenary of the radical German art school and its impact on British architecture. The show casts a necessarily broad net, given our introverted island wasn’t particularly receptive to the radical cocktail of machine-made functionalism, abstraction and socialism. Gropius was joined in London by artist László Moholy-Nagy and designer Marcel Breuer for just three years, taking refuge from Nazi Germany in the first (and only) Isokon apartment building in Hampstead, before they all moved on in 1937. It is painfully symbolic that the first items in the exhibition are the menu cards from their farewell dinners, and a photograph of them happily leaving Britain for the US. The Guardian’s own contemporary coverage is also telling. In a 1930 interview with Gropius (spelt with a lower-case “g” throughout the article, because “various modern architects and artists do not use capital letters”), he remarks that “only in England and Spain has this architectural style few adherents”. The newspaper’s scientific correspondent reported: “He thinks the Americans will develop this style of modern architecture most successfully. They are not so individualistically conservative as Western Europeans.” Gropius was being diplomatic. Later, he would write of Britain as a “land of fog and emotional nightmares”. Still, the RIBA’s curators have done their best to suggest that the Bauhäuslers had a good time here, gave many lectures and made lots of influential friends. They’ve had a thorough rummage through their copious archives and put together an illuminating show that not only documents the little-known output (built and unbuilt) of the Bauhaus three on these shores, but also traces the evolution of Britain’s own homegrown brand of modernity. Along with Gropius’s unrealised plans for Windsor, another highlight is Marcel Breuer’s “Garden City of the Future”, a utopian scheme he produced for the Ideal Home Exhibition in 1936, in collaboration with FRS Yorke, which looks like the result of Ebenezer Howard on acid. Gone are the garden city movement’s familiar arts-and-craftsy cottages arranged along radial avenues; instead, we find gigantic concrete ziggurat shopping centres, Y-shaped apartment blocks and curious amoebic pavilions. It was a high-density, mixed-use urban plan designed, said the architects, so that “a man can spend, in the open air, at rest or sport, the hour he must at present waste in travel to or from his work”. It duly inspired furious letters to the Telegraph, along the lines of “this isn’t British”, but it also provided a fertile source for others to mine. The outward-stepping courtyard shopping building, supported by great angled buttresses, clearly influenced the form of James Stirling’s 1966 project for Queen’s College in Oxford, while Breuer would go on to recycle a number of the ideas in later buildings, from France to Argentina. Elsewhere, we see how the hard lines and sharp corners of the Bauhaus style were softened by their arrival on British soil. Another fascinating yet little-known Breuer project is the Gane Pavilion, once again designed with FRS Yorke, for the Royal Agricultural Show in Bristol in 1936. Looking more like a Californian Case Study House from the 1950s, it incorporated massive masonry walls made of roughly squared Cotswold stone, topped with a projecting flat roof, enclosing a free-flowing domestic interior lined with plywood. It was a kind of rustic Bauhaus, the utilitarian ideology safely wrapped in a cosy blanket of rural Englishness, with even a nod to our national obsession of being “in keeping”. Practical constraints had unexpected aesthetic impacts, too. The widespread lack of central heating in British homes in the 1930s prompted Breuer to move away from the tubular steel furniture designs that he had developed at the Bauhaus and adopt the warmer potentials of wood. “Plywood ahoy!” he wrote in a letter to Gropius as he left Germany for England, anticipating the furniture designs he would produce for Isokon, including the famous Long Chair and a plywood dining table, both of which have spawned countless imitations since. Similarly, Gropius’s Wood House in Kent, built with Maxwell Fry in 1937, an oak-framed building clad in cedar boarding, anticipates the house he would go on to build for himself in Massachusetts, and presages the kind of timber-clad suburban modernism that would later take root in various aspirational corners of leafy England. But, in the main, the exhibition gives the impression that we didn’t get a grip on what the Bauhaus evangelists were preaching until long after they’d left. Gropius’s Impington College in Cambridgeshire, built in 1939, by which time he was ensconced at Harvard, is perhaps the most important single work in this regard. Separating out the various components of the building in the landscape, with classrooms arranged to maximise daylight, it would go on to inspire the nature of most British state schools of the postwar era. There is a good section on the role of the county architects in developing these ideas, with a particular focus on the pioneering Hertfordshire schools programme. It highlights Mary Crowley’s designs for the first school in Cheshunt in 1949, and the evolution of the standardised prefabricated system, which would be adopted across the country by the 70s – finally realising an ideal that the Bauhaus had first espoused half a century earlier. As we stand poised to break ties with EU, the exhibition provides a useful reminder of the progressive values that outsiders can bring to Britain, however little we welcome them at the time. • Beyond Bauhaus: Modernism in Britain 1933–66 is at RIBA Architecture gallery, London, until 1 February.
142	Switzerland’s second-biggest bank has sacked its chief operating officer over an “extraordinary” James Bond-style corporate espionage scandal in which private detectives were hired to follow a senior executive through the streets of Zurich after a row with the organisation’s boss at a cocktail party. Credit Suisse said on Tuesday that Pierre-Olivier Bouée had left with immediate effect after the board of directors ruled that a two-week spying operation was “wrong and disproportionate and has resulted in severe reputational damage to the bank”. Bouée will collect no payoff. The bank also announced that a private security consultant who had helped Bouée organise the spying had apparently killed himself. The Swiss financial blog Inside Paradeplatz first reported the man’s death, identifying him only as T. The man killed himself last Tuesday, according to a lawyer for the private investigative firm Investigo. At a hastily organised press conference in Zurich, the Credit Suisse chairman, Urs Rohner, said he was “greatly saddened” by Bouée’s “extraordinary” decision to hire detectives to track the movements of Iqbal Khan, whose job was to attract super-rich new clients to the bank. “This behaviour we do not tolerate it,” Rohner said. “It was wrong to order surveillance … It’s not, obviously, the standard way as to how we conduct business.” He also expressed his deepest condolences to the family of the dead security consultant. It was outside the upmarket Metropol restaurant near the Swiss National Bank in the centre of Zurich on 17 September that Khan decided to find out why he kept seeing the same car following him around town. The banker had noticed the car earlier as he and his wife dropped off their six-year-old child at football training. Credit Suisse’s official report into the spying scandal said: “Khan spotted and confronted one of his tails at the corner at the junction of Fraumünsterstrasse and Börsenstrasse.” Khan had attempted to lose the surveillance team by driving fast and erratically through the streets of Zurich, Switzerland’s financial capital. As he turned into Börsenstrasse, he leaped out of the car shouting “police, police” and whipped out his phone to take photos of the car number plate and three occupants, who were later revealed to be detectives from Investigo. Swiss police confirmed they had opened “a criminal investigation into coercion/threat”. The private detectives had also followed Khan on foot, and used the encrypted messenger service Threema, which made it impossible for Homburger, the law firm that investigated the spying scandal on behalf of Credit Suisse, to discover the full extent of the covert surveillance. The bank admitted Khan had been “observed on seven business days” since 4 September. It also said the spying had been conducted “mostly during daytime”. Khan, 43, was born in Pakistan and moved to Switzerland aged 12. He was reportedly ambitious to rise further up the ranks at Credit Suisse but had been frustrated by Credit Suisse’s chief executive, Tidjane Thiam 57. Personal relations between Khan and Thiam – the former head of the British insurance company Prudential – soured further when Khan bought a house next door to his boss in the village of Herrliberg on the so-called “gold coast” of Lake Zurich. Khan had the house levelled to the ground, and rebuilt over two years with contractors often working early mornings and at weekends, prompting Thiam to complain to Rohner. In an attempt at a rapprochement, in January Thiam invited Khan and his wife to a cocktail party for senior colleagues and friends in the ultra-wealthy neighbourhood on the north-east coast of Lake Zurich. But they reportedly had a heated argument about a row of trees Thiam had planted on his property that partially blocked Khan’s view of the lake. Khan’s wife had to stand between the two men to stop the dispute escalating further, according to a report by the Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger. Khan then also made a complaint to Rohner. The bank conceded Khan and Thiam had “a dispute, a heated discussion”, but Rohner said the official inquiry had not investigated the executives “personal differences” or the “alleged planting of trees”. But Rohner said there was “zero evidence” that Thiam knew about the spying, despite the long history of personal animosity between the two multimillionaire executives. “We strongly reject any assertions that call into question the integrity of our CEO,” said Rohner. Credit Suisse’s board found that Bouée had ordered the detectives to follow Khan under the misguided notion that the executive might be trying to persuade clients to move to the bank’s arch-rival UBS, which Khan was joining. The bank said there was no evidence to suggest Khan was seeking to poach clients. Khan’s first day at UBS following garden leaving is Tuesday. “The chief operating officer assumed responsibility for this matter and submitted his resignation to the board of directors, which has been accepted with immediate effect,” the bank said. “The Homburger investigation did not identify any indication that the chief executive had approved the observation of Iqbal Khan nor that he was aware of it prior to 18 September 2019, after the observation had been aborted.” In advance of the investigation’s publication, Credit Suisse’s largest shareholder, Harris Associates, had publicly called on the bank’s board not to sack Thiam or any other executives over the incident. “These are humans; people aren’t flawless,” Harris’s deputy chairman, David Herro, told the Financial Times. “They don’t make perfect decisions every time. And this is why, unless laws have been broken, this doesn’t seem like a case for anyone losing their job.”
143	EU’s European way of life policy is a mistake In my understanding, the expression of the “European way of life” (Daniel Trilling, 20 September) is as diverse as its geography, regions, landscapes and cities and as dynamic as its long history of migrations. From the Sahara to the Arctic circle, from the Tundra to the Atlantic Ocean, Europe exists as regions. Nation states are – in contrast – territorial. They tend to impose a “national” way of life on their citizens, centralising power. Since the 16th century they have fenced off their territories and fought wars to expand or defend them. It was after the last of those wars that the European Union was created, to transcend the nationalisms that kept generating new wars. The regions within the nation states could breathe more freely, their ways of life, their cultures and their languages were more readily recognised and appreciated. Excessive waste like “milk lakes” and “butter mountains” might have been teething problems, but the policy was part of an ideological imposition that made Brussels look like the capital of a new, super nation state. I tend to agree with Trilling: imposing a “European way of life” does not protect Europe from nationalism; rather, it fuels it. Henk Bak Trentham, Victoria, Australia Architectural planners need to chill out With reference to Stephen Buranyi’s article on air conditioning, The Big Con, (6 September), I agree that our architects and urban planners have badly let us down. I’ve lived in the tropics for most of my adult life and I’ve never had an AC unit. In the desert we lived in adobe buildings that had a natural cooling property, in the Australian Outback we had large screened verandahs that naturally circulated air, and in Puerto Rico we either had a central open patio that sucked hot air up and out, keeping the corridors windy and cool, or, as in the present arrangement, we have lots of patios and terraces that face the prevailing trade winds or away from the sun. Not only does “post planning” show a lack of responsibility for the disaster of global warming, passing the consequences of bad design to future generations, but it suggests all sorts of complacency in our attitudes to so many things we take for granted. Perhaps society has lapsed into some form of cold addiction. Like any addiction, it is killing us in stages. Before it is too late, social planners should take matters in hand and bring us back to our senses. Richard Druitt Rio Grande, Puerto Rico Criticism of Cameron overstates the case John Harris rightly lambasts the performance of the Tories in recent times, in particular David Cameron. (20 September). But like many well-meaning polemicists of the progressive left, he goes too far. He criticises Cameron for his promises to limit immigration, shut bogus colleges, require foreign visitors to pay for NHS treatment, and to end free legal aid for immigrants accused of illegal entry to the country. None of these define a political doctrine of the Tories. They are practical measures to address the real problems of overpopulation in Britain and exploitation of government services. Overstating Harris’s case doesn’t make it stronger. It gives his opponents the excuse to portray the left as unreal and impractical. Robert Horn Victoria, British Columbia, Canada Tracing the damage of Windrush deportations The hostile environments article (20 September) on the Windrush generation, besides highlighting the almost vicious manner in which deportations were handled – viz an attempted deportation on Christmas Day, when the deportee had specifically asked to spend a last time with family – raises questions on how deportees are viewed in recipient countries. From their point of view, anyone deported must be a criminal. This is one of the unintended, badly thought-out consequences of deporting people without due process and justification. It does not show the UK government in a good light. Stephen Banks Birmingham, UK Poetry can bring distant events closer to home Re: “The global heating crisis you haven’t heard of” (27 September). Gaia Vince writes, “Our lives affect, and are affected by, these tropical glaciers”. But those living thousands of kilometres away may disagree; Himalayan ice-loss can feel remote. For the truth let’s turn to our poets. WH Auden said, “The glacier knocks in the cupboard.” He knew that seemingly distant calamities are not so distant after all. Gideon Forman Toronto, Canada
150	Canada do not expect to end up goggle-eyed here on Wednesday evening despite being the lowest-ranked-but-one team in the tournament up against the side at the top and winners of the last two World Cups, New Zealand. The holders have fielded a strong side despite the outcome being as close to a foregone conclusion as is possible in a two-horse race, led by Kieran Read and boasting Richie Mo’unga and Beauden Barrett behind as the All Blacks look to build on their opening-round victory over South Africa, which all but guaranteed they would top the pool. “They are clearly skilled, but I have seen some of these guys run fitness tests so I know their fitness isn’t necessarily going to be much better than ours,” said the Canada second row Evan Olmstead. “I’ve seen them make mistakes and I have seen them do great things so it will be a special occasion for us. “Japan’s victory over Ireland gives a lot of guys confidence. We were on the bus back from training when the game was being played and we were streaming it on our phones. I never doubt myself. I always go on the field wanting to win and do not accept anything less. Seeing teams that are not rated as highly beat the big guys gives me belief.” Canada will need belief and more. They have played New Zealand five times in full internationals and the average score is 61-11 against them. “We understand what we are facing,” said the Canada head coach, Kingsley Jones, “but we look forward to it with excitement. We want to come out of the match with respect, which means sticking to the task and putting in a performance for 80 minutes.” The New Zealand flanker Ardie Savea will be making World Cup history by playing in World Rugby-approved goggles – as previously worn elsewhere by the likes of Ian McKinley – after having problems with the sight in one eye. “It is purely for protection,” said the New Zealand attack coach, Ian Foster. “When a player says that the problem in his eye is getting worse, you have to do something. He has been dealing with it for a few years and our medical team came up with this idea.” Canada are 22nd in the rankings, a fraction above Namibia, New Zealand’s opponents on Sunday. The All Blacks final group match is against Italy, a side they have scored 176 points against in their last three trips to Rome. The concern is that they go into the quarter-finals underexposed, which is why there will be no respite for Canada here. We are expanding our coverage of New Zealand.

151	The government’s pledge to invest £13bn in hospital projects across England, at the start of the Conservative party conference, won’t help the increasing number of patients I see who are being denied routine surgery on the NHS as more and more treatment is rationed. Did you know that hernia repair; hip or knee replacements; removal of cataracts, tonsils, haemorrhoids or a gallbladder; injections for back pain; and referral to specialised pain clinics are among the growing list of treatments that are no longer routinely funded by the NHS? As a GP in a large urban practice, over the last year I have seen unprecedented restrictions on primary care’s ability to access many of these treatments, and more, for patients. There used to be a shortlist, including IVF and removal of benign skin lumps, that GPs could request special funding for if their patient was deemed to be an exceptional case. Meeting the criteria was difficult, and, according to Bristol clinical commissioning group (CCG), funding applications are almost never exceptional. But as the list continues to grow, treatments that would routinely have been funded now require lengthy and convoluted applications that are hardly ever successful. Jenny (not her real name) is 52 and until six months ago was working as a full-time teacher. She has significant back pain that might benefit from spinal injections but cannot have them on the NHS. She is on strong neuropathic medication that only just takes the edge off the pain. Opioids have not helped and she no longer takes them. She is desperate. But we are running out of options. The government and CCG highlight savings through restrictions and rationing, but this fails to measure other costs to patients, healthcare and society when an experienced teacher is unable to work. Many patients such as Jenny enter a cycle of chronic pain and loss of function. They take multiple medications. Doctors can feel powerless to access effective treatments, and this puts a strain on the doctor-patient relationship. Public health cuts have also taken a big chunk out of our local provision of services. Bristol, like other councils, has been making cuts following a 2.7% reduction in its funding for public health services. In the year to April 2018, 21% of children aged four to five, and 34% aged 10 to 11, were classified as either overweight or obese in Bristol. Nationally, it is estimated that 28% of children aged two to 15 were overweight or obese in 2016. This rises to nearly two-thirds of the population of adults who are overweight or obese. We know that obesity is linked to type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and cholesterol, heart disease and some cancers. Until recently, we had access to a children’s weight management service. Alive ‘N’ Kicking offered group or one-to-one support for children with obesity and their parents. It ran sessions across several sites with referrals from nurses and GPs, and signposting from the national child measurement programme. But funding ended last week and has been replaced by online support. For adults, we had access to exercises on prescription (for part-funded activity sessions). We could also provide Slimming World and Weight Watchers vouchers. These have always been popular with patients, but these schemes locally have also been decommissioned by the council, as well as Stop Smoking and alcohol intervention services. There is a big push from the government to squeeze council and CCG budgets for short-term gains. This gives carte blanche to cut services regardless of their clinical or ethical merit. Although it is likely to feature heavily in any forthcoming election, as a GP I know there is already a huge void for patients where the NHS once was. • Zara Aziz is a GP partner in Bristol
152	Blowing on horns, waving black flags and playing blaring sirens and loud music through a speaker system, protesters outside a WeWork branch in Shoreditch, London, demanded the attention of those going in and out last week. The deafening demonstration – which called for four cleaners who have lost their jobs at WeWork to be reinstated – made for a stark contrast with the cool, modern environment inside, with its standup-friendly furniture, “writable” walls and endless stream of freshly roasted coffee. The protest highlighted a problem that has become widespread: many modern multinationals in cities across the globe are now staffed by what amounts to a two-tier workforce. Employees enjoy protected employment advantages, while the outsourced people who keep the workspaces running – who clean them and keep them safe – often have more precarious roles with inferior terms and conditions. The office rental company WeWork has grown into an empire, developing a reputation for trendy workspaces where entrepreneurs and firms can collaborate over craft beers or coffee in light airy lounges. It operates offices in around 100 cities and has around 527,000 members and 528 locations. (Guardian US leases space from WeWork.) In recent weeks, however, its parent company has been beset with problems, scrapping plans for a $20bn IPO, and WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann announced he was stepping down as chief executive. The brand sets great store by the concept of community, but that doesn’t necessarily include the cleaners, who, at least in the UK, are all outsourced workers. The dispute in London centres on four cleaners who were employed by CCM Facilities, which provides cleaning services at WeWork’s London offices. (There was a fifth dismissed cleaner involved, but he appears to have been rehired by CCM.) The protest – as with one a week earlier at No 1 Poultry near Bank – was organised by the Cleaners and Allied Independent Workers Union (CAIWU), which represents more than 1,000 workers, mainly in London’s cleaning industry. The union claims the cleaners were unfairly dismissed by CCM shortly after WeWork said it no longer wanted them on its premises. It claims there was insufficient evidence to prove allegations of misconduct made against the cleaners. Alberto Durango, CAIWU general secretary, said: “Each of the [four] cases was so-called third-party pressure, which is the client – in this case WeWork – saying we don’t want these people here. They’re the clients and they requested the removal of these guys. They have the power to say to CCM to reinstate these workers. For a cleaner, they really need their job.” While the client has the right to say they no longer want a person on its premises, “they shouldn’t be as arrogant [as] to say ‘I don’t want this person here’”, said Durango. Three of the dismissed workers were originally from Colombia and one from Ecuador. The details of their cases vary. One, Julian Ortiz, says he asked a member of security at the Paddington branch of WeWork where he worked if he could borrow a projector, and that they agreed. When the company told him the staff member didn’t have the authority to agree to that, he brought the projector back promptly, he says. He was suspended by CCM a few days later, he says. He’s now found part-time work, but misses his old job: “I felt so happy when I was working with WeWork.” Another, Jorge Montoya, says his daughter was working at the same WeWork branch that he was, so WeWork requested he be moved to another one. He claims CCM offered him work at another site but later dismissed him. A third worker, who doesn’t speak fluent English, was cleaning a staircase when someone approached the wet floor, said Durango. “In broken English he says ‘don’t pass’” and the person took offence, the CAIWU general secretary said. A fourth cleaner was accused of making a racist remark to a member of staff, a claim he denies. While outsourcing isn’t a new phenomenon, the scale of it is – it’s one of the biggest growth industries in the past decade. Cleaners, security guards and catering staff at multinational companies, universities, hospitals and other big organisations (including the Guardian) are often employed by other companies. The two-tier system means the balance of power at outsourcing firms is firmly in favour of the client: they won’t want to lose a valuable customer. Client companies using outsourced workers often insist in contracts that they retain the right to request a worker be removed, said Molly De Dios of the United Voices of the World union, a large proportion of whose members work in the cleaning sector. And the clients use that right. “Unfortunately, client requests for removal are very common,” said De Dios. While there will be instances when a company has genuine concerns about someone’s professional performance or conduct, sometimes the reasons for the removal appear more suspect, she said. The union has heard allegations about cleaning companies colluding with clients when they want to get rid of an outsourced worker for a spurious reason without repercussions. In some cases there are claims of false accusations, or workers being dismissed simply because someone took a dislike to them. “The cleaning sector, and the service sector more generally, is a massive migrant labour workforce, and language can be used to manipulate,” said De Dios. She added: “The big issue of outsourcing is workers are completely unprotected against it. Clients often have written into a contract that they have the right to request the removal from site of any worker without having to provide explanations, so the only case that an employer would be liable in that event would be if you could prove that they requested their removal on grounds of discrimination.” United Voices of the World, which is currently involved in seven live disputes in the UK, fights to bring cleaners in-house. “Outsourcing is a complete farce, it shouldn’t exist at all – it’s terrible,” De Dios said. ‘“It leaves workers with fewer rights and it means the clients who are essentially the employer (because the cleaners are cleaning their site) aren’t legally responsible or liable for anything.” Outsourced workers are treated as a disposable and inferior workforce, said De Dios; she gave the example of a cleaner at a London hospital who was told she couldn’t use the staff room and to eat her lunch on the stairs. When a client asks for the removal of a worker, the employer should investigate the basis of the objection and offer alternative jobs, said De Dios. She said that in some instances they are not properly investigated and the alternative jobs offered involve a long commute, or fewer hours, or the employee isn’t given long enough to make a decision. In the case of the four WeWork cleaners, CCM says two were offered alternative employment that they turned down. However, the CAIWU union claims the workers asked for the details to be sent in writing so they could consider them properly, but were instead told they had declined them. A CCM Facilities spokesperson said in a statement: “CCM Facilities Limited take matters of this nature very seriously and we have fully investigated these concerns about work place performance and misconduct. “Of the four individuals, two were offered alternative employment, which was declined in both cases. The two other cases resulted in dismissals, which were both upheld at appeal. To CCM Facilities Ltd[’s] knowledge, none of these individuals have filed employment tribunal cases for unfair dismissal or any other reasons.” WeWork declined to comment.

153	Mao Tse-tung lays down conditions Hong Kong, October 2 Yesterday was an epoch-making occasion in the history of Asia, with Mao Tse-tung, chairman of the Central People’s Government Council of the People’s Republic of China, formally proclaiming the inauguration of the new regime. He claimed that the “war of the people’s liberation” had now been “fundamentally won” and announced that the Central Government Council had appointed Chou En-lai as Premier and Foreign Minister, and Chu Teh as commander-in-chief, with Mao himself as chairman of the People’s Revolutionary Military Council. “At the same time the Central People’s Government Council decided to declare to the Governments of all countries,” Mao Tse-tung added, that this Government is the sole legal Government, representing all the people of the People’s Republic of China. This Government is willing to observe the principles of equality, mutual respect of territorial integrity and sovereignty.” The Communist New China news agency reports that an estimated 200,000 people gathered to hear this historic pronouncement. All stood to attention when Mao Tse-Tung hoisted the new flag of Communist China (five yellow stars on a red background) and the band played the new national anthem, The March of the Volunteers. Air Force on show After the pronouncement there was a ceremonial parade at which Chu Teh took the salute. Units of various branches of the armed forces, some equipped with up-to-date American artillery, tanks, and armoured cars captured from the Nationalists, took part in the march-past, while fighters and bombers of the Communist Air Force flew in formation overhead. Taking part in the celebrations were the 43 members of the Soviet cultural and educational mission headed by Mr Alexander Fadeyev, who (according to some Communist dispatches) had been accorded special ambassadorial rank by his Government for this occasion. As far as is known here no other foreign representatives attended the Peking ceremonies. Soviet breaks with Canton: Peking recognised Moscow, October 2 The Soviet Government to-night recognised the new People’s Republic of China and broke off relations with the Chinese Nationalist Government at Canton. Mr. Gromyko, the Deputy Foreign Minister, announced his Government’s decision in a telegram to Chou En-lai, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the People’s Republic. Russia is withdrawing her envoy from the present Nationalist headquarters at Canton. In a statement to the Charge d’Affaires of the Canton Government in Moscow to-day Mr. Gromyko declared the Nationalist Government had ceased to exercise power and had become merely a “provincial Government of Canton.” Editorial: the party line in China 23 September 1949 The American White Paper on China contains the text of an article by Mao Tse-tung, who has just proclaimed formally the People’s Republic of China. This was written last July to commemorate the twenty-eighth anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist party. It is the most up-to-date statement of Mao’s political ideas, and is a strange mixture of the ingenuous and the practical. Mao begins by accepting the old-fashioned Marxist dogma in its most doctrinaire form. Mao does not offer much hope of any accommodation between the Chinese Communist State and the West. Mao expects help only from Russia. He admits that Communist government in China will be dictatorial. The right of reactionaries to voice their opinions must be deprived and only the people are allowed to have the right of voicing their opinions…To the hostile classes, the State apparatus is the instrument of oppression. It is violent, not benevolent. So far, Mao is perfectly orthodox. But at this stage he begins to temporise. This is an edited extract. Read the article in full.
154	Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary has criticised Britain’s Civil Aviation Authority for awarding Thomas Cook a licence just months before its collapse and said the package holiday market was finished. Thomas Cook, the world’s oldest travel firm, collapsed last week, leaving more than 150,000 UK holidaymakers stranded abroad. O’Leary praised the CAA for its Operation Matterhorn rescue airline set up to bring back stranded passengers, but said it needed to do more to prevent airline failures in the first place. “How you can license Thomas Cook in April as fit to fly for another 12 months and then it goes bust in September. [It] is something the CAA needs to address,” he said. Speaking at a Reuters Newsmakers event, O’Leary added: “The CAA should be much more aggressive in requiring the shareholders of those companies to put up much more cash to get through the year, rather than allowing them to continually fail.” The CAA granted Thomas Cook its airline operating certificate in April while its Atol licence, which guarantees repatriation and refunds for holidaymakers if their tour operator goes bust, was due for renewal this month. Thomas Cook’s airline was profitable and had been put up for sale in February. However, a buyer could not be found. Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair’s chief marketing officer, said at a separate press briefing that Ryanair was lobbying the CAA to introduce more robust, quarterly stress tests for airlines and tour operators, and to force “financially weak” firms to set aside money to cover the repatriation of passengers should the companies go bust. The CAA said: “We thank Ryanair and the rest of the aviation industry for their support as we focus our efforts on repatriating 150,000 Thomas Cook passengers. The CAA is responsible for licensing travel businesses, including considering their financial fitness, and we take these responsibilities very seriously. “We also take part actively in discussions about reforming the regulatory framework. We participated fully in the independent insolvency review which investigated what more could be done to protect consumers in the event of a future insolvency. We stand ready to work with the government and industry to implement recommendations from the review.” O’Leary was blunt about the the package holiday market, saying it was “screwed, it’s over”. According to the travel industry group Abta , half of UK holidaymakers took a package holiday last year, a figure that has held steady since 2014. Thomas Cook’s rival Tui has fared better, with strong demand for for holiday experiences. It also owns many of its hotels. Ryanair, Europe’s biggest carrier expects passenger numbers to stay flat at 46.3m in the UK next year, despite a likely boost from former Thomas Cook customers. It launched 14 new routes including flights from London Stansted to Terceira in the Azores and Manchester to Pisa. Ryanair still plans to shut some lossmaking bases, and warned some pilots would lose their jobs, as it has 500 more than it needs. Jacobs said the number of redundancies would be lower than that as pilots who quit will not be replaced and others are being offered unpaid leave. O’Leary dismissed criticism of the €100m (£89m) bonus the airline could hand him over five years, saying it was an “easy target” for the mediaand they should focus on Premier League footballers’ pay instead. O’Leary’s new pay package was passed by a wafer-thin majority of 50.5% of shareholders at the last annual meeting. He said Ryanair would wait for “the next turn in the cycle” before ordering more Boeing or Airbus jets at cheaper prices. The Irish carrier is one of the biggest customers of Boeing’s grounded 737 Max aircraft, with 135 firm aircraft orders and 75 options, and O’Leary said the company could add Airbus jets to its fleet in the medium term.
155	Iranian courts have sentenced one man to death for spying for the US and jailed two others for 10 years for the same crime, as well as imprisoning a fourth person for six years for spying for Britain, an Iranian judiciary spokesman has said. “One person has been sentenced to death for spying for America … but the ruling has been appealed,” Gholamhossein Esmaili told the judiciary’s news website, Mizan, on Tuesday. He also told the official Iranian TV channel: “A spy working for the Iranian defence ministry was sentenced to death on a charge of spying for the United States.” The man sentenced to death was not identified. Iranian agencies said Ali Nafriyeh and Mohammad Ali Babapour had been sentenced for spying on behalf of the US, while Mohammad Ali Nasab was sentenced for spying for Britain. The development marks another blow to European efforts to calm tensions between Iran and the US, which is pursuing a policy of maximum economic pressure against Tehran. The UK claims that sentences handed down to numerous British Iranian dual nationals, including Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, amount to a form of state hostage-taking. She has been held on spying charges since 2016. The UK held a behind-closed-doors session on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York last week to highlight the state of human rights in Iran. Discussions have been under way in private between the US and Iran about a prisoner swap, including at the UN last week. In New York, the US offered to allow the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, access to the ailing Iranian ambassador to the UN, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, but only if an American in an Iranian jail was released. Zarif’s movements at the UN had been restricted by the US as a condition for granting him a visa to attend the general assembly. Brian Hook, the state department’s special representative for Iran, said that if Iran wanted to show good faith, it should release the US citizens it has detained, including Xiyue Wang, a Princeton University graduate student who was arrested in Iran in 2016. At a news conference in New York last Thursday, the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, said Tehran was open to talking about prisoner swaps but that the ball was in Washington’s court after Iran’s release of a Lebanese man with US permanent residency in June. A British-Iranian anthropologist, Kameel Ahmady, was arrested in August and also taken to Evin prison, where Zaghari-Ratcliffe is being held. Charges against him have not yet been made public. There has been British concern about Ahmady. The academic is an Iranian Kurd who was born in the western city of Mahabad and granted British citizenship in 1994 but has been living in Iran for the last 14 years. A court has separately sentenced Rouhani’s brother to five years in prison, Esmaili told the semi-official Fars news agency. In May, Hossein Fereydoun was sentenced to an unspecified jail term in a corruption case that the president’s supporters allege was politically motivated. Esmaili said on Tuesday that Fereydoun was jailed for five years but may face further charges in another case, but did not give further details, Fars reported.
156	Australia’s mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass meadows are absorbing about 20m tonnes of carbon dioxide every year, according to a major new study that is the first to measure in detail the climate benefits of the coastal ecosystems. But the study, published in the journal Nature Communications, warns that degradation of these “vegetated coastal ecosystems” was already seeing 3 million tonnes of CO2 per year being released back into the atmosphere. The study reveals Australia’s vast coastlines represent between 5% and 11% of all the so called “blue carbon” locked up in mangroves, seagrasses and tidal marshes globally. Some 44 scientists from 33 different research institutions collaborated on the study, which began in 2014. Dr Oscar Serrano, at Edith Cowan University’s Centre for Marine Ecosystems Research, said it found the coastal ecosystems stored between 4,000m tonnes and 6,300m tonnes of CO2. Australia’s annual emissions hit a record high in 2018 of 558.4m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. Serrano said: “When these ecosystems are damaged by storms, heatwaves, dredging or other human development, the carbon dioxide stored in their biomass and soils beneath them can make its way back into the environment, contributing to climate change. “Globally, vegetated coastal ecosystems are being lost twice as fast as tropical rainforests despite covering a fraction of the area.” Coastal ecosystems store carbon in their soils as well as in the plants themselves and, once absorbed, the carbon can be locked away for thousands of years if undisturbed. They are able to absorb at up to 40 times faster than forests. “They also protect the coasts from erosion, are important nurseries for fisheries and they clear up the water so it’s very important for several reasons that we preserve these ecosystems,” Serrano said. He said the ecosystems were being impacted by coastal developments, dredging and by climate change. The annual losses of carbon from the coastal ecosystems was the equivalent of a 12% to 21% increase in Australia’s land-use emissions from activities such as land-clearing. In 2015, mangroves on the Gulf of Carpentaria suffered an unprecedented mass dieback along a 1,000-kilometre stretch of coastline that coincided with a major heatwave. Prof Norman Duke, of James Cook University, who was not part of the study, said the advantage of quantifying the carbon stored in mangroves was that it created a “marketable commodity” that could be used as part of carbon trading schemes. Duke, who is leading a project to assess the mass dieback event, said mangroves were a particularly powerful tool to cut emissions because they had about five times more capacity to store carbon than trees on the land. He said: “Because we’re trying to reduce the release of carbon into the atmosphere, this gives us a very strong incentive [to protect them]. But that’s not the only benefits that mangroves deliver – they give habitats to fisheries and protect our coastlines.” Recovery of mangroves in the gulf has been hampered by dead mangroves, broken up by subsequent storms, piling up on areas of new growth. A seperate study has found the Gulf of Carpentaria’s dead mangroves emit eight times the amount of powerful greenhouse gas methane than live mangroves. Dr Andy Steven, coasts research director at CSIRO and a co-author of the research, said: “When we started this work in 2014, we had no real numbers. We didn’t know how significant it was, or even if they were worth thinking about. But we’ve shown demonstrably that these ecosystems are very significant.” To calculate the carbon content of the ecosystems, the researchers combined satellite data on the extent of mangroves and tidal marshes with direct measurements of the carbon stored in soils and plants. Serrano and Stevens said there was hope the methodology used to calculate the climate benefits of vegetated coastal ecosystems would be used as part of Australia’s official national greenhouse accounts in the future. Serrano said the research could position Australia as a “world leader” in protecting blue carbon ecosystems, adding other countries could use their work to make their own national measurements.

159	Everywhere you turned, there were the memories. In the tunnel, there was Roy Keane telling Patrick Vieira he’d see him out there. By the touchline there was Gary Neville kicking José Antonio Reyes. Just outside the penalty area, there was Martin Keown jostling Ruud van Nistelrooy. Remember? Remember how every man knew when we reached out to claim the throne? Remember when we were kings? Those pre-Abramovich days when this was the biggest game in English football seem a long time ago now, two decades gone with atrocious haste. Manchester United and Arsenal aren’t even the best sides in their respective cities any more and on nights like Monday it was impossible not to wonder how long it will take them to get back to where they were, whether they ever will get back. There are two great lies in football. The first, the short-term one, is transition. It’s an excuse made easier by the impatience of so much of football’s culture. Any manager can brush off a defeat or a run of poor form by saying his side is in transition. When the sack comes they can claim they just needed more time. Sometimes it is true. Among the most vivid of all the memories that haunt Old Trafford is the reaction to the 2-1 defeat against Crystal Palace in December 1989. The bedsheet bemoaning “three years of excuses” may be the most famous manifestation of the discontent but the fans en masse were in uproar. Six months later, United won the FA Cup and 23 years of success under Alex Ferguson had begun. It’s easy now to wonder what might have happened had the board not held its nerve, had Mark Robins not scored that winner at Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup. If memories of that season and an instance when the transition was demonstrably in the right direction incline fans to caution now it is understandable. But often transition is just another word for stagnation. That season 30 years ago feels particularly relevant now. This is the fewest points United have had after seven games of a league season since then. Such judgments are subjective, but this feels the weakest squad United have had since then, certainly relative to the rest of the league. It’s not necessarily straightforward to tell in the moment but back then there was a clear plan as Ferguson refashioned and professionalised the squad. Can anybody, looking at this squad, at the recent transfers in and out, honestly say they can see a clear policy? Does anybody have any faith, even if fortunes are splurged, that things will be better in two transfer widows? In four? In six? Football’s other great lie is that success is cyclical, as though if you’re big enough things will come good if you wait long enough. Squads have cycles, it’s true, and whoever is in charge of long-term development, be that a manager or a sporting director, must manage the age profile of a team while fighting a constant war with entropy – but those are the details. There is also a macro picture and it’s that that must be of serious concern for United. A lack of planning, a lack of nous, are beginning to affect the financial picture. United’s latest financial results show a record wage bill of £332m, 43% up on three years ago and 22% higher than the club with the next highest wages in the Premier League, Liverpool. Commercial revenue, meanwhile, has essentially stagnated over the past four years – although it remains 18.5% higher than that of City, who are second in that particular chart. Ed Woodward may be a genius at finding sponsors and partners in every market, and there’s no reason for panic just yet, but slowly underperformance in the league is beginning to have an impact. After nine points from seven games this season, after 19 goals in their last 21 games, after an awkwardly imbalanced side lurched to another less-than-impressive result, the temptation is to start looking down rather than up. The gulf to City seems unbridgeable, at least in the short term, at least while Pep Guardiola remains in situ – and given how adroitly City’s present owners have planned everything so far, they’re as well placed to manage that transition as any side could be. The reports that Giovanni van Bronckhorst is already being groomed as his successor is indicative of a long-term perspective alien to the vast majority of clubs. The question now is rather how low United could go. The financial structure of modern football means there’s not going to be another relegation, as in 1974, and given how tightly bunched the league is, 10th isn’t necessarily as bad as it may appear. But United could easily finish behind Leicester City this season, and perhaps West Ham and Everton as well. There are no guarantees even of Europa League football. And that was what was most striking about Monday. It looked like a mid-table game and it felt like a mid-table game. Apart from everybody talking about how great it used to be, United v Arsenal felt like a nonevent.
160	Just a month to go, then, until the beginning of the end. Or the start of the beginning. Or something like that anyway. The last week in October will see English cricket’s inaugural draft, a first bolt of lightning shot through the Hundred’s shell-company teams. Unbidden, unprecedented, not to mention rootless and entirely commercial in nature; the franchises are coming. Not that this is completely new. Look hard enough and they’re already here. Rewind to early August and down a winding lane, through a patch of woodland, in the middle of a new-build timber hangar a few miles off the A3, Jaydev Unadkat is trying to teach a nervous-looking 13-year-old left-arm seamer how to stop dragging his line down outside leg stump by lifting his front arm a little higher. “The front arm is your radar,” Unadkat says, urging his charge to try it right now in front of 30 or so academy mates, plus assembled coaches, camera crew and the watching throng on the balcony. The nervous-looking seamer bites his lip, runs in, elevates his front arm and pings off stump out of its slot with a satisfying clank, just about concealing the flush of delighted relief as he strolls down to retrieve his ball. The coaches nod. Training ticks on. Unadkat, who has played Test cricket for India and was the most expensive Indian player at last year’s Indian Premier League auction, attends to some other pace bowling detail. And the only really puzzling thing about any of this is the fact everyone present is wearing the bright pink shirt of the Rajasthan Royals of Jaipur. The Royals have always positioned themselves as a hub for English IPL interests. From the start this most moneyball-ish of franchises has had a sprinkling of English players, from early Shane Warne-sourced adoptees Dimitri Mascherenas and Michael Lumb to the current A-list tier of Ben Stokes, Jofra Archer and Jos Buttler. The academy is something new. The following weekend these junior Royals will play Hampshire Under-15s at the Ageas Bowl, part of an ever-thickening round of county and touring fixtures. Even Unadkat is here on serious business, a training trip that will see him work with the bowling fitness guru and Royals consultant Steffan Jones. The part-owner Manoj Badale is agreeably open about all this. The goal of the Royals in England isn’t just to build the brand (as ever those outside English sport’s traditions speak with genuine pride about their sporting brands). It is to create a concrete cricketing presence, to foster the dream of a direct pathway from English grassroots to cricket’s most glam-laden stage. “Of course we’d love to see that happen,” Badale says. “We will also be happy if the academy continues to launch players in the county circuit, who then become England stars of the future.” Sounds fanciful? A few weeks after the Hampshire game Sid Lahiri, the mercurial head of the Royals’ UK academy, is still talking about a shot played by one hugely talented 13- year-old in Royals colours – a ramp-swept one-bounce four off an opening bowler – that seems to suggest the sky might indeed be the limit. “A hundred percent it is the ultimate dream to go and play for Rajasthan Royals,” Lahiri says. “I am sure that will happen. The talent pool is there. If you look at the English kids we are coaching I would be surprised if we don’t see at least one of them in the Rajasthan Royals colours in a few years.” Lahiri is a fascinating figure in his own right. He came to England in 2003 to take his coaching badges at the end of some slightly frustrating travels around the domestic scene in India. “I knew nobody, had no clue, nobody knew who I was. I started with one boy. I had nothing. Just us at the park.” Eventually his time playing at Stoke D’Abernon, teaching cricket at Parkside school, and a generous cash gift from one very grateful and very wealthy parent – Lahiri bought four bowling machines with the money – led to the creation of Star Cricket Academy. At which point a bloom of young Surrey talent rolled in through the door. Lahiri coached Ollie Pope from the age of seven (“even then his ability to learn was mind-blowing”) as well as Ryan Patel, Amir Virdi and others. In 2019 his setup at Reeds School was rolled up into Rajasthan Royals’ UK academy, a tie-in that has its roots in Lahiri’s long-standing relationship with Zubin Bharucha, now the Royals’ head of cricket. If there is still an air of double-take about all this, a sense of a punt, an entrepreneurial gamble, it is worth remembering the IPL is in itself a punt, albeit one that has from a standing start become the ninth most watched league in world sport. Why have the Rajasthan Royals opened an academy in England? For the same reason Barcelona, Real Madrid and Manchester United have academies in every major sporting nation in the world, outriders of football’s steamrollering cultural ascent. As Badale says: “We were attracted to the UK as a market due to our existing fanbase here, our three English stars [Ben, Jofra and Jos] and the fact we have a deep network in this country.” There will be a temptation to shrug at this, to tut at the suggestion the Royals might make a dent in English cricket culture. But then English cricket has a history of missing the top line with India, Twenty20 and shifting tectonic plates. Like it or not the IPL is an expansionist force. It has to grow, has to stretch its tentacles. The franchise system offers this. A franchise, unlike a country, can be marketed and finessed as a brand, ranked on a scale of nought to Real Madrid or the Dallas Cowboys. There has already been talk of IPL franchises expanding via merger and acquisitions into the leagues of other countries. The Rajasthan Royals enter the Hundred: it won’t happen in any version of the future that doesn’t involve the cricketing public marching on ECB HQ brandishing pitchforks and lighted torches. For now the IPL will content itself with talk of fan parks, with an expansionist broadcast strategy (up significantly in the UK in the last two years) and with its seed planted in deepest Surrey. Something will grow here. It might be a tranche of fast-tracked English-born IPL players. Or simply a sense that the wild, aggressively entrepreneurial spirit of big sport, with all its collateral damage and brutal modernity, might just be the way to grow this cobwebbed old summer game in whatever direction it can find. • This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian’s weekly cricket email.

161	“They told me I was crazy,” admitted Miquel Olmo, who played for and later managed various clubs in Spain. “I was a coach in the Spanish second division and they massacred me for it, saying I was ruining my son’s career. Leaving Barcelona was not easy, especially if you were the captain, and he was also playing for the national team. It was the most difficult decision in his life.” It is now more than five years since his son Daniel - known as Dani – left the famed La Masia to join Dinamo Zagreb. He was not lured by big money or big promises. Barely 16, a top prospect and team captain in his generation, he was closely followed by other elite European clubs – reportedly Manchester United and Manchester City were particularly interested in snatching the youngster away from the Camp Nou — but the Olmo family sought an option they thought would be best for Dani’s development. His best chance, they felt, was not at Barcelona, where he would find it difficult to break through into the first team despite his exceptional talents. But choosing Croatia, even if it was a top club there, well-known for its academy that had produced such as Luka Modric and Mateo Kovacic, came as a shock to everyone. In Zagreb, however, where developing players and selling them is the core business, he was to be made into a club ‘project’. Olmo had just signed a youth contract with Dinamo when he received a message from his Barcelona coach. “Leave out the nonsense, Dani,” he told him. “The Monday practice starts at 10.” Andy Bara is a Croatian agent who came up with the idea of bringing Olmo to Zagreb after meeting his father at one of Barcelona’s youth camps where he was coaching. He says: “Barcelona refused to accept that Dani had left them, let alone joined Dinamo. They constantly sent him messages saying ‘Where have you gone?’ and ‘What have you done?’” At first the idea must have sounded crazy indeed but in retrospect it was precisely because Olmo Senior was not a complete outsider to player development at Barcelona that his son and he could be convinced into making such a move. They had so little faith in the club that they would rather venture into the unknown, making a fresh start in a completely foreign and unglamorous football culture, than stay where Dani had already established himself as one of the leading talents. That, of course, poses some uneasy questions about the future of player development at elite European clubs – questions which the Premier League clubs are certainly familiar with, especially after Jadon Sancho’s successful move to Borussia Dortmund. Dani Olmo’s path will now serve as an example of what is possible because he has really made it big with Dinamo. Last season was definitely his breakthrough as he was voted the best player in the Prva HNL by coaches and captains, had a great season in the Europa League, where the club reached the knockout stages, and finished it with winning the Under-21 European Championship with Spain. He arrived as a substitute but ended up scoring in the final and being selected in the team of the tournament. Still 21, he has continued to lead the young La Roja in this season’s qualifiers, scoring three goals in two games. So what kind of player is Olmo? A quick dribbler with superb vision of the game and high resistance to pressing, both creative and tough in challenges. A model professional, he can play on both wings but is best fielded centrally behind the striker, where he finds rational and intelligent solutions either to set up goals for his teammates or to score himself. In Dinamo’s 4-0 Champions League win over Atalanta he did not score or assist for any goals but was still ridiculously good – according to InStat, he won 24 challenges, including 12 successful dribbles (out of 14 attempts) and was the ever-present, central figure to all of his team’s attacks. And that was his Champions League debut. He has obviously become too good for Dinamo and everyone expected him to join one of the bigger clubs but Dinamo asked for too much money – reportedly €40m, which is unheard of for a player in the Croatian League. If he continues to play like this, though, the club just might get their way. “We won’t let them beat us easily,” Olmo says about the game against Manchester City on Tuesday. “We’ll play to win.” They might not win, although Dinamo should by no means be underestimated this season and the Atalanta match proved that. But Olmo will still use the opportunity to show himself on the big stage, at the home of a club where he could have ended up five years ago if the family had gone for money rather than his best chance of development. Now he is pretty much set to make the leap back to the elite anyway. “Everything changed,” says Miquel Olmo. “Today they say we were courageous and made the best decision.”
162	If you want to understand the perilous state of federal scientific research, ask Linda Birnbaum. For 40 years, Birnbaum has worked as a toxicologist for the US government, rising through the ranks to direct both the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the National Toxicology Program. She has authored more than 700 peer-reviewed publications and collected numerous awards and international accolades for her research on public health. Now, as she prepares for an October retirement from the institute she says she has tried to “protect” from the ramifications of Donald Trump’s election, Birnbaum has words of warning about the dire path ahead she sees for public health. We ought to listen to what she has to say. Birnbaum fears that the US regulatory system has become too politicized, too beholden to corporate money and power, and lacks the urgency and political will needed to address dire health crises around the globe. Many of those crises are tied to the climate emergency, which she considers the “biggest threat to humanity.” “Everyone should be worried about that,” she told me. “The impacts on health are myriad and we’re seeing them now. It is not just about remote places like the Arctic, but about the health of people everywhere.” Along with the obvious environmental damage, increasing flooding, fires, extreme heat and drought, combined with rising CO2 levels, also contribute to sicknesses and disease. The extreme weather also leads to a loss of micronutrients and protein in many food crops important for health, she says. Those most at risk from complacency are children, who are particularly vulnerable to the air and water pollution associated with climate change. Also troubling Birnbaum are the impacts of exposures to pesticides and other chemicals on children and other vulnerable populations. From neurotoxic insecticides to a class of industrial chemicals known as PFAS, increasingly research shows that low level chronic exposures to a toxic soup of multiple pervasive pollutants jeopardizes the health of current and future generations, she said. “We have a very small world,” Birnbaum said. “People need to understand that pollution is global, not local,” and “it’s not just high-level acute exposures that are doing damage”. Low-level exposure is also dangerous, and people have different susceptibility. “An old person and a healthy adult and a little child are impacted differently.” Part of the problem is the way that resources are allocated. “Infectious diseases are where so much of the money goes but that is not the biggest killer anymore,” she said. “It’s these chronic low levels of exposure, and long-term effects of early life exposure, which are hard to identify and are causing so much damage.” The Trump administration’s recent decision to continue to allow farmers to treat food crops with the insecticide chlorpyrifos, done at the bidding of Dow Chemical, is a prime example of how children’s health is taking a back seat to corporate interests, according to Birnbaum. The science showing that chlorpyrifos harms brain development in children is “open and shut”, Birnbaum said, with concrete evidence that “exposure to chlorpyrifos impacts learning and memory and behavior in children”. Similar comments got Birnbaum in trouble with lawmakers a year and a half ago, when she was accused by Republicans of violating anti-lobbying laws for calling for more protective public health policies. The ensuing pressure, including an investigatory demand for her emails and other records, cost her an annual raise and curtailed her ability to speak freely. Birnbaum said the pressure was not a factor in her decision to retire. She has a hand-picked leadership team in place, increased funding for the institute, and a strategic plan that she feels leaves the institute “in a good place”. She had planned to retire two years ago but the election of Trump made her decide to stay to ensure the institute stayed on course. And after her retirement becomes official on 3 October, the 72-year-old Birnbaum says she will continue sharing her scientific knowledge, and is particularly interested in working with people running for office. “I am not walking away from science,” she said. Let’s hope America doesn’t walk away from science, either.

163	For years, when the climate movement called for “connecting the dots,” they meant linking extreme weather to the broader story of human-caused climate breakdown. In the age of the Green New Deal, our job is to connect the dots in a different way: between the climate crisis and the crises of economic and racial inequality that afflict us every day. And we have an opportunity to get concrete – literally – by showing precisely how targeted green investment in racialized and working-class communities can slash carbon emissions. One truly radical and intersectional approach? Tackle the United States’ housing and climate crises at the same time – with a Green New Deal for housing. Of course, the centrist climate wonks hate how expansive the Green New Deal idea is. They think every piece of its social policy is an expensive distraction. But they forgot to follow the carbon beyond their tidy little graphs. In the real world, you can’t separate the carbon causing the climate emergency from our physical and economic systems, any more than you can separate windows, furnaces, and air conditioners from your monthly rent bill. And you can’t separate voters’ – and political organizers’ – desires for a safe and affordable home from their commitment to a stable climate. In aggregate, the United States’ 138m housing units cause over 15% of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions, more than all commercial buildings combined. Housing inequality is also the biggest driver of the country’s horrifying wealth gap, with the median black family owning just $11,000, compared to the median white family owning over $135,000. And housing costs are destroying Americans’ budgets. Nearly 20m households spend over half their income on rent or mortgage payments. Another 20m pay over a third. While the climate movement flexes its muscles by holding climate strikes and blocking pipelines, housing movements all around the country are racking up wins, with campaigns like the Homes Guarantee putting national rent control on the mainstream political agenda. Anyone hoping to become the Democratic nominee should be able to answer the question: what will your climate plan do for the housing crisis? Or, to flip it around: What can your housing policies do for the climate emergency? Either way, a good answer should be the same: a lot. After all, the stories of inequality and energy converge. Homes’ carbon emissions are a reflection of something more visceral: brutal energy costs. Over a third of US households can’t readily afford their monthly utility bill, with people of color disproportionately burdened. One study found that the single main reason that people take out payday loans is to cover utility bills. The third most common reason? To make rent. So far, Bernie Sanders’ mammoth Green New Deal and Housing for All platforms go furthest in tackling these two crises together. Sanders’ plans call for building nearly 10m units of no-carbon, publicly funded housing. And his plans call for massive investments in green upgrades for existing public housing, and doing a massive energy efficiency retrofit program for other homes and buildings, with a focus on low-income residents who cannot afford their own upgrades. And Sanders’ plan calls for universal rent control and zoning changes to facilitate apartment building in affluent neighborhoods; together, these measures would greatly increase affordable density, the cornerstone of no-carbon urbanism. If you were wondering how a jobs guarantee would find work for everyone, now you know: making every home in the country safer, more comfortable, more affordable, and more climate-friendly. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has also spoken about how beautiful, sustainable, and resident-friendly affordable housing complexes, with social services like childcare facilities on the ground floor, exemplify the conjoined social and ecological promise of a Green New Deal. We can push all this ambition forward, and make it even more specific. Here’s where the progressive group People’s Action’s Homes Guarantee campaign comes in. (Full disclosure: I was on the campaign’s policy team.) The Homes Guarantee plan’s headline demand is, to echo Bernie, yuge: 12m new units of social housing, built to emit net zero carbon emissions, include a mix of incomes (with the priority going to very low-income households), and built in a way that pioneers low-carbon and sustainable construction methods. Indeed, Sanders’ more recent housing plan explicitly echoes People’s Action’s proposal, from specifics like its Green New Deal tie-ins to its all-encompassing ambition. Sanders’ plan states outright that “we need a homes guarantee”. Yes, it’s counterintuitive to call for a big homebuilding program when we need to emit less. But here’s the thing. In the decades ahead, upwards of 13 million people living in the US could be displaced by sea level rise. Tens of millions of immigrants could – and should – come live in the US. Tens of millions of people will need new homes in the years ahead. It’s precisely through public regulation and public building that we ensure that new homes are net zero carbon. This will vastly reduce overall energy demand, making it much easier to reach zero carbon in our energy system fast. Projects of new and retrofitted affordable housing in the US and around the world are already pioneering green housing techniques. And it’s through those policies that we will develop the skills to slash the ecological footprint of new construction, through more efficient techniques of homebuilding, and by driving sustainable innovations in building materials, like no-carbon concrete. In this way, a Green New Deal for housing would have benefits that go beyond directly affected residents, by driving down the costs of going green for everyone. At the neighborhood level, Sanders and the Homes Guarantee call for making every social housing complex a resiliency center to keep people safe during disasters and heat waves. Our choice is private inefficiency, waste, and injustice, or equality and sustainability through public action, finally providing everyone with a decent home. The Homes Guarantee platform also calls for national rent control and pro-apartment zoning changes. And it calls for green upgrades to existing public housing, getting rid of natural gas and toxic mold. And the platform calls for massive investment into racialized communities to lift up households of color and tackle environmental injustice, through a vast array of careful policies, from energy retrofits to facilitating community land trusts to increasing access to clean transit to universal rent control to protecting families from displacement. A Green New Deal for Housing would be an effective and efficient lever for decarbonizing the economy, creating good jobs, and increasing social, economic, and racial justice. And its core components are already popular. Over the last year, polling by the think tank Data for Progress, where I’m a senior fellow, found majority support for many of this plan’s most crucial elements long before it was put together. In one poll, majorities of both Democrats and Independents – and an overall majority of 57% of total respondents – said that green investments should be prioritized in frontline communities, namely the working class and racialized neighborhoods that have suffered most from pollution and disinvestment. Majority support holds up even when respondents are told this green investment would require tax raises. This past April, Data for Progress also found majority support for the idea that the government should fund enough non-profit and public housing units to ensure that every American without a home should get one (60% support, 23% opposition, 17% no opinion). They found majority support for a policy creating a $50bn fund to weatherize all low-income homes (58% support, 23% opposition, 19% no opinion). And they found strong support for the idea that there that smaller, low-cost housing should be built in middle- and upper-middle-class neighborhoods (49% support, 25% opposed, 26% no opinion). Is it really so impractical to link climate policy and housing policy – the climate movement and the housing movement – around solutions that would tackle both crises at once? With the climate emergency, everything is connected. We know why that’s dangerous. It’s time to talk about the benefits of all that intersectionality: we can – indeed must – solve our most pressing crises at the same time. Daniel Aldana Cohen is assistant professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, where he directs the Socio-Spatial Climate Collaborative, or (SC)2. He’s also a senior fellow at Data for Progress, and a member of the Homes Guarantee policy team
164	The British government is reported to have proposed setting up customs sites near the border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland as a means to overcome the impasse over the so-called backstop in the EU withdrawal agreement. What are the proposals and will they work? What is the government’s plan? According to the plan leaked to the Irish broadcaster RTE, the solution for trade on the Irish border involves customs clearance sites not at the border, but between five and 10 miles from either side of it. Alternatively HGV drivers and cargo owners could elect to have a tracking device on their vehicle which would be monitored in real time with customs declarations completed online. Large scale customs operations rely on a combination of trust and random and intelligence-led checks to ensure that what is in trucks matches what is on the customs declarations forms. Anything else? Yes, he is also proposing an all-island agri-food zone that would see Northern Ireland align with the EU laws which would apply south of the border. This would protect the dairy trade and that of meat including beef, lamb and chicken. Johnson has claimed this is a very big concession from the UK. How is it different from Theresa May’s agreement? The former prime minister’s plan involved a backstop policy that would apply across the entire UK including Britain in the event that talks on the future trading relationship broke down. This meant there would be no need for any Northern Ireland-only specific arrangements, no need for any checks anywhere near the border. The withdrawal agreement also involved a complex web of pledges on intangibles that would protect cross-border communities, including legally binding pledges to uphold all aspects of the Good Friday/Belfast agreement which includes a level of ministerial cooperation north/south and east/west. Will the EU buy it? This plan is dead on arrival. Ireland’s deputy prime minister dismissed it as a “non-starter”. In a tweet just before midnight he said it was time that the EU and Ireland had a “serious proposal”. Why is it such a problem? It is a big departure from May’s commitment that there would be no infrastructure on the border. It also pays little attention to the unique history and geography around the border, which is 310 miles long with 270 public cross border roads, many closed or cratered by the army during the troubles to stop traffic. It would risk the economic activity on both sides of the border and the social cohesion that has been built since the Good Friday/Belfast agreement 21 years ago. According to a parliamentary report 177,000 heavy goods and 208,000 light goods vehicles cross the border every month. Cross border communities warn that checks would not just cause inconvenience but risks dividing communities on each side of the border and shattering new relationships between previously divided communities. Will it fly with backbenchers? Many MPs have never engaged with the detail of the Irish border backstop or protocols in the withdrawal agreement on Northern Ireland and look to the Democratic Unionist party for their lead. The DUP has been consulted about the proposals and is likely to be in favour of them ahead of delivery (if this now happens) to Brussels. The eurosceptic European Research Group which includes the 28 so-called Spartans who voted against May’s deal three times, have also softened their opposition to the backstop and indicated they would consider a deal that involved a backstop as long as it meant the UK was “genuinely” free of all EU rule.
165	Boris Johnson has denied the UK government was proposing to install customs clearance zones several miles away from the Irish border after Brexit to get around the controversial backstop arrangement. The leaked plan, which appeared in the Irish media and has heightened concerns over a return to a hard border, was described as “not quite right” by the prime minister. But in a series of media interviews on Tuesday he would not explain what kind of Brexit plan he would be delivering to Brussels in the coming days, describing it only as “very good”. Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme if the string of customs checkpoints located five to 10 miles from the border in both Northern Ireland and Ireland was a possibility, Johnson said: “That is not what we are proposing at all.” He conceded there would ultimately need to be customs checks in some form, adding: “A sovereign united country must have a single customs territory … but there are plenty of ways we can facilitate north-south trade, plenty of ways we can address the problem.” He said the offer he planned on delivering to the EU was “very good” and would be revealed soon. It was set to include an “all-Ireland” regulation zone. The prime minister said: “If I may say so, the UK government has already made a very considerable offer and if you look at what we’re saying on the sanitary and phytosanitary arrangements – that is we are already accepting you could have a situation in which, as it were in Northern Ireland, the people are British but the cattle are Irish. “You have single territory for agriculture, for sanitary and phytosanitary, for agro-foods and that is a big concession by the UK government.” A Downing Street spokeswoman later reiterated the dismissal of the reports about the border plans: “What he was setting out is that nothing we are proposing involves checks or controls at the border, and that’s an absolute commitment.” The official proposals are expected to be outlined by No 10 later this week. The spokeswoman declined to say precisely when it would happen, or who would outline the ideas: “I’m not able to set out the chronology yet.” Should the UK end up with an extension to Brexit as mandated by the so-called Benn Act, he declined to rule out that Britain could use its veto to scupper legislation in Brussels. Just days ago he had said EU leaders would not want a “truculent and mutinous” UK to remain in the bloc and and they may refuse an extension. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said the UK may not “play nice” if it were locked in with the EU for months on end. Johnson said: “It’s a matter of common observation, the EU wants us to come out. I don’t think any purpose is served by corralling the UK against its will. “The EU wants, quite properly, from their own point of view, to proceed with various measures. They want to move towards a defence union, there’s a great deal of pressure to accelerate various projects that we think are not necessarily in the long-term interests of the UK.” He cited a fiscal union to support the euro as one piece of legislation that could have “considerable consequences in the UK”, which would not be favourably looked upon. The journalist Charlotte Edwardes’ claim that he groped her thigh during a lunch 20 years ago has overshadowed Johnson’s first Conservative party conference as leader, leading to questions about his behaviour towards women in every media interview he has done at the event. He told BBC Breakfast said: “I’ve said what I’ve said about that. They are not true. It’s obviously very sad someone should make such allegations.” As prime minister, he said the nature of his job meant he expected to “come under a certain amount of shot and shell”. He boasted of how under his tenure as mayor of London, his team had been a “feminocracy” and in his Radio 4 interview he claimed he was still the same “generous-hearted, loving, caring” person he was when he led the capital. “That person has not gone away. I am a one nation Tory but we are in a position where the only way we can move this country and unite our country again is get Brexit done.” The Benn Act, the legislation that compels Johnson to ask for an extension for Brexit if he is not able to strike a deal with Brussels by 2019, was described as a “constitutional novelty” by the prime minister. Controversially describing it again as the “surrender act”, he added fuel to the fire to reports that foreign governments may have been involved in its drafting. “We have no knowledge of how it was produced. It is not subject to normal parliamentary scrutiny. No one knows by whose advice it was drawn up,” he said. Asked by the Today presenter Nick Robinson about his remarks describing those MPs who worked on the bill as “collaborators”, he said: “I didn’t actually say collaborators. Go back over the quotation, I didn’t say collaborators.” Robinson interjected: “You said collaboration.” “Correct,” replied Johnson. “There are different connotations to different words and nobody knows how these bills are produced and with great respect to all my parliamentary colleagues we do need to work out how to scrutinise these things.”
166	A lawyer for R Kelly is calling for his release from prison on health grounds. Steve Greenberg says the R&amp;B star, currently in jail awaiting trial, is suffering from anxiety, an untreated hernia and numbness in one of his hands. In a New York court filing, Greenberg argues Kelly “is not presently receiving adequate medical care”. He also complains of other restrictions faced by Kelly: “His visits are severely restricted; presently, he is only allowed one unrelated person to visit. In other words, although he lives and has lived with two lady friends, only one of them is allowed to be on his visiting list, and after 90 days he is required to switch. No other friends or professional colleagues are allowed to visit. That is not right.” A hearing regarding the status of Kelly’s case has been set for 2 October. Kelly was arrested in July on two sets of sex-related charges, including coercion, physical abuse and sex with underage girls. In February, he had been arrested on 10 counts of sexual abuse, pleaded not guilty and was released on bail; he was charged with 11 further counts in May. After the fresh charges in July, bail was refused, and a trial date has been set for April 2020. The singer, once one of the most successful R&amp;B artists in the US, has always maintained his innocence. He has faced allegations of sexual abuse, often with girls below the age of consent, for decades, but has only once been brought to trial. In 2008, he was acquitted of producing child pornography after allegedly being filmed having sex with an underage girl.
167	Enable’s path to a third Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe success has become slightly smoother with the news that the Japanese star Deirdre will not oppose her on Sunday. A shock winner of the Nassau Stakes this summer and an unlucky fourth in the Irish Champion Stakes last time, Deirdre was seen by some observers as an interesting alternative to the hot favourite for the Longchamp race. Her connections, however, have decided against stumping up the six-figure sum required to enter her at Wednesday’s supplementary stage. Instead, Deirdre will add international lustre to British Champions Day at Ascot a fortnight on Saturday. “The plan is for Deirdre to go for the Champion Stakes,” said Oisin Murphy, who has ridden Mitsuru Hashida’s mare in her past two races. “Her connections are pleased with her since the Irish Champion Stakes, where she should have finished closer. She’s a very good mare and it’s great we are getting another opportunity to see her in Britain.” Deirdre is a general 16-1 shot for the Champion Stakes, the last of the 20-1 having disappeared during Monday. It is hard to be sure what quality of opposition she would face there as the top four in the betting – Japan, Magical, Ghaiyyath and Enable – are all expected to run in the Arc, so their presence at Ascot would depend on what happens this weekend. A tilt at the Breeders’ Cup in the US next month must be a possibility for Deirdre, especially as she is thought to appreciate fast ground. But Murphy believes Ascot is the main target for her owner and trainer, at least for the time being. There are 16 horses left in the Arc, following Monday’s declaration stage, including three Japanese representatives in Fierement, Blast Onepiece and Kiseki. Britain has the same number of possible runners in Enable, Mehdaayih and Ghaiyyath. Enable came safely through her final serious bit of work on Monday morning, when she covered seven furlongs on Newmarket’s Limekilns gallops. “Frankie [Dettori] was happy with her and hopefully we can get through the next six days,” her trainer, John Gosden, told the Racing Post. Meanwhile, Jean-Claude Rouget offered little help to punters as he discussed the Arc chances of his French Derby winner, Sottsass. “I am going into the Arc with confidence, but with a horse who has never encountered Enable, who has never encountered Japan, who has never really met anyone,” he said. “So I have no reference. I can’t say he is going to take his revenge or anything. I don’t know. What I do know is that the horse is looking good, he is in good form. Everything is all right.” Tuesday’s best bets Jumpers usually get a sound surface at Southwell but the overnight rain has made it soft in places there and that could be good news for Applaus (3.40), who put up a few good efforts on testing surfaces a couple of winters back. After a spell pointing, he’s back with Micky Hammond and a couple of modest efforts on good ground have got him down to an attractive rating. He’s 10lb below his last winning mark, so here’s hoping the mud and the fitting of blinkers spark a revival. At 14-1, it’s a chance I can take. At Sedgefield, there’s been some support for Squouateur (4.30), now 4-1 for the staying handicap hurdle. JP McManus’s grey has been backed, mostly unsuccessfully, for much better races than this in his time, of course, and it was only last year that he was third in the Kim Muir. His form since joining Ben Haslam does not encourage but the soft ground could make a difference and he is certainly on a fair mark. Irish raiders are always worth a second look at Ayr and Highway To Heaven (1.50) appeals at 6-1 in the opener. Her form last month at Gowran easily makes her a contender in this company. Sagittarius Rising (4.20) finished fast but just too late at Listowel last month on his fourth start for John McConnell. Support for a couple of others has allowed him to drift to 9-1, which seems too big.
168	Foreign minister Marise Payne has rejected suggestions Australia is being “dragged into a US political issue” as she defends the decision to assist Donald Trump’s probe into the Mueller inquiry. Following revelations on Tuesday that prime minister Scott Morrison had agreed to a request from Trump to assist the US justice department’s inquiry into the FBI’s investigation of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election, Payne said Australia was behaving as expected of an ally. “I don’t see it as Australia being dragged into a US political issue,” Payne told ABC radio. “We’re conducting ourselves as you would expect us to do in these circumstances, we are working in Australia’s interests and we are working with our closest and most important ally.” When asked what information Australia would be relaying to Attorney General William Barr who is leading the investigation, Payne did not elaborate. “In terms of material or information that would be exchanged, it is not my practice to comment on the use of intelligence, and secure material but as I said we’ll cooperate as far as we can,” she said. Labor leader Anthony Albanese called on the government to release the transcript of the call between Morrison and Trump, saying Australians needed a “full explanation” of what he said was an “extraordinary” offer. “The prime minister needs to just be straight with the Australian people about what’s going on here,” Albanese said. The government’s defence of its decision comes after revelations in Guardian Australia on Wednesday that Alexander Downer took the then prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and senior colleagues by surprise when he relayed information to the American chargé d’affaires in London in July 2016 about his now infamous conversation with George Papadopoulos, then a foreign policy adviser to Trump. Guardian Australia understands Downer’s conversation with Papadopoulos was recorded in a diplomatic cable back to Canberra. But the first senior players in Canberra knew of Downer’s conversation with America’s top diplomat in London about Russia obtaining damaging information about Hillary Clinton from her emails was when the Australian government was contacted subsequently by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for more information. That diplomat-to-diplomat conversation, sources insist, was unauthorised. Controversy about the conversations in 2016 has been revived courtesy of Donald Trump’s appeal to Scott Morrison for Australia’s assistance in an investigation aimed at discrediting the Mueller inquiry. The New York Times revealed on Tuesday that Trump made the call to Morrison shortly before the Australian prime minister departed for a visit to America last week. After the call was made public by the Times, Morrison’s office confirmed it. The conversation between the two leaders was, according to a government source, a “polite request” from Trump to cooperate with an investigation being spearheaded by the US attorney general, William Barr. Barr’s inquiry is an investigation of the investigators. Trump has given the attorney general the unilateral authority to declassify intelligence documents and has ordered the US intelligence community to “quickly and fully cooperate”. Trump in the call to Morrison sought a point of contact to facilitate Australia’s cooperation with Barr’s investigation. It is unclear what, if any, specific commitments Morrison has made in response to that request. Downer, a former foreign affairs minister during the Howard era, and at the time of his conversation with Papadopoulos, Australia’s high commissioner in London, told the ABC on Tuesday he had no knowledge of Morrison’s recent conversation with Trump. “These days it’s not something I am privy to,” Downer told the ABC. “I had a conversation with this guy [Papadopoulos], I passed on one element of the convo to the Americans. There is nothing more to it.” Labor is demanding answers. “I think Scott Morrison needs to be very clear about the circumstances around this phone call, what was said and whether any agreement was reached in terms of assistance,” the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said. “What Scott Morrison can’t do here is do what he’s had a tendency to do in recent times, which is to dismiss questions which are legitimate from the media as just gossip or as just being in the bubble. “He needs to actually give some straight answers to what are very clear questions.” Morrison did not appear before the media on Tuesday. Guardian Australia has contacted Downer for comment about the events of 2016 but the inquiries went unanswered. Trump is under escalating pressure in Washington with calls for his impeachment triggered by a separate conversation with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine. At the root of the gathering impeachment storm in the American capital is a complaint from a whistleblower – believed to be an intelligence official – that Trump was using the power of his presidential office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 election. It is unclear why Trump contacted Morrison in advance of his visit to secure Australia’s cooperation with the Barr investigation rather than raising it during the prime minister’s time in Washington. Morrison dead batted a reporter’s question during his visit about whether Downer had come up. “Well I’m not going to go into private conversations but what we were discussing yesterday were issues about our strategic relationship from trade,” he said. “The frontier technologies, our defence relationships, these were not issues that were there for discussion.” The dialogue between the Trump administration and the Morrison government about cooperation with the Barr investigation has apparently been playing out for some months. On 25 May, Trump blasted Australia before leaving on a trip to Japan, declaring he wanted Australia’s role in setting off the FBI inquiry into links between Russia and his election campaign examined by Barr. Trump said he hoped Barr would “look at the UK and I hope he looks at Australia and I hope he looks at Ukraine. I hope he looks at everything, because there was a hoax that was perpetrated on our country.” Australia’s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, then signalled the government was prepared to contribute to the Barr investigation. Payne said at the time Australia had not yet been asked but “we would, of course, consider such a request were it to be made”. After Trump’s comments, Australia’s ambassador to the US, Joe Hockey, wrote to Barr, copying in the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. In a letter released by the Australian government on Tuesday after the New York Times report, Hockey said: “The Australian government will use its best endeavours to support your efforts in this matter. “While Australia’s former high commissioner to the United Kingdom, the Hon Alexander Downer, is no longer employed by the government, we stand ready to provide you with all the relevant information to support your inquiries.”
169	When your love interest is basically a mirage, it’s hard to establish much human connection. That’s the conundrum for French choreographer Angelin Preljocaj in La Fresque, based on an old Chinese tale of a man who falls in love with a woman in a painting and is transported into the world of the picture. What Preljocaj does capture very effectively is a dream state that grows increasingly hypnotic as the beat pulses on. The soundtrack from Air’s Nicolas Godin hops from simmering synth to west African groove to an outbreak of manic harpsichord, and, rather than build a single choreographic voice, Preljocaj shifts the character of the dance as each scene sheds its skin. It’s like waking into a new dream: one where dancers melt in jellified curves, one with slicing lines and pointed toes, one where they bounce en masse to the beat. The individual steps are not always inspired, but the mood is conjured. Symbolising youthful beauty, hair is a major theme, whether tossed in sharp flicks of the head by the sirens in the painting (a la Rosas danst Rosas), tied into a marital knot (in homage to Bronislava Nijinska’s Les Noces, surely), or woven into a long rope reaching up to the ceiling that men climb up in a reverse Rapunzel. And it’s in the mesmerising projections by Constance Guisset, a sort of giant jellyfish made of fine, flowing strands. It all looks fab, expensive, gorgeous, including the bronze warrior catsuits and floaty, strappy dresses of Azzedine Alaïa’s costumes. The somewhat hollow journey of La Fresque may not teach us much, but this is a great-looking show that does have its moments of magic. • At Sadler’s Wells, London, until 2 October.
170	Alicia Keys ft Miguel – Show Me Love The video for this track is dubbed a “visual sonic installation” and stars the song’s duetting singers, plus Zoe Saldana and her husband Marco Perego Saldana, and Michael B Jordan, all doing balletic things with water, paint and each other. It’s beautiful and rather grand, unlike the song, which is beautiful but much more understated. Over gently swaying acoustic guitar, Alicia and Miguel coo sweet nothings to each other in a gorgeous, timeless melody, the kind of thing that sounds improvised by Keys just sitting at the piano and playing. This relaxed, unforced mood hopefully suffuses her incoming seventh album. BBT Angel Olsen – Lark It’s hard to think of another contemporary singer who time-travels as convincingly as Angel Olsen. Her debut sounded as though it had been recorded by lamplight in a poorly insulated shack; later records reinvigorated classic rock’n’roll and weepies worthy of Roy Orbison. On Lark, she harnesses high romanticism, the lux drama of classic Hollywood. It’s a hard sound to land without veering into pastiche, let alone to hold one’s own amid the heavy arrangements. But Olsen commands the scene. She teases out the details of a relationship that crumbled into the void of disconnection, the soft production accruing a potent charge. Then the tension snaps: “What about my dreams?” she howls, addressing a former lover who failed to see her for who she truly was. As the strings go off like a fireworks display comprised entirely of screamer rockets, the blinkered sod is left in no uncertain terms about the magnitude of her desires. LS DaBaby – Intro The rap breakthrough of the year award has to go to DaBaby, who has just released Kirk, his second album of 2019 following the excellent Baby on Baby. The first album was mostly fixated on guns, wealth and – as track titles such as Carpet Burn and Baby Sitter allude – shagging. But Intro announces that Kirk is rather more soul-searching. With his HD alpha-male delivery, DaBaby tells of his pre-fame poverty, and the pain of his father dying at the same time that he finally became successful. It prompts a reflection on the enduring power of family and friendship even through the complicating factors of newfound fame and wealth. BBT Touché Amoré – Deflector This LA post-hardcore five-piece aren’t so much in touch with their feelings as sending them a constant stream of extremely earnest WhatsApps. A decade into their career, they follow their recently rerecorded debut with this first track from their forthcoming new album, and the lyrics from frontman Jeremy Bolm are almost self-parodic in their emo-ness: “A last responder to my own self interest … Cold-shouldered by design,” he laments. “I’m a secondhand piano / Incapable of tune / Providing the score / For gone too soon.” But boy, does he sell them – the chorus would be anthemic sung by anyone, but is made gloriously so by Bolm’s acute feeling. BBT Brittany Howard – Goat Head It’s tough to pick a standout from Brittany Howard’s remarkable debut solo album, Jaime. But even on this intimate, exposing record, Goat Head cuts deeper than everything else. It’s a break from the album’s diffuse blues, hooked instead around a lilting piano loop. Howard layers it as she assembles her child’s-eye understanding of colour: first learning red from green, the way your parents teach you. Then, starker differences: having a white mother and a black father in a southern town, and how that prompted a hate crime; slashed tyres, a goat’s head on the back seat. The stumbling joins in the looped piano become fissures as the younger Howard becomes painfully cognisant of the world’s gaping inconsistencies; more unsettling is how Howard and her backing vocalists turn “goat head in the back” into a sensual, soothing refrain. LS Mary Lattimore – Quintana Left over from the recording of her 2018 album Hundreds of Days, Quintana finds harpist Mary Lattimore at her most expansive and melancholy. Her glassy playing is subsumed by static fog, which, across 15 eventful minutes, swells and eddies, blurring the precision of her playing and building to an unexpected bass note that hits like a cataclysmic omen. The track also calls to mind the imposing tundras of Canadian drone composer Tim Hecker’s defining Ravedeath, 1972. Given that it’s an outtake from an album with which it has little in common, it’s hard to tell whether it indicates a new creative horizon or an abandoned idea for Lattimore. Either way, its bittersweet beauty and lingering sense of doom feels arrestingly contemporary for this moment in the climate crisis. LS (Sandy) Alex G – Southern Sky Although he was recently and no doubt mendaciously mistaken for Beto O’Rourke by right-wing trolls, (Sandy) Alex G could never actually mount a credible Democratic candidacy campaign – he’s so horizontally chill you can barely imagine him mounting his stairs most days. But that demeanour has made the singer-songwriter – and Frank Ocean’s sometime guitarist – one of the best of his generation, with songs that rarely resolve in the way you expect them to. Southern Sky, from excellent new album House of Sugar, is the perfect entry point to his catalogue, with its Beach Boys-style naivety to the vocals and the playground-chant melody in the outro. BBT Lou Rebecca – Desire Texas-based French pop auteur Lou Rebecca trades in fantasy: she makes dreamy lounge pop that’s as featherlight as a pink macaron, her sexy-baby vocals in debt to countrywoman Brigitte Bardot. (It’s been a good year for it. See also: Swiss singer Vendredi sur Mer’s debut, Premiers Emois.) But the fantasy is all hers. On Desire, she beseeches a lover to get closer, tell her everything, says she’ll be anything they want. But her plan, it turns out, is more Villanelle than Valentine: “Je plante mes crocs dans ta chair,” she coos – I’ll sink my fangs into your flesh – taking revenge against men who treat women like wish-fulfilment machines. They should have seen it coming: the insouciant yet relentless disco beat speaks to a strategic mind hard at work behind the deceptively sugary facade. LS James Massiah – Natural Born Killers (Ride for Me) Set in an equatorial city, the gripping video for south London poet/rapper James Massiah’s debut single depicts people struggling to go about their everyday business in apocalyptic heat – so hot that an egg frying on the pavement becomes an omen for their fate. The track is as cool as the clip is sweltering: Massiah connects the threads from eski to dancehall and the slower end of acid house, unspooling a nonchalant devotional amid a cocky bassline and glacial, ravey synths that sparkle enticingly. LS Toshifumi Hinata – Atarashii Yuhbokumin Japanese ambient is the latest frontier in reissue culture: following the Kankyō Ongaku compilation earlier this year, and albums by Yutaka Hirose, Midori Takada, Takashi Kukobo and Hiroshi Yoshimura all recently returning to circulation, next up is Toshifumi Hinata, whose best bits have been collected as the album Broken Belief this month by the Music from Memory label. There are big synth-y fantasias, drifting chordscapes and pristine piano notes, but the best moments are the more fleshed-out rhythm tracks. Atarashii Yuhbokumin has a bossa nova energy to its drum machine pulse, creating a sensual space for its affecting central piano melody and jazzy bass solo. BBT
171	Diego Armando Maradona’s life is a cliché, a rags to riches tragedy. He started as a poor boy with no filter, one whose ruthless drive and innate skill took him to greatness, before a sudden fall. Had he been watching, Andy Warhol would have been enthralled. Asif Kapadia, who won an Oscar for Amy, another documentary about a scintillating talent who came crashing to earth, is the man behind a new film about Maradona. In the film, titled Maradona, Kapadia slices through the persisting myth of D10S, attempting to free Diego the man from Maradona the legend. After a limited theatrical release, HBO brings the film to US audiences this week. America missed his legend, catching him at perhaps his lowest low, when he flamed out of the 1994 World Cup after a failed drugs test. In the US, he was a hero to only a few – and I was one of them. As a teenage Argentinian immigrant in the United States in the early 2000s, struggling to reconcile my cultural identity with my new country, I clung to Maradona. He was Platonic Argentinianess, and I found in his legend the answers I sought. His was a greatness to strive for and a perseverance to mimic. His legend held what the teenage me saw as answers about masculinity (be brash, work hard and be a leader) and sportsmanship (forget about it). Sure, lessons can be found in any world-class athlete, but with Maradona they all came wrapped in an albiceleste bow of patriotism. His success was Argentina’s and by extension mine, decades and thousands of miles away from his heyday. His brilliant goals, his breathtaking skills, his trophies, his literal single-handed demolition of England in 1986 – they were mine too. He validated my reverence for a culture that I was separated from and gave me a love I could share with the only other Argentinian teenager in a neighborhood that was mostly Venezuelan and Colombian. As a kid, I looked past his drug addiction and involvement with the mafia. Now, the reality of Maradona’s past, which Kapadia skilfuly peels back, is undeniable. Maradona’s present raises even more worrying questions. Now, after a decade-long absence, Diego (or is it Maradona?) is back in Argentina, to start another chapter. He has taken a job as the manager of embattled Gimnasia y Esgrima, a club languishing near the bottom of the Argentinian Superliga. For Gimnasia supporters, the excitement is real. But despite his insistence that he’s back in Argentina to work (“I am no magician”, he told supporters at his presentation) the motives behind Maradona’s return are opaque. Some argue that it is no coincidence that Maradona is using his fame to bring attention to the club, following the Argentinian tradition of using football as a distraction in times of political instability. Giselle Fernandez, sister of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, the former president and current vice-presidential candidate for Argentina’s opposition party Frente Para Todos, gifted Maradona a rosary carrying a locket. Inside, was a picture of her mother. Maradona is an avowed Kirchnerist and Fernandez is an ardent Gimnasia supporter. It’s unclear how much business the Fernandez family have tied up in the club – if any – but Noticias, an Argentinian weekly magazine, reported that the club expects to make $3m from sponsorship this season. In the 10 days after the announcement, the club sold 6m pesos ($105,000) worth of jerseys. The footballer who helped me love my country may be a willing pawn to distract Argentina’s citizens in the critical upcoming elections. Or, perhaps it’s just a club taking the risky bet that he can harvest the same success he had as a player. Kapadia shows us a frightened Maradona. A man who allowed his legend to consume his life, ultimately destroying him. Is Maradona falling into another loop in which he attaches himself to power to feed his need to be loved, leading to his own demise? Does he even realise he is doing this? Still, there are some lessons from Maradona I hold dear – his perseverance and drive. Other, more negative ones, I’ve cast aside. As time passes Maradona’s myth will continue to change. The only certainty is that the image we have of Maradona is the same as that of Marilyn Monroe, Elvis or any other subject of Warhol’s diptychs: a fiction. We can take the lessons we want – or leave them.
172	Ferrari’s luxurious problem Sebastian Vettel may have copped the attention and flak for refusing to obey team orders but at its heart this was a problem Ferrari created and failed to deal with well. Their attempt to micromanage the start in the form of an agreement that Charles Leclerc would switch back to the lead if he gave Vettel a slipstream was unnecessarily complex. Nor did it allow for what happened when Vettel made a superb start and then showed great pace. Ferrari, however, were stuck with their plan and immediately tried to implement it. It was too rigid a reaction when they could have let it play out longer and swap them later in the race, as they ultimately did. With both championships in effect gone, what is extraordinary is that they are still trying to run their men to a script rather than letting them race. Vettel will doubtless believe he was right to refuse to slow down and Leclerc that the German went back on an agreement – a recipe for disharmony – but their team principal, Mattia Binotto, chose to look on the bright side. “I still believe it’s a luxury,” he said. “We have got two fantastic drivers, therefore that’s where I’m starting from.” Corriere dello Sport was perhaps closer to the truth with their headline: “Ferrari, this is war” Mercedes make hay towards title The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, knows only too well how quickly such situations can become toxic. He has explained in the past how Lewis Hamilton’s relationship with Nico Rosberg deteriorated to such an extent it had a negative effect on the team. “It shows you that it isn’t trivial at all to manage two drivers that have the aspiration to win. As a team we have been through this and it’s certainly not easy,” he said in Sochi. What Mercedes displayed in contrast was another masterclass in maximising their position. Their strategy choice was bold on the medium tyres and Hamilton exploited it perfectly. They were lucky with the virtual safety car and Vettel’s MGU-K failure but had ensured they were there to take advantage. Wolff’s reaction was a lesson for Ferrari. “The result shows you must never give up, even if you go into the race with a package that is not the quickest,” he said. “If you do things right, all of those things, the drivers, the engineers and the management, then you can still win races.” Albon on and on Alexander Albon had not been enjoying the best of weekends for Red Bull. He was unhappy with the feel of his car through practice and then crashed in qualifying. He then made setup changes that meant he had to start from the pit lane. When it mattered, however, he found his form superbly. From 20th he finished fifth, having driven through the field. He was lucky with the timing of the safety car but what really stood out were the passes he pulled off to come back, making bold moves against Daniil Kvyat, Pierre Gasly, Kevin Magnussen and Carlos Sainz. The London-born Thai was in only his fourth race for Red Bull and he is already only 17 points behind Gasly, whom he replaced and who had 12 races with Red Bull to amass his score. Sixth in the championship is in Albon’s sights and this performance has surely all but sealed his seat for Red Bull next season. New formats still unloved F1’s sporting director, Ross Brawn, insisted the proposals for changing the qualifying format next season at two or three races had “unanimous support” from the teams. The drivers, however, seemed equally united in their scepticism for a host of potential changes coming with the 2021 regulations. The most controversial proposal is that of reverse grid qualifying, which Hamilton once again dismissed. “The fact they are trying the reverse grid feels like an excuse for not doing a good enough job,” he said. He and other drivers have stressed there would be no need for such an idea if the cars were better able to race and aired fundamental fears for 2021. “We are moving to worse tyres, heavier cars and being more sluggish. And when you speak to these guys who are making the rules they just don’t understand. Pretty much all of them haven’t raced or even been in a F1 car.” Their objections have been noted, Brawn said, but F1 seems almost certain at least to try the reverse grid concept next season – an experiment worth making before committing to any wholesale changes. Tight run-in for midfield engine room For Mercedes concluding a sixth drivers’ and constructors’ championship double now seems inevitable. They will probably tie up the latter at the next round in Japan and Hamilton is on course to seal his sixth title in Mexico. He is ahead of Valtteri Bottas by 73 points and a lead of 78 after the subsequent Mexican Grand Prix will be enough. Ferrari’s improved form looks now to be enough to head off Red Bull for second but the midfield still has much to play for. McLaren in fourth have now broken 100 points – the first time the team have done so since 2014. They announced this weekend they would be switching to Mercedes engines in 2021, ditching the current supplier, Renault, whom they lead by 33 points. The French marque desperately wants fourth but will need a mighty effort to catch McLaren. However, only 17 points now separate Renault from Toro Rosso and Racing Point. Every one scored for all four will be vital – the midfield fight will be tooth and nail from here on in.
173	With a general election looming, Boris Johnson has sanctioned a multibillion-pound spending programme announced at the Conservative party conference. Ministers have promised investment in the transport system, NHS and digital infrastructure in an attempt to stimulate economic growth and win back erstwhile Tory voters. But there are concerns the party has jettisoned its reputation for fiscal rectitude. In March, the then chancellor, Philip Hammond, said it was necessary to hold back fiscal reserves to cope with a no-deal Brexit. He could have spent £26.6bn over the life of the parliament without breaching a self-imposed rule to limit the annual spending deficit to 2% of GDP, but instead chose to keep the funds in reserve. Hammond’s successor, Sajid Javid, pledged last month to increase public spending by £13.8bn as part of a one-year spending review. Police, hospitals and local government were all big winners as Javid claimed the government had turned the page on 10 years of austerity. But this package ate up almost half the Treasury’s fiscal headroom. Last week, the Office for National Statistics said the government would need to write off £12bn of student debt, which would take up almost all the rest of the £26.6bn. Now Javid wants to spend more money on public services, tearing up the 2% deficit rule and leaving the government - which is also coping with lower tax receipts after a fall in GDP growth – with no option but to ramp up borrowing in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Here are the spending pledges made so far: Hospitals A pledge to spend £13bn to build 40 new hospitals is more accurately £2.7bn for six NHS trusts, which had plans already in place for hospitals in need of rebuilding. The rest of the building programme starts with £100m in “seed funding” to help 21 trusts develop plans to rebuild or construct 34 hospitals, including up to a dozen community hospitals in Dorset. There is also £3bn in addition to an already announced £1.8bn tranche of funding for NHS building repairs. The remaining projects would be completed over the second half of the next decade. In all, the government hopes to spend another £33.9bn on the NHS each year by 2023, though much of this was already in the Treasury’s projections and to some extent simply accounts for rising inflation. Infrastructure The government will allocate more than £25bn to the strategic road network over the next five years, with 14 major roads to be upgraded. Hammond increased spending on roads in his previous budgets, meaning many of the 14 projects, such as making the entirety of the A66 transpennine road a dual carriageway, have already been unveiled. Broadband Javid will commit £5bn to improving fast broadband access in harder-to-reach parts of the country. All but £200m of the funds to strengthen full-fibre and 5G internet networks had not been previously announced. However, Labour said that according to the National Infrastructure Commission, building and maintaining a national full-fibre network would cost more than £33bn. Transport/buses Mostly announced at the time of the spending review, plans are in place to create two all-electric bus towns as part of a £220m package of funding. About £30m will be spent on improving existing routes and restoring previously cancelled services, and £20m will be spent on developing new “on-demand” bus services to make them more flexible. Since 2010, government subsidies to bus companies have been cut by 45% and more than 3,000 bus routes have been forced to close. Police Javid said there would be a 6.3% increase in Home Office spending in real terms, amounting to £750m, to fund the first year of the government’s plan to recruit 20,000 new police officers. There will also be an extra £45m provided so recruitment can start immediately, with the intention of having 2,000 officers in place by the end of March. He also announced a 5% real-terms increase in the resources budget for the Ministry of Justice, as well as confirming an extra £80m for the Crown Prosecution Service. Local government Ministers have promised the largest increase next year in local government spending power since 2010. Councils will receive £1.5bn for social care to “help stabilise the system”. A 2% council tax levy will be used to raise £500m. Javid said there would be £54m of new funding to address homelessness and rough sleeping, and £241m next year to help regenerate high streets. Environment The chancellor said there would be £432m in additional funds for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to tackle climate issues. Education School spending will increase over three years by £7.1bn, though government claims that every secondary school will be allocated a minimum of £5,000 for each pupil next year are widely disputed. Critics say no-deal Brexit planning has denied all departments the time to deliver fresh spending, including £700m to support children with special educational needs next year. Defence An extra £2.2bn next year means a real-terms increase of 2.6% to ensure defence spending stays above the Nato target level of 2% of GDP. Minimum wage The public sector directly employs 5.4 million people and many more indirectly to provide essential services. About 4 million people will benefit from an increase in the “national living wage” from £8.21 an hour to £10.50 an hour by 2024. Javid’s plan also lowers the age limit at which people can receive the national living wage from 25 to 21. The Treasury said it did not know how much the public sector wage bill was likely to increase by as a result, though it admitted there would be a rise. However, workers and employers will pay higher levels of national insurance, offsetting the cost.
174	Labor has asked the auditor general to investigate the government’s claimed $7bn in drought assistance, saying the response has been “ad hoc, confusing and lacking in direction”. As the government defends the roll-out of its drought package, which saw one regional council receive $1m in taxpayer support despite enjoying good rainfall, Labor’s shadow agriculture minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, has written to the auditor general, Grant Hehir, requesting a full audit. He said an inquiry into all drought funding initiatives since 2014 was needed to ensure they had been “both effective in assisting farmers and rural communities and are delivering value for taxpayers”. The request also asks Hehir to look at the criteria underpinning the Drought Communities Program which has excluded some local government areas “that were clearly more drought-affected than some that were included”. This is in reference to the Moyne council in south-west Victoria which is expected to reject the $1m grant. “As large parts of Australia suffer the worst drought on record, the government’s response has been ad hoc, confusing and lacking in direction,” Fitzgibbon said on Tuesday. “Farmers and rural communities are tiring of prime ministerial drought tours, empty talk about dams, exaggerated funding announcements and now, what appears to be political favouritism and pork barrelling.” The government has been under pressure over its drought assistance measures since minister David Littleproud told parliament that the government would not release reports written by the special envoy on the drought, Barnaby Joyce, nor a report prepared by the government’s drought coordinator, Major General Stephen Day. Despite Littleproud saying no report existed in relation to Joyce’s work, the former Nationals leader has said he sent an “awful lot” of correspondence relating to his role, including 1,500-word text messages. On Tuesday, Joyce hit back at critics of his role, including Fitzgibbon, accusing the shadow agriculture minister of neglecting to visit drought-affected communities. “I think it is only fair enough that Mr Fitzgibbon answer – where is his trip to Dubbo? Where is his trip to Longreach? Where is his trip to Charters Towers? “The only trips I can see all bar one are near the coast – these are the the seats that the Labor party were trying to win at the election.” Fitzgibbon has questioned what value taxpayers received from the Joyce appointment, which cost taxpayers $675,000 over a nine-month period, including Joyce’s normal activities as a backbencher, but excluding his salary and that of two extra staff assigned to the role.
175	Growing up between abandoned buildings and empty lots, Xavier Usanga brought love and affection whenever he could. Those who knew him say he gave off joy like it was a superpower, enveloping everyone he knew in the glow. Last month, a day before starting second grade, the seven-year-old was shot dead in crossfire outside his home. His story is grimly familiar in St Louis, Missouri, a city of more than 300,000 that sits on the west bank of the Mississippi River and where 13 black children have been fatally shot since April. Had those 13 children died in one fast hail of bullets, that tally would rank in the nation’s 20 deadliest mass shootings. If they had been white, it is likely they would have had more media attention. Instead, these children died in the dilapidated parts of town most people are told to avoid – sometimes alone, sometimes as family stood helplessly by. In these corners of the city, parents tell their children the loud banging outside is fireworks, but because it is really gunfire, they don’t let them outside to see. Xavier was in his backyard. He was heading back from a neighbor’s house with two of his older sisters – Trinity, 10, and Angel, 12 – when gunshots rang out. The girls ran into their home, where they realized Xavier wasn’t with them, and turned back and found his body under a bush. They told their grandmother he took a deep breath and was gone. Michael Johnson, a pastor who helped support the family, was close to Xavier and was with his mother to help identify the body. Johnson said Xavier was “a sponge for love – he needed it, he absorbed it”. “He would never walk into a room without coming to give you a hug, whether you saw him an hour earlier or you saw him two weeks ago,” Johnson said. “He always came, looked at you, and smiled and wanted a hug.” Xavier’s mother, Dawn Usanga, told the Guardian that Xavier “lit up every room he walked into” and was popular with many people in their neighborhood. “For seven years old, I don’t know, he was just so innocent, he was sweet, everybody just took to him,” she said. “I think the only thing that gives me any kind of comfort is that St Louis never got to ruin my son,” Usanga said. “Anything could have gotten to him – drugs, the violence, the guns, influences of other kids. Children can get turned around so fast and get running and do the wrong things.” ‘More access to guns than wallets in their back pockets’ For at least four years of Xavier’s short life, St Louis has been the murder capital of the US. It has had the highest gun homicide rate per capita of any big city since 2014. This violence disproportionately affects the city’s poor black neighborhoods, and this year children as young as two have become a symbol for how entrenched the city is in violence. St Louis county, the suburbs which border the city, have also seen a high child murder rate with seven children shot dead. St Louis’s mayor, Lyda Krewson, has offered $25,000 for information on four of the dead children’s cases, a grand total of $100,000. The city is also planning to spend $500,000 on the lauded crime reduction program, Cure Violence, and another $1.5m on violence prevention efforts. The city also has programs to provide food, recreation and jobs to low-income people, as well as large-scale efforts to demolish derelict homes. This year, St Louis plans to tear down 700 homes, and has programs that allow people to purchase homes for $1. “It’s a multipronged effort, but we all know this violence is a function of generational poverty and a lack of opportunity and it’s something that St Louis is not immune to just like all these other cities,” said Koran Addo, director of communications for the office of the mayor. Missouri’s governor, Mike Parson, announced on 19 September that the state would deploy more police to the area and provide prosecutorial assistance. This plan of “targeting violent criminals and getting them off the street” does not include any changes to the state’s lax gun laws, which allow people to carry handguns and rifles without a permit. There is a deep distrust of police in the city and people in the affected neighborhoods said they can’t see a way out of the problem without addressing the lack of jobs, neglected buildings and drug addiction. And because guns are so easily purchased illegally, there is little faith that strengthening the state’s weak gun control laws would resolve the issue. “More young men have access to guns than wallets in their back pockets,” said James Clark, vice-president of community outreach for the not-for-profit Better Family Life. “That’s a major issue, but now, it’s one thing to have a gun, it’s another thing to be willing to pull that trigger.” Clark said family and community structures in the city’s impoverished neighborhoods have disintegrated so much that things have become more violent, fueled by a lack of hope and support. Better Family Life runs a gun violence de-escalation program, providing mediation in interpersonal conflicts that could result in gun violence, and a Clean Sweep program that works to demolish abandoned and blighted buildings that have overtaken the city’s poorest neighborhoods. “The root cause of violence is poverty. It took us 10 years to all agree on that. It will take at least three generations to eradicate poverty, at least three, and that’s if we started right now,” Clark said. ‘A nightmare that you can’t get over’ This constant stream of violence meant that when the first of the 13 children was gunned down this year, there were a few local news reports, then most of the city moved on. But as the numbers rose, with children getting caught in crossfire while playing outside their houses or killed inside their own homes, the anxiety grew. The first and youngest child to die this year in St Louis city was two-year-old Kayden Johnson. He and his mother, Trina’ty Riley, were found dead in their home in May. Elijah Johnson, the father of the child, told KMOV4 that he was heartbroken after the shooting. “Just a lot of pain, it was unbelievable,” Johnson said. “I could not believe it.” There have been no public developments in the case on who killed Kayden and his mother, nor has their been much progress in finding who is responsible for the other deaths. Only one of the cases have seen someone charged with homicide – the killing of Sentonio Cox, 15. Sentonio, who was retreating with his hands up when he was shot, according to court papers, was found with multiple gunshot wounds in a lot down the street from his home. He was the second of his mother’s six children to be fatally shot. “It’s like a nightmare that you can’t get over, like a bottomless pit,” Roxyzanna Edwards, his mother, told KSDK. Police have charged two men, aged 47 and 54, with Sentonio’s murder. The same weekend Sentonio was killed, Nyla Banks, 10, and Jurnee Thompson, eight, were also fatally shot. No one has been charged in the deaths of the two young girls. Kim Gardner, the circuit attorney for the city of St Louis, said the city and state needed to take this systemic cycle of trauma into account to combat gun violence. “We can’t arrest our way out of this, we can’t prosecute our way out of this. We have to figure out why a person is picking up a gun and shooting into a crowd,” she said. She is the first black female prosecutor in St Louis and has faced severe criticism while promoting progressive criminal justice reform. The state has prioritized policing in responding to gun violence, and directly challenged efforts to address poverty, such as when Missouri’s government voted to lower the minimum wage from $10 to $7.90 an hour in 2017 (voters passed a law in November 2018 to increase it again). In the past decade, Missouri has also made it easier for people to obtain guns. In the state, anyone 19 or older can legally carry a concealed weapon without a concealed-carry permit or any training. These changes coincided with a 16% increase in homicides over a six-year period where the nationwide gun homicide rate decreased. Ferguson protests T-Dubb-O, a rapper and activist born and raised in the city, said he wishes people had another way to solve their problems than violence, but when he was shooting at people and being shot at as a teenager, it was often the only way to keep himself alive. The number of illegal weapons flooding the streets would not be changed much by stricter laws, said T-Dubbo-O, who said he doesn’t leave the house without a gun. He, like others, also doesn’t think it would address the underlying issues driving someone to use a gun to resolve a conflict. “I can’t say why somebody shouldn’t do what they do if they feel hopelessness, I don’t know their mental state or how to stop that, but what I do know is we can stop those conditions,” he said. He does outreach with the group HandsUp United, a collective which provides food, technical classes and social justice education to the community. As a father of four, T-Dubb-O is also focused on keeping his children away from the chains of poverty. “I don’t care what I have to do,” he said. “Even if it means going back to selling drugs. I’ll make sure I have life insurance, and if somebody kills me, then they’ll have enough money to survive and go off to a nice college and I got a wonderful woman who will make sure they go at it in the correct way.” T-Dubb-O and his partner, Rika Tyler, were part of the uprising in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis which attracted international attention in August 2014 after a white police officer, Darren Wilson, fatally shot the unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown. Tyler lived five minutes away from where Brown was killed and went to the scene as the teenager’s body lay in the street for four hours. She said the intense protests that followed were about more than just Brown: it was an expression of frustration with how the black community in St Louis, and across the US, encounters more policing, fewer job opportunities, worse health outcomes and lower-quality schools. “It was just the straw that broke the people’s back,” Tyler said. A long history of racial discrimination and segregation Missouri hosted one of the most prominent legal controversies about slavery when Dred Scott, enslaved at birth, fought slavery in the US supreme court. The court ruled in 1857 that Scott and other African Americans cannot be considered American citizens, setting up course for the civil war. In the early 1900s, just 50 years after slavery was abolished in the US, St Louis voted in favor of an ordinance that prevented someone from moving into a neighborhood if it was predominantly home to people of another race. Though the supreme court struck down the ordinance, city planners had families in certain neighborhoods sign documents saying they would never sell to an African American family. Housing discrimination was outlawed in 1968 but in practice segregation persists. Weaving between blocks in St Louis, and the suburbs that surround it in St Louis county, the racial and class divides are blatant. In the city’s JeffVanderLou neighborhood, the life expectancy is 18 years lower than it is in the nearby wealthy, majority-white suburbof Clayton, according to a 2014 report. In Clayton, which is in St Louis county, 78% of residents are white and the median household income is $90,000, while in JeffVanderLou 95% are black and the median household income is $15,000. Drive about nine minutes from the city’s ritzy Central West End and the clothing boutiques, artisanal ice-cream shops and cafes quickly give way to crumbled homes and emptied streets. Sex workers and people with drug addictions occupy the playgrounds and children are mostly kept indoors. Yolanda Whittier, a 29-year-old mother of two, said she could move out of a neighborhood where shootouts happen outside their front door, to one where you can only hear the sound of bullets, if she got a job that paid an extra $200-$250 a week. She was offered such a position, but couldn’t take it after failing the required eye exam because she hasn’t been able to afford glasses since losing her security guard job in May. “I never thought I’d be living like this,” she said, as her five-year-old, Mark, and three-year-old, Kenzi, buzzed around her legs. When Whittier pulls back the heavy, dark curtains covering her living room windows, she sees one potential answer to some of the problems in her community. An unusually manicured lawn and newly built apartment building stand facing an old home that looks like it has been bombed. “Better buildings, better people,” she said. ‘Even if he killed my baby, he’s still my baby’ Seven-year-old Xavier’s case is also one of the few to lead to an arrest. Malik Ross, 27, was arrested for theft and told police he shot Xavier accidentally after seeing men with a gun on a nearby porch. “It was them or me,” he told police. He has not been charged with the murder. Xavier’s grandmother, Mary Norwood, has lived in Ferguson for 12 years, a few blocks from where Brown was killed on West Florissant Avenue. She avoids driving down the busy thoroughfare because it still reminds her of the smoke, smell and noise from the weeks of protests. For 66 years, she has watched family and friends go to prison, struggle with addiction and drop dead. One nephew was fatally shot by police and Norwood was addicted to drugs and alcohol until 1993. A survivor of domestic abuse, she is now studying for her third master’s degree. After Xavier was shot, Norwood took care of her youngest granddaughters, who witnessed the shooting, while their parents were at the hospital, inconsolable after his death. Norwood said the trio of kids “had more energy than the law allows” and were known in the neighborhood as the “welcoming committee” because they would greet new neighbors and share what they learned with the rest of the neighborhood. “He was a spunky little boy, he was so outgoing.” Norwood fears for the man responsible for Xavier’s death. “I am a mother of the race,” she said. “Even if he killed my baby, he’s still my baby.” She is worried that if the assailant goes to prison, he will be put on a path of more destruction and suffering. “If nothing came out of Xavier’s death except the young man was able to look and see the error of his ways and that changed him in some kind of way, then Xavier’s death wasn’t in vain,” Norwood said.
176	A former English teacher is suing offshore detention operator Broadspectrum for “devastating” ill health caused by black mould in her accomodation while she was on Nauru teaching asylum seekers and refugees. The case, which joins ongoing fallout from a years-long issue with dangerous mould at the offshore immigration detention centre in Nauru, went before the Queensland supreme court on Tuesday afternoon. In an affidavit filed to the court and seen by Guardian Australia, 68-year-old Dorothy McDonald said she was made to live in a room with “black, sticky and hairy” mould and was denied requests to move elsewhere. She said the months of “significant” exposure over a fly-in-fly-out work schedule had left her with debilitating health complaints including chronic fatigue, headaches and difficulties with concentration and memory. McDonald said she has been unable to work since returning from Nauru in November 2015. “Being an English teacher, I always prided myself on my ability to articulate my thoughts,” she said. “It feels like an integral part of who I was has been taken from me and is now gone.” According to the McDonald affidavit, she was employed by the Salvation Army and then Transfield – now known as Broadspectrum – between January 2013 and November 2015. McDonald said she spent about 18 months in demountable cabins and her complaint stemmed largely from two rooms she lived in for 11 months in 2015. After complaining of mould in one room, McDonald said she was moved to another which she said quickly became far worse. The previous room, which she had lived in for about six months, was closed permanently, she said. She said both rooms had only one permanently shut window, and she was made to keep the air conditioners set at 22C, a contrast which felt “like a freezer” compared with the 30C to 40C temperatures outside, she said. “I recall seeing the condensation mix with the mould and slide down the wall, leaving a black streak on the wall,” she said. She said she asked to move several times, but was told accommodation was at a premium and there was no other option. An accomodation officer told her to just wash the walls, she said. According to McDonald’s affidavit, her symptoms worsened, including itchy eyes, fevers, disturbed sleep, headaches and sinusitis. Her symptoms improved during a brief trip to the UK, and on return trips to Australia, but she said they worsened each time she came back to Nauru, and expanded to include fatigue and a “significant change in my concentration and cognitive function”. “I had difficulty remembering words and names. I also had difficulty using the computer system,” she said. In October 2015 she was hospitalised in Nauru with a respiratory infection and was flown to Australia, where she said she continues to suffer from chronic fatigue as well as concentration and memory problems. “My symptoms continue to be devastating,” she said. “My life has changed irrevocably. I am not the person I was before.” McDonald, who is being represented by Maurice Blackburn lawyers, has previously sought and won compensation for the same complaint through a New South Wales-based claim against Transfield, which was sent to arbitration. Her affidavit notes that she was fired from Transfield in 2016 for “gross misconduct” – specifically, sharing articles on Facebook. On Tuesday the case was adjourned amid disagreement over which jurisdiction applied. McDonald has asked the court to apply the laws of Nauru to her case as she was allegedly injured in Nauru. Broadspectrum claims NSW law applies. The case is the latest claim of dangerous exposure to mould at the immigration detention centre which Australia operated on Nauru. Last year the Department of Home Affairs said there had been “no cases of anyone developing health issues following exposure to mould at the Nauru RPC”, however Comcare has confirmed it received a complaint from a former employee in 2016, and a number of other former staff have also alleged their health was affected. A microbiologist contracted to assess the problem in 2014 said the problem was “10 out of 10” and “could not be any worse” when he viewed it, and leaked emails last year cast doubt on government assurances that adequate action was being taken to combat the mould. Broadspectrum has previously said it maintained a healthy and safe workplace for its employees on Nauru. It has been contacted for comment on this current case.
177	Six of us are huddled together in Cavendish Square Gardens in central London, fighting a horde of warrior skeletons. To passersby, however, we must look like a bunch of adults pointing our smartphones at nothing while shouting about incoming monsters. This isn’t a bizarre new workplace therapy. What we’re doing is playing a beta version of Minecraft Earth, an augmented reality (AR) spinoff from the multimillion-selling block-building game – and very soon, parks all over the world will be filled with people just like us. This month, Minecraft is launching an early-access version of the game in a select few territories around the world, ahead of a global roll-out. Microsoft has yet to reveal exactly when and where, but soon thousands of fans used to playing on their console, PC or tablet, are going to be taking their creations to the streets. Built by a team at Microsoft’s Redmond campus, Minecraft Earth lets you construct models that can be viewed in real-world settings via your phone camera. You’ll be able to build a castle on your kitchen table, save it to memory, then view a lifesize version wherever you go – as long as there’s enough space for a virtual building made from 1m blocks, which can be up to 64 blocks high. The game also places collectible Minecraft blocks and objects – known as tappables – around your own neighbourhood, so while out walking, you can look at the map screen, see that there’s a treasure chest nearby, then tap on it to open it up and discover new resources to build with – perhaps a few planks of wood, some stone or a window. Like the gigantically successful Pokémon Go, however, there are also specific story events, tied to various locations, that players can discover and interact with. When Microsoft showed the game to a group of journalists in Cavendish Square Gardens, one of these Adventure tasks was marked on the Minecraft Earth maps on our phones – the moment we tapped on it, a lifesize stone building sprang up among the trees, and immediately skeleton soldiers began pouring out for us to attack with our swords and bows and arrows. When you defeat the onslaught, you get to scoop up all the treasure they leave behind. Although both the building and the skeletons are visible only as graphical objects on our phone screens, it’s weird how quickly and completely you get sucked in, forgetting that the joggers doing laps of the square can’t see the epic struggle taking place. The idea for Minecraft Earth came from an intriguing real-world project. In 2012, Mojang, the studio behind the Minecraft game, set up a charity named Block By Block, which allowed young people in developing countries to design new areas for their communities using the game. Working with the United Nations human settlements programme, these models and ideas could then be voted on and put into action, revitalising neglected or dangerous urban spaces. “We thought, what if everyone could try this?” says game director Torfi Olafsson. “We found out there was research going on in the Microsoft cognition group, which works on the Hololens unit, which would allow us to place things with precision in physical space – that’s the technology Adventures use.” Minecraft Earth employs Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing infrastructure to host and maintain the world, and Azure spatial anchors to place the persistent Adventure tasks in real-world locations. Each of these adventures is hosted on a single dedicated instance on the server, so everyone who sees an Adventure in a certain place can join in with other players and defeat enemies together. At the moment, the number of players able to join an instance is hard coded to a maximum of 40. “But it’s flexible,” says Olafsson. “It’s not a technical issue. It’s more about comfort and personal space.” The game also employs the collaborative mapping software OpenStreetMap to place tappables in the world, using a proprietary algorithm that selects suitable areas based on safety and space concerns. “Our algorithms will never choose an area that doesn’t grant enough space for you to manoeuvre within and around the adventure, and we’ll also allow players to feedback if they don’t think an adventure is well-placed,” says Olafsson. “OpenStreetMap is a fantastic resource, an incredibly detailed map of the entire world complete with tagging. You can see if a particular space is a cemetery, a public park or even a military installation.” Because the tags are generated by users, however, interesting errors can sometimes arise. “We had an issue with placing tappables in a particular neighbourhood of London,” says Olafsson. “We discovered that someone had tagged an upcoming extension of the underground as an overground train so our algorithm believed that there was a massive train line running through the area and excluded that neighbourhood completely.” He also says that some of the OpenStreetMap tags highlight locations that are unsafe – or just unsavoury. “It’ll give you information about areas that are not so nice, like really shady clubs. We use these tags to generate a blacklist of where not to place items, but it’s often very interesting – especially if you were building a sort of augmented reality Grand Theft Auto game!” Minecraft Earth has been in a prototyping phase for 18 months, and, over the last few weeks, a limited closed beta has taken place in key cities around the world – which has revealed some interesting issues. Players in Japan, for example, started to ride bullet trains so they could hoover up tappable objects much more quickly than just walking around their cities. “They were progressing too fast and it broke the system,” laughs Olafsson. “We had to install a speed limit on collecting in-game items.” The game was pirated during the beta and quickly distributed on Android devices. “Overnight we were seeing people in South Africa, in small villages in Siberia, all across Asia, a huge player base in South America,” says Olafsson. “It was shocking to wake up in the morning, look at the data and see that the game had accidentally gone global. We can’t condone piracy, but it definitely validated our use of OpenStreetMap data to generate content. A random person in Papua New Guinea was able to take their phone out and collect tappables because the algorithm had made content.” When the game enters open early access later this month, anyone in the supported territories (which Microsoft has not yet confirmed) will be able to download and play it while the team continues to iterate and improve the code. At the start, it’ll be possible to build and share only quite simple structures, although from the outset, you’ll be able to invite nearby players to collaborate on your projects. Later, Microsoft plans to define special areas in open public spaces where users will be able to showcase particularly impressive builds. Soon, perhaps, every park will have its own AR sculpture gallery. Considering the huge success of the Minecraft brand, which just reached 176 million players, as well as the continuing popularity of Pokémon Go, and the fascinated looks we drew from other people in Cavendish Square Gardens, Minecraft Earth is going to be extremely popular. It will be interesting to see how stable the experience is with hundreds of thousands of people playing, and whether the development team is able to evolve the game overtime to keep people involved. We have also yet to see exactly how Microsoft will monetise the game. It’s free to play, and to collect items, but there will be in-app purchases, perhaps providing quicker access to desirable rare blocks through payment options. Whatever the case, as a marker for the future of AR as a gaming platform, Minecraft Earth has fascinating ramifications.
178	Monday night’s distinctly underwhelming Manchester United-Arsenal “clash” has inevitably prompted a glut of nostalgia for the times when, we are told, the very fabric of the universe shook when these two sides met under the ferociously focused guidance of Alex Ferguson and Arsène Wenger. Ah Wenger. Might he still be of interest to anyone? Gazzetto dello Sport reckons Milan might be tempted, what with the Rossoneri languishing 16th in Serie A and Marco Giampaolo’s position under scrutiny. Massimiliano Allegri, Claudio Ranieri and Rudi García are among the other names being touted by the Italian daily. As for Manchester United, their current standing may be gauged by the rumour that they’re in competition with Los Angeles FC for a 33-year-old, according to Calciomercato. The 33-year-old in question, Mario Mandzukic, does admittedly have a pretty tasty pedigree but even so … Another rather more youthful United target, Jadon Sancho, could still be in reach though. The Daily Mail talks up the thoughts of Borussia Dortmund’s sporting director, Michael Zorc, who admits the club are unlikely to be able to hold on to the teenager. “No decision has been made,” Zorc told Kicker. “But you don’t have to be a prophet to know he won’t play here for another five years.” Meanwhile, Barcelona are keen on swooping for Chelsea’s Willian when the playmaker’s contract at Stamford Bridge runs out next summer. With the likes of Callum Hudson-Odoi and Christian Pulisic now in favour at the club and Willian over 30, the way could be clear for a move to the Camp Nou, and for “Willian, it was really nothing” headlines if he goes on a free. Having missed out on one Leicester defender in the summer, Manchester City are eyeing another, Caglar Soyuncu, with Fotospor in Turkey reporting that City officials want to open talks with the defender’s representatives over a move to the Etihad next summer. Wolves may have had a poor start to the season, but their players are still attracting interest. Their wideman Adoma Traoré is on Roma’s radar, says Calciomercato. And in other coaching news, Porto coach Vitor Matos is in advanced talks to join Jürgen Klopp’s coaching staff at Liverpool, according to the Liverpool Echo, and the latest name tipped to fill any Spurs vacancy that might be created by the departure of the perpetually speculated-about Mauricio Pochettino is none other than Gareth Southgate. Make of that what you will. But at least Jan Vertonghen looks closer to signing a new deal.
179	Ten years ago, Kanye West stormed the stage during the then 19-year-old Taylor Swift’s MTV VMAs acceptance speech and dropped the now-iconic “Imma let you finish” interruption: this you already know. But in the decade since, the two stars’ paths have drastically diverged: Swift into anthem-heavy pop megastardom, Kanye into footwear and God. If we treat that moment as a sort of ground zero for both their ensuing careers, could we not imagine a series of different outcomes and consequences stemming from this moment, and write them out in fun and snappy and word count-adherent hypotheticals? Well, strangely, yes. Here’s what might’ve happened. Kanye and Taylor become ‘Kanyor Swist’ The year 2009 was towards the end of The Neg-era – that Game-inspired putdown-cum-flirting tactic – and if you think about it, the most neg Neg possible is getting on stage exactly when someone’s being awarded for being good at something and telling them that actually they’re rubbish and deserve nothing. This is how we get an alt-timeline where: Kanye and Taylor become an amalgamated couple post-VMAs, Kimye never happens and Swift’s Red album never exists, because all the Vogue shoots and pre-2012 heartbreak never happened because she’s been holed up in an LA mansion for nigh-on 10 years with her lover, West. Kanye still does his blog. Taylor’s shaved her head. Shutter sunglasses are still in vogue. It’s a terrible place to live. Beyoncé never happens Hardest one to justify, this: something about Beyoncé, her sheer Beyoncéness, suggests that, on every alt-timeline, she is still Beyoncé; Beyoncé cannot escape her destiné, Beyoncé is Beyoncé in every simulation run of the planet, the only constant, more enduring than the sun. That said: say the Kanye Interruption worked as intended, and the best video award was handed out to Beyoncé on the night … how would that spin her particular ensuing career axis? Maybe she would have stuck to the Sasha Fierce alter ego, running it into the ground in an effort to further cement that MTV endorsement, zigging away from the artistic groundwork of 4 that led to the darker, stormier Drunk in Love era, and instead she just kept turning up to red-carpet parties with that Single Ladies robot glove on, glimmering in the background of paparazzi shots as other MTV VMA 2009 era celebrities – like 3OH!3, maybe, remember them? – become Beyoncé-famous instead. Imagine 3OH!3’s Lemonade. Thank the dark and mysterious ancient powers that bore you on to this earth, and not the one that had that. Kanye is subject to a rigorous intervention from his friends Fair to say Kanye’s interruption in 2009 was “very cognac-inspired” and, in a just and right world, his mates (does Kanye have mates? Someone check please) (Just thinking about how exhausting it would be to be Kanye’s mate. Have decided since the last brackets: Kanye doesn’t have mates) would sit him down in a quiet room and tell him: “Kanye, though aesthetically this is your greatest ever era, and last year’s 808s is your most underrated album, you probably need to not get up on stage during Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech and start yelling about Beyoncé; come on buddy, let’s get you to some nice cosy talking therapy.” Ultimately, the only thing different about a timeline where Kanye West addresses his demons in 2009 rather than post-Kim is we do not have the album Ye, and I think we can all agree that’s no great net loss. Taylor goes off-piste If there’s one thing Taylor Swift is known for, it’s for being an almost painfully wholesome presence in the pop world, sort of like if a BuzzFeed five-ingredient brownie recipe came to life and started doing stadium tour choreography. In the 10 years since The Kanye Incident, she has behaved with nothing but distant grace and beef-free decorum in relation to it and the ensuing remembrances (see: Kim Kardashian beef, circa 2016). But what if that’s all Kanye’s doing? Think about it: is it not possible that, 10 years ago, Kanye West handed Taylor, on stage, a sort of bulletproof moral high ground, and it’s been the handbrake on any bad behaviour ever since. She cannot possibly rebel because if she does that she will “Kanye” herself, and therefore lose. As Taylor (now) approaches the age of Kanye (then), she is nowhere near getting ungraciously drunk on Hennessy and interrupting someone else’s awards speech. Without a Kanye-shaped villain for Taylor to be the golden light in contrast to, alt-universe Taylor is currently in her OxyContin phase and flirting with a face tattoo, simply because there’s no one to prove wrong by not doing it.
180	Alice Oswald’s element is water. Her unforgettable Dart (2002) was about a river, and this electrifying new work – a single poem with a frightening undertow that reminds one a little of the mood of Coleridge’s Ancient Mariner – is an encounter with the sea. It is out of this world – and in it. It is mythical and realistic, ancient and modern and was originally commissioned to accompany a series of watercolours by William Tillyer (it has been rewritten to be a more “mobile” version). In a foreword, Oswald relates the contrasting stories from The Odyssey that inspired it. In one, Agamemnon pays a poet to spy on his wife and the poet is then banished to a stony island which allows for the seduction of the wife (Agamemnon is murdered 10 years later). In the other, Odysseus’s return, after a decade away, is luckier – his faithful wife is waiting for him. The poem exists, Oswald maintains in a foreword, in the “murky” region between these outcomes: “Its voice is wind-blown, water-damaged, as if someone set out to sing The Odyssey but was rowed to a stony island and never discovered the poem’s ending.” In Oswald’s hands, the poet on his island is at once trapped and free (is this a fair description of what it is to be a poet?). His thoughts are his escape as he surveys his Mediterranean prison. The poem is, in part, an experiment with scale. No human figure can compete with the sea. Throughout literature, poets have tried to get the upper hand with the sea but Oswald understands no single phrase can hope to possess her subject. In any contest between words and sea, the sea will win no matter how elegant, ingenious, devious (and Oswald can be all of these) the writer. She knows it will keep replenishing itself, each breaking wave potentially a new idea. Her “plough but with no harvest” idea is thrillingly accurate but then she moves on. At times, there is an alarming sense of being subsumed into sea, of time helplessly swallowed whole: and when it rains and the sand has every ounce of me marked at low tide and immediately forgotten so that my footprints far into the future go on sunkenly walking underneath me Faced with the sea’s vastness, feeling lost is common. And this thought stands alone on a double-page spread: How does it start the sea has endless beginnings And there is no stopping the sea, like a Canute of punctuation, with a question mark. Oswald is at the top of her form here – note the apparent effortlessness of the writing, the casual economy of a phrase like “breakneck cliffs”. There’s a marvellously comic exactitude at times but it isn’t allowed to undermine the prevailing sobriety. I loved the fond, accurate glimpse of “seals breathing out the sea’s bad breath/snuffle about all afternoon in sleeping bags.” And she writes beautifully about a distrait dawn and then there is the entertaining originality of this image: “and sometimes mist a kind of stupefied rain/slumps over the water like a teenager”. Occasional contemporary references (commuters, subtitles, a briefcase) are lightly judged, the seascape’s anachronistic driftwood. A prevailing sense of danger in Nobody is, if anything, heightened by the Homeric authority with which Oswald writes about fate (“that great failure of the will” – a marvellous phrase).

181	Vontaze Burfict has long been considered the NFL’s dirtiest player. And not in a misinformed, yearning for the good ol’ days, don’t-we-all-sneakily-enjoy-it way. His play is not tough but fair – it is vicious and violent. He does not look merely to tackle opponents, he often appears to be seeking to harm them too. So it’s little surprise that the 29-year-old has been suspended for the remainder of the 2019 season, after he delivered a barbaric head-to-head shot to Indianapolis Colts tight end Jack Doyle on Sunday. Burfict’s suspension will likely be reduced on appeal, as was the case with his five-game ban in 2017, which was later reduced to three. But this is more about messaging than the particulars of the ban. As the link between football and brain trauma grows, the NFL is trying to crack down on head injuries. Punishing him heavily is an easy, fan-friendly decision. But it’s also one that sends a strong message to every other locker-room: in the modern game, this type of violence not be tolerated. “There were no mitigating circumstances on this play,” Joe Runyan, the NFL’s vice president of football operations said in a letter to Burfict. “Your contact was unnecessary, flagrant and should have been avoided. For your actions, you were penalized and disqualified from the game.” The criticism escalated. “You have continued to flagrantly abuse rules designated to protect yourself and your opponents from unnecessary risk,” Runyan wrote. Never has the league office offered such a forceful rebuke of a player’s on-field conduct. The NFL edged as close to publicly labeling Burfict a pariah as a corporation can possibly do while reprimanding a unionized employee. During his time in the NFL, Burfict has missed a total of 22 games due to suspension, roughly 19% of his career. In monetary terms, he’s cost himself $4.6m in salary and has been fined nine other times, costing $411,000. That’s over $5m of his career earnings washed away by reckless play. Burfict’s troubling pattern of behavior stretches back to high school. He was the top high-school recruit at his position in the country. Recruiting site 247 Sports listed Burfict as the 11th best prospect in the country and one of the 250 best prospects in the history of high school football; he still ranks as the 39th best player to ever come out of the talent-rich state of California. But Burfict received few elite-level college scholarship offers, and he ended up at Arizona State, a third-rate program. The best of the best had heard all about Burfict’s reputation: he had serious anger issues, the story went. One by one they chose to pass. In football, passing up on a linebacker because he has anger issues is like passing on The Beatles because their music is too catchy. Linebackers are the tone setters in a brutish, collision-based sport. Find a linebacker with anger problems and you’ll see a trail of 40 coaches scuttling behind, certain in their belief that they’re the ones who can help channel that violence into controlled aggression. That wasn’t the case with Burfict. He had obvious first-round potential in the NFL draft, and teams loved his athleticism, instincts and tenacity. Yet he went undrafted. High school whispers had become facts in college, and he failed a drug test at the NFL combine. Executives and coaches across the league didn’t want to take the risk on a player with so many red flags. Those worries were realized once he signed as an undrafted free agent in Cincinnati. His years with the Bengals were marred by spells on the sidelines as suspensions and fines stacked up. The list speaks for itself: - September 2013: Fined $10,000 for striking an opponent in the groin and an additional $21,000 for a hit on a defenseless receiver in the same game. - October 2013: Fined $21,000 for spearing a receiver. - October 2014: Fined $25,000 for twisting the ankles of Panthers quarterback Cam Newton and tight end Greg Olson. - December 2015: Fined $69,000 for two unnecessary roughness penalties and diving at Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger’s knee. - January 2016: Fined $50,000 for hitting a defenseless receiver on the chin. - January 2016: Suspended three games and forfeits $500,000 in salary for a headshot on defenseless wide receiver Antonio Brown. - October 2016: Fined $75,000 for stepping on Patriots running back LeGarrette Blount. - November 2016: Fined $12,000 for giving the middle finger to Bills fans. - August 2017: Suspended three games – reduced from five – for a hit on a defenseless player. - October 2017: Fined $12,000 for kicking an opponent. - March 2018: Suspended four games for violating the NFL’s substance abuse policy. - October 2018: Fined $112,000 for multiple examples of unnecessary roughness in a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. No other player in the league has that kind of rap sheet. The Bengals finally had enough at the end of last season, and Oakland’s so-called brain-trust snapped him up, handing out a fat free-agent contract and making him a team captain. Adding Burfict to a locker-room that included Antonio Brown and Richie Incognito, men with their own troubled histories, was supposed to spur the Raiders back to their glory days, to encourage a ferocious, old-school playing style. These were not cheap-shot artists, the Raiders insisted, these were misunderstood, blue-collar football players. Burfict’s time in the NFL has been a parade of grisly hits and cowardly acts. Oakland rewarded him, promoted him as a figurehead of their Make Football Great Again movement. The NFL enabled his behavior, too: we are only a week removed from Burfict randomly punching players at the end of a play. Finally, the league has seen sense and taken Burfict off the field, for the health of its players and to safeguard the future of the sport.
182	The past few months at Säbener Strasse have resembled Coronation Street, with the goings-on at Bayern Munich reminiscent of a half‑baked and barely believable soap-opera storyline. It is, if nothing else, in keeping with the nature of the club’s FC Hollywood moniker. From the sublime – look no further than Philippe Coutinho’s sumptuous assist for Serge Gnabry on Saturday – to the ridiculous, namely the president, Uli Hoeness, recently backtracking over threatening to prevent players joining up with the national side should Manuel Neuer be dropped in favour of Marc-André ter Stegen. Never dull, it has been difficult for Bayern to mute the volume on a series of sagas. There was the very public summer pursuit of Leroy Sané, with Bayern expected to make another play for the Manchester City winger in January, and a failed effort to sign Callum Hudson-Odoi from Chelsea. The man behind the moves is the sporting director, Hasan Salihamidzic, who is out of contract next summer and at pains to convince despite pulling rabbits out of the hat with the last-minute loan signings of Coutinho and Ivan Perisic. In addition there is a changing of the guard at the top. Hoeness and the chief executive, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, have announced they will depart, though neither will truly surrender power any time soon; Hoeness will step down in November but remain on the club’s supervisory board until at least 2023 while the former Bayern captain Oliver Kahn will assume Rummenigge’s role on the first day of 2022. Caught in the middle of the impasse and infighting is the manager Niko Kovac, walking a tightrope to keep both satisfied; Rummenigge has aired his doubts and ticked off Kovac after the Croat said he was confident Sané would join the club. It seems absurd that the ground is so rocky at Bayern before they face Tottenham on Tuesday, given they are top of the Bundesliga – in which they have not lost since February – after winning a domestic double. But this is Bayern, a team who do not know any different. They are a club obsessed with success, an empire with their eyes fixed on something significantly more substantial than pipping Borussia Dortmund to the next title. Domestic success is a given by Bayern’s standards and an insipid Champions League exit to Liverpool in March – the last time they were defeated in Bavaria – rankled from top to bottom. This season they will again be expected to go deep into the competition. Bayern yearn to restore their status as a European superpower, to be elevated to the heights that Jupp Heynckes lifted them when they won the Champions League, the final of which Bayern will host in 2022, in a treble-winning season six years ago. The one constant since July 2014 has been the prolific Robert Lewandowski, who has scored 12 goals in 11 matches this season. Ten of those came in the Bundesliga, meaning he has personally outscored 10 of the 18 teams in the division. Since joining Bayern from Dortmund the Pole has scored 138 league goals in 165 games. Before the arrivals of Coutinho and Perisic, which earned Salihamidzic much-needed brownie points, the 31-year-old openly questioned the club’s transfer activity. “We need players who can make an immediate difference from the bench,” Lewandowski said after defeat by Dortmund in the German Supercup during August. He signed a new four-year contract 26 days later. “Yes, I stated my opinion,” he said. “I can win games on my own but only teams win titles.” Everything may not be rosy – it hardly ever is at Bayern – but there is plenty for Spurs to fear. Perisic and Lucas Hernández are fit enough to be part of Kovac’s travelling squad while Gnabry and Kingsley Coman continue to flourish where Arjen Robben and Franck Ribéry for so long excelled. The 18-year-old Alphonso Davies, who was born in a refugee camp in Ghana after his parents fled the second Liberian civil war, has provided further verve. But it is another summer recruit who has made supporters sit up and take notice; Der Spiegel described Coutinho as Der Tanzer, the dancer, following his exquisite pass to free Gnabry on Saturday and the Brazilian, as Lewandowski predicted, has added a touch of class. “He will definitely help us even more,” Kovac said. “He’s integrated and happy here. Whether you’re a Paderborn, Bayern or any other fan, you will have enjoyed [his performance].” Coutinho has been starting at the expense of a fans’ favourite, Thomas Müller, who has been relegated to the bench. “He has dealt with the situation really well,” Salihamidzic said. “He is total professional.” Yet the element of struggle in a 3-2 victory over the division’s bottom club last weekend is symptomatic of the uphill task facing Kovac, hampered by unhelpful headlines since taking the job last year. As Kicker pointed out, Bayern were made to worry. “That was not the manner of victory we wanted,” Salihamidzic said of a wasteful display. “In footballing terms we can play much better, clearly. We want to, we will and we must increase the level of performance. If in London we are presented with two big chances, then we must be more effective.” The challenge now, as Der Spiegel highlighted, is for Coutinho to weave his magic in a Bayern shirt against not only a team playing in the Bundesliga 2 last season but also last season’s Champions League finalists. Mats Hummels and Rafinha, players Kovac failed to convince, departed this summer but when Hoeness eventually follows there is an expectation that the manager will be exposed to greater scrutiny by Rummenigge. Hoeness has suggested a little friction fosters success but any fallout could get messy. Kovac knows, as Mauricio Pochettino can vouch, he is never too far from apparent crisis.
183	Women’s advocacy groups are pressuring the crossbench to reverse support for the latest family court inquiry, with concerns mounting the probe lacks legitimacy. Australian Women Against Violence Alliance and Fair Agenda have partnered for a campaign aimed at government leaders, their shadow counterparts and the crossbench, calling for the Hanson-led family court inquiry to be dropped. The email campaign aims to encourage MPs to push the government into implementing the recommendations put forward by the Australian Law Reform Commission, which have sat with the government since April, and address many of the procedural complaints raised about the family court process. In announcing the inquiry, to be chaired by the conservative MP Kevin Andrews and the One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the inquiry would not be “taking sides”. Hanson has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that women are routinely making up domestic violence allegations in order to win custody. But the chief executive officer of Women’s Safety NSW, Hayley Foster, said many women felt as though the inquiry had already taken a side, given Hanson’s repeated comments and leadership role, and were questioning both its legitimacy and their safety in giving testimony. “The government already has substantive evidence and recommendations before it on how to reform the family law system,” Foster said. “Not one agency concerned with the welfare of women and children experiencing family violence and abuse have come out to support this inquiry. Not one. Further, survivors of family violence have told us they do not feel safe to engage in the inquiry given the driving force behind it, and the make-up of its leadership. Without so many of their voices, how will the recommendations have legitimacy? “Survivors have come forward in substantive numbers to advise us that they will not feel comfortable providing testimony to this inquiry. And whilst some may push through – this will not mean that it is safe – and will not mean that a cross section of survivors’ experiences will be represented.” The campaign, which takes the form of emails to MPs, aims to have these concerns raised directly. Andrews recently told the ABC that while he would strive to ensure a respectful and safe environment, he would not rebuke nor condemn Hanson’s comments. “What is factual or not will be found out in this inquiry and it will be done impartially,” he said last week. Foster said the government already had enough to work with in order to reform the court, and the email campaign was designed to remind MPs of the real issues. The CEO of the Womens’ Legal Service Queensland, Angela Lynch, said while the WLSQ was not part of the email campaign, it was also advocating for the government to act on the recommendations it had in front of it. “The ALRC just conducted the most extensive review of the family law system with 60 recommendations contained in a report delivered in March 2019,” she said. “There was a previous lower house Henderson parliamentary report in 2017 with 30 to 35 recommendations that have not been acted upon. There was a 2014/15 child support inquiry. There was a 2014 Senate inquiry into domestic violence in Australia that covered off on issues of family law and domestic violence. There has been the Family Law Council Report into complex families in 2015 that made numerous recommendations [and have not yet been acted upon].” Lynch said Hanson’s views on the family law system and domestic violence had been consistent over the past two decades and the service had already been contacted by women “who told us they were scared and do not feel they can participate”. The CEO of Engender Equality in Tasmania, Alina Thomas, said any time and effort dedicated to making a submission to yet another inquiry into the family court, when the government already had recommendations it was not acting on, “takes away from delivering a frontline service which are already stretched to unprecedented levels”. In South Australia, Kathy Lilis from the Coalition of Women’s Domestic Violence Services said: “We invite our senators to demonstrate that they do indeed value the lives and safety of women and their children, by listening to the experts in women’s safety, including women with lived experience of violence, and to rethink this parliamentary inquiry.” Lilis said senators should invest in implementing the changes that have already been identified to improve the safety of those at risk in the family law system, rather than support a new inquiry. “We implore them to listen to survivors who have risked so much to tell them that the current system is destroying lives, and to believe them when they say that an additional inquiry, along the lines of that which is currently proposed, will create further damage.”
184	Britain’s accounting watchdog has begun an investigation into EY’s audit of Thomas Cook’s accounts, just over a week after the world’s oldest travel firm collapsed. The Financial Reporting Council said its enforcement division was investigating EY’s audit of the financial statements of Thomas Cook for the year to 30 September 2018. “The FRC will keep under close review both the scope of this investigation and the question of whether to open any other investigation in relation to Thomas Cook, liaising with other relevant regulators to the fullest extent permissible,” it said. EY took over from PwC as Thomas Cook’s auditors in 2017. Both are among the UK’s big four accountancy firms. Five months before its collapse, Thomas Cook reported a £1.5bn first-half loss in May and issued its third profit warning in less than a year. In that set of accounts, EY warned there was “significant doubt” whether Thomas Cook could continue as a going concern. On Monday, the FRC said it had issued a revised going concern standard following a spate of corporate failures in which auditors failed to flag up concerns about the company’s viability. The collapsed tour operator had three different finance chiefs in two years as its financial problems deepened, and has faced questions about its accounting methods. Sten Daugaard became Thomas Cook’s chief financial officer in December 2018 after Bill Scott quit after less than a year in the job following a profit warning. Scott had replaced Michael Healy in January 2018 when Healy stepped down after five years in the job. Daugaard changed the way Thomas Cook reported its accounts to include items that had been treated as exceptional costs for several years, including when paying directors and meeting banking covenants. He told analysts in November that when he looked at the books “one thing that I could immediately observe was the size of the exceptionals”. The FRC aims to complete investigations within two years. If it finds evidence of wrongdoing, it could take EY to a tribunal, assuming there is no settlement. The tribunal would decide on the guilt of the firm and any individuals, and impose penalties if appropriate. They can include fines, as well as non-financial penalties such as a greater oversight of the firm and banning individuals from working.
185	An independent commission should set the rate of Newstart to end the politicisation of welfare payment rates in Australia, according to a broad group of social service organisations, health groups and charities. As the Coalition ducks calls to lift the payment by $75 a week, more than a dozen organisations told a Senate inquiry into Newstart that the government should be forced to confront expert advice on the historically low rates of income support. Calling for an increase to the payment in their submission, groups including Uniting Communities, the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association and the Consumers Health Forum said a social security commission should help set the rate of welfare payments including Newstart to avoid a repeat of the 25-year “freeze” of the unemployment payment. The commission would determine an acceptable standing of living for people on Newstart and then determine rates of payment and indexation, the groups said in separate submissions. Some organisations said the commission should provide advice to the government, while others called for an authority like the Fair Work Commission that would set welfare payment rates free from from political interference. The current system, which saw the government provide a small increase to the age pension through changes to deeming rates this year, was described by one advocate for an independent commission, the Queensland Council of Social Service, as “mostly a political process”. Another, Anglicare, told the inquiry: “Twenty years of inaction is more than enough to show that the existing system of relying on governments to regularly review social security payments and ensure that they keep pace with the cost of living has failed”. Newstart, which is paid to about 700,000 people each fortnight, is currently $279.50 for a single person. It has been effectively frozen since the mid-1990s after it was benchmarked to the consumer price index by the Howard government. At the same time, the Coalition tied pensions to wages, a decision that has seen the gap between the two payments widen significantly over time. Most welfare payments increase against these measures twice a year, although the former Labor government gave the age pension a one-off real terms increase in 2009 following a review. Labor proposed a similar inquiry into Newstart before the last election, but has since said it supports an increase to the payment without a review. Good Shepherd Australia, a women’s advocacy organisation, said in its submission that parliament should consider adopting the model used in Scotland, where an independent authority monitors the government’s performance against a social security charter. The former independent MP Cathy McGowan last year produced a bill for a social security commission after she backed calls from the Australian Council of Social Service. Submissions also addressed the impact of the low payment on Newstart recipients. In one submission, the Australian Association of Social Workers said that its members working in oncology wards had reported instances of people “going without medication and refusing treatment because they cannot afford transport to the clinic”. The Consumers Health Forum, meanwhile, said Newstart recipients had reported choosing between tampons and food and saving money by avoiding taking medication, particularly for mental health conditions. Another submission from the charity Uniting Communities said that clients in communities where bulk billing clinics were not available would avoid going to the doctors to get their scripts filled. Noting that people over 55 were now the largest cohort of people on Newstart, Good Shepherd also said its financial counsellors had seen an “an alarming increase in older people who are seeking help”. The Senate inquiry into the rate of Newstart and related payments such as youth allowance was established as part of a push from Labor, the Greens and members of the crossbench to pressure the Morrison government into lifting the rate. It will hold public hearings next week. The Australian Council of Social Service calls for a $75 a week increase, which would cost the budget about $3.3bn a year. Scott Morrison has repeatedly said he has no plans to raise the rate of the payment, despite calls from some Coalition backbenchers.
186	Thanks for joining us, we are going to leave our live coverage here. Just to recap the main points: The Reserve Bank has made its third reduction in the cash rate in five months. It takes the benchmark borrowing rate in Australia to yet another record low of 0.75%. Governor Philip Lowe said the economy was at a turning point but the prospect of slower jobs growth and low inflation convinced him of the need to act; The Aussie dollar dipped 0.4% to US67.22c; Some economists were predicting further rate cuts this year; Comparison website Mozo said it will put more pressure on the big banks to pass on the cut to mortgage holders; Labor’s Jim Chalmers has criticised the Coalition’s economic management, as did the Greens The government has tried to put a positive spin on the rate cut with Josh Frydenberg saying that the RBA has pointed to “a gentle turning point in the domestic economy” and also urged the banks to pass on the rate cut There has been radio silence from the big four banks. Usually by about this time of the day after a rate cut, one of the big players would have broken ranks to announce their new rates. The banks are under enormous political pressure to pass on the full 25 basis points, but analysts have predicted Westpac, NAB and Australia’s biggest bank, the Commonwealth, will keep some of it for themselves. The cut comes despite a 0.9% jump in house prices in September The share market has enjoyed its best day in nearly a month with the S&amp;P/ASX200 index up 54.5 points, or 0.81%, to 6,742.8 points A quick update on the Australian share market and the dollar via our friends at Australian Associated Press: The Australian share market has enjoyed its best day in nearly a month following the Reserve Bank’s decision to cut the cash rate for a third time this year. The S&amp;P/ASX200 index on Tuesday finished up 54.5 points, or 0.81 per cent, to 6,742.8 points, while the broader All Ordinaries rose 52.4 points, or 0.77 per cent, to 6,853 points CMC Markets chief market strategist Michael McCarthy said that Tuesday’s session had a lacklustre start but then buyers moved off the sidelines once the RBA cut rates mid-afternoon, sending the ASX up 50 points. “A very strong performance, largely built around that rate cut,” he said. Volumes were 10 per cent above average and the market finished at its highs of the day, indicating there could be more gains to come on Wednesday, Mr McCarthy said. The ASX200 is only 2% off the record all-time highs it set in late July. The Aussie dollar meanwhile dipped to a four-week low against its US counterpart, and was close to a 10-and-a-half year low. It was buying 67.02 US cents, from 67.54 US cents on Monday. Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive, James Pearson, has urged lenders to pass on the rate cut to “ensure the greatest benefit is gained” by households. He said: “Although we are still to see the full impact of the earlier reductions in the cash rate and personal tax cuts, we believe the timing is right to boost parts of the economy that continue to struggle. “With slowing economic growth and lower consumer confidence, small businesses have been doing it tough over the past year. This has particularly affected discretionary spending in small retail businesses, including cafes and restaurants.” “Weakness in the housing sector has also been a significant drag on the economy over the past year, which has flowed through to consumer confidence and household spending.” “However, there are signs the housing sector has turned the corner recently, with a modest improvement in Sydney and Melbourne house prices. The lower interest rates will help the housing sector to rebuild momentum.” Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has responded to the rate cut by accentuating the positive - that the RBA has pointed to “a gentle turning point in the domestic economy”. He said the RBA had noticed the “positive benefits that have been gained by the economy from the interest rate cuts, from the tax cuts, from extra spending on infrastructure from the stabilisation of the housing market and for the uptick in mining investment”. Frydenberg flew right past all the RBA comments on low wages growth, suggesting that the “significant challenges” the economy faces are “internationally with the global trade tensions between China and the US but they are also domestically, particularly with the punishing impact of the drought and floods”. And of course no rate cut announcement would be complete without putting the hard word on lenders to pass it on: It is the government’s expectation that the banks will pass on this 25 basis point rate cut in full. What this means for an Australian family with a mortgage of $400,000 is $720 less a year in interest payments. That’s a significant benefit to an Australian family. It is completely reckless for the Labor Party to be talking down the Australian economy.” Asked why the government isn’t spending more money to stimulate the economy and how many rate cuts it will take before it will get involved, Frydenberg continued to point to existing policies including the 10-year $100bn infrastructure package. He even claimed that “the Labor Party opposed our tax cuts which are now delivering billions of dollars into the pockets of hard-working Australians” despite Labor voting for the tax cuts in the parliament. Asked if the government is concerned the cuts will lead to house price rises, Frydenberg responded: We have welcomed the stabilisation in the housing market and this is important because it plays into confidence for households and household consumption is around 60% of GDP. We also know that for most Australians owning their own home is not only their dream, it is their biggest asset. They want to see its value appreciate over time, which has been the history in our country. In terms of the clearance rates, they have gone up and in terms of prices they are now starting to go up. So the interest rate cuts have contributed to a stabilisation in the housing market which we welcome.” Whoah. The Reserve Bank’s race to the bottom continued today with its third reduction in the cash rate in five months. It takes the benchmark borrowing rate in Australia to yet another record low of 0.75%. it’s more good news for borrowers and house prices. But bad news for savers and – if you think that the sight of a central bank slashing rates to a record low is something to worry about – it’s also bad news for the economy because it surely means the RBA expects things to get worse.. Anyway, here are the main points: The RBA has cut the cash rate by 0.25% to a record low of 0.75%. It’s the third cut this year ; Governor Philip Lowe said the economy was at a turning point but the prospect of slower jobs growth and low inflation convinced him of the need to act; The Aussie dollar dipped 0.4% to US67.22c; Some economists were predicting further rate cuts this year; Comparison website Mozo said it will put more pressure on the big banks to pass on the cut to mortgage holders; Labor’s Jim Chalmers has criticised the Coalition’s economic management, as did the Greens The cut comes despite a 0.9% jump in house prices in September Labor’s shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers put the cut on the coalition government’s lack of action to stimulate the economy. “If the Liberals were doing a good job managing the economy the RBA wouldn’t have needed to cut interest rates to another new record low today,” Chalmers tweeted. BIS Oxford Economics are getting ahead of the curve, looking for the next big thing. They say we shouldn’t expect a rate RISE until 2021. Chief economist Sarah Hunter says the board highlighted “downside risks to the global economic outlook, and the persistent headwinds facing the domestic economy”. It expected jobs growth to “slow significantly over the near term as the economy absorbs the residential construction downturn and sluggish retail environment”. The bank is also projecting inflation to remain around 2% through to 2021, “which suggests there will not be a rate rise until the end of 2021 at the earliest”. Savers, read it and weep ... Capital Economics says the rate cut today was widely expected but says that the RBA’s prediction of a slowdown in jobs growth (the aforementioned construction slump is a key factor here) points to another cut “by the end of the year”. The bank argued that forward-looking indicators of labour demand point to a slowdown in employment growth. Indeed, employment surveys suggest that jobs growth will slow from around 2.5% now to around 2.0% around the turn of the year. It’s possible that the recent surge in the participation rate fizzles out at the same time, but we consider it more likely that unemployment will climb a bit further. Our forecast is that the unemployment rate will reach a peak at 5.5% in the first half of that year. Meanwhile, we think that global growth won’t accelerate anytime soon. Business confidence will therefore remain muted and investment will probably keep falling. We reiterate our forecast that rates will fall to 0.5% before the end of the year. The comparison site Mozo.com says the rate cut could start a mortgage rate war after the online lenders Athena and Homestar said they would pass on the 0.25% cut to their customers in full. Such a move would put pressure on the big four banks to cut rates and give some more relief to Australia’s debt burdened households. Here’s Mozo director Kirsty Lamont: Online lenders are reacting to today’s RBA cut with lightning speed. They’re turning the screws on the big banks knowing the banks are in an unwinnable position, with the unenviable choice of having to either pass through today’s cut in full to mortgage customers and take a hit to their net profit margins, or hold back part of the cut and risk losing even more borrowers to their cheaper rivals. The Greens say that the RBA has been railroaded into cutting rates because the government has refused to do its bit for the economy by increasing spending. This lack of so-called fiscal stimulus – as opposed to monetary stimulus from the RBA – has irritated senator Peter Whish-Wilson: Without government borrowing to fund an increase in infrastructure spending, record low interest rates are re-inflating the housing market and going towards other unproductive and speculative investments. This is diluting the effectiveness of monetary policy and is railroading the RBA towards QE. Instead of being concerned about this trend, the treasurer actually seems to be cheering it along. Just last week, Josh Frydenberg was spruiking the virtue of further increases in house prices, and encouraged banks to push the limits of responsible lending barely eight months since Commissioner Hayne handed down his report.” The dollar spiked to US67.57c on the news of the RBA cut but has fallen back again in the last few minutes to US67.29c as traders digest the statement from Philip Lowe. In it he clearly lays out the prospect of more cuts – or even perhaps some less conventional policy such as money-printing or quantitative easing. Here’s what the conclusion of the statement says (my emphasis in bold): It is reasonable to expect that an extended period of low interest rates will be required in Australia to reach full employment and achieve the inflation target. The board will continue to monitor developments, including in the labour market, and is prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy, full employment and the achievement of the inflation target over time. Here’s some reaction to the news: Philip Lowe says in his statement that: the bank acted to boost jobs and incomes lower rates overseas have played a factor and more monetary easing – ie more cuts – are still on the table growth is weaker than expected but has reached a “gentle turning point” household spending still weak and wage growth subdued further signs of turnaround in housing market This is governor Philip Lowe’s full statement after his board cut rates to yet another record low. It’s the third cut this year and reflects the bank’s concern that growth is still too sluggish to reduce unemployment and boost inflation. The RBA has cut rates to 0.75% Seconds to go ... Just a few minutes to go before we get the proverbial puff of white smoke from above Martin Place. But in the meantime some interesting commentary from the banking team at UBS. They have taken a fairly bearish view of Australia’s big banks in the last couple of years and they are continuing their sceptical outlook. They say that although the housing credit downturn may be bottoming out, it’s still hard yards ahead for the banks because low interest rates = low profits. The UBS team says that bank shares – the bedrock of all our super accounts – look too high: While the pick-up in lending is positive, bank fundamentals are increasingly challenged with ultra-low interest rates... With ongoing revenue pressure, we expect further dividend cuts and banks to rebase target [return of equity] to more realistic levels for an ultra-low rate environment. Following the re-rating, banks look expensive on 15.6x and 1.7x book with a falling EPS profile over the medium term. Across the ditch, a plunge in business confidence is continuing to hurt the New Zealand dollar. It has fallen below US62.49c, the lowest since September 2015. The RBNZ caught markets off guard in August when it cut rates by 0.5% to 1%. There were also encouraging numbers today from the Australian Industry Group (AiGroup) manufacturing index, which rose from 53.1 points to 54.7 points in September. However, another closely watched snapshot of the economy, the CBA/IHS Markit manufacturing purchasing managers’ index, fell from 50.9 points to 50.3 points. Any reading over 50 indicates expansion so the numbers tend to suggest the economy is travelling OK. Not every Liberal in Canberra is hoping for a rate cut. My colleague Paul Karp has this: Liberal MP Tim Wilson, the chair of the House of Representatives economics committee, has told Guardian Australia that he hopes the RBA leaves interest rates on hold to give savers a break. My hope is that the RBA leaves interest rates alone. There’s not sufficient evidence that there’s pass through from the last two rate cuts to stimulate the economy but there is evidence it is fuelling house price rises and ultimately higher debt. Wilson has challenged the RBA to justify the effectiveness of monetary policy prompting a lengthy response from the central bank arguing - yes - rate cuts still work. The RBA said: In aggregate, Australian households benefit from the effect of lower interest rates. While the income of households with deposits is lower than if rates had not been reduced, the household sector as a whole has around twice as much debt as deposits. The CoreLogic house price index was not the only piece of data released today. On the other side of the ledger, the number of housing approvals fell again in August, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics this morning. Forecasters said the numbers showed that the construction downturn is not yet over. Approvals were down 1.1% in August and private house approvals dropped by 2.4%. Approvals are now at their lowest level since January 2013 and 44% below their November 2017 peak. Approvals dipped in every state and territory, with ACT (27.7%), the Northern Territory (8.7%) and NSW (5.4%) the hardest hit, in trend terms. Economists at JP Morgan said the figures would be a “meaningful drag” on economic growth going forward. The approvals are “terrible news for construction” and point to a cut by the RBA in half an hour ... So more on the mega data dump this morning. The most eye-catching was the 0.9% rise in the average national house price for September, largely driven by a strong rebound in the Sydney and Melbourne markets. Values in the two biggest cities were up 1.7% over the month, according to the CoreLogic September home value index. Prices have been boosted by increased investor activity amid lower rates and an easing of lending requirements by the banks since the May election. Australia’s two largest cities have recorded a rapid bounce-back in home values over the past two months, with Sydney up a cumulative 3.3% and Melbourne up 3.2% in August and September. Brisbane and Canberra were the only other capital cities to record a rise in dwelling values over the month, rising 0.1% and 1.0% respectively. Values held in Adelaide but fell 0.4% in Hobart and continued their long run of losses in Perth (down 0.8%) and Darwin (down 0.2%). Combined regional dwelling prices increased by 0.1 per cent, compared to a 1.1 per cent rise for combined capital city prices. The question will still be whether to take the plunge or not. You can read more on that here The ASX200 has risen ahead of today’s rates decision. The benchmark index is up 17.30 points this lunchtime to 6,705.60, a rise of 0.26%. The Aussie dollar is under more pressure though. It’s down 0.16% to US67.4c. Good afternoon and welcome to the live blog on the Reserve Bank’s interest rate decision. The bank’s board members are tipped by a majority of economists to cut the cash rate by 25 basis points to 0.75% this afternoon. The chief factors driving the move are continued sluggish economic growth and the need for the RBA to meet its inflation rate of between 2-3%. Any cut will be welcomed in Canberra where Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have gamed the economy by opting for tax cuts and budget surplus rather than the large increase in government spending that some say would be better for the country than another rate cut. However, a rate cut may not be completely cut and dried, especially after the latest monthly house price figures from CoreLogic today showed their biggest rise for more than two years. The numbers suggest that the property downturn could be over and that further rate cuts – the cash rate is already at an all-time low – could inflate another housing bubble. On the other side of the ledger, building approvals fell again in August, indicating that the construction downturn still has some way to run. More on those figures later but on with the blog ...
187	Victims of the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti, which killed at least 10,000 people and infected hundreds of thousands more, are petitioning the US supreme court on Tuesday to hold the UN accountable for having brought the disease to the stricken country. The nine supreme court justices will meet in conference to discuss whether to hear Laventure v UN as one of their cases of the new term. The petition goes to the heart of the question: should the world body be answerable in domestic courts for the harm it causes people it is there to serve? The UN has admitted that cholera was introduced to Haiti by peacekeepers in 2010 after about 1,000 troops were redeployed from Nepal to help in emergency work following a devastating earthquake. Basic health measures that could have been taken to prevent the transfer of the disease at the cost to the UN of only $2,000 were not taken, and instead raw sewage from the peackekeepers’ camps was dumped directly into rivers from which thousands of Haitians routinely drew water for cooking and drinking. A leaked report carried out by the UN itself a month after the initial outbreak of cholera found serious sanitation flaws in the Haiti peacekeeping mission. Yet for six years the world body continued to deny it had anything to do with the health catastrophe. Crucially, the UN continues to reject any requests for compensation from the hundreds of thousands of Haitian victims. It insists that it has total immunity from such claims relating to the harmful impact caused by its staff carrying out routine business. Now the US supreme court is being asked to consider the issue, and specifically whether the UN should be liable for the cholera disaster through domestic American courts. The issue is highly sensitive within the US, given that the UN is headquartered in New York where the annual general assembly session has just been held, and given the large number of Haitians who live in America. The latest official figures, widely assumed to be understatements, put the number of dead in Haiti from cholera at 9,792 with a total of 819,995 suspected cases. Three thousand American and Haitian citizens harmed by the cholera epidemic are listed in the complaint before the supreme court. The lead plaintiff, Marie Laventure, is a nurse living in Atlanta. She has three siblings also in the US, and eight siblings still in Haiti. Laventure’s father and stepmother died of cholera in 2012, leaving the siblings under the care of the elder children struggling to fend for themselves. “Like so many others – in Haiti and the US as well – my family has suffered greatly because of the UN’s actions,” Laventure told the Guardian. “Justice demands UN accountability. That is why we are asking the US supreme court to uphold the promise the UN made when it put aside immunity and agreed to be liable in cases like ours.” The New York-based lawyer representing the victims, James Haggerty, pointed to precedent set in 1996 when the UN had accepted liability for the damage done by its peacekeepers in the regular performance of their duties. Exceptions were made such as the fallout of combat and actions required as part of operational necessity, but the principle of accountability was acknowledged. Despite such precedent, the UN continues to put its efforts into health programs to fight the Haitian epidemic while denying any liability to the victims. “As it stands now, the UN can walk away from even those agreements it has made that it is liable. If words are to have any meaning, they should apply to the UN too,” Haggerty said. The attorney added that immunity enabled a culture within the UN in which mishaps were more likely to happen. “The cholera epidemic happened because the UN felt it was never going to be liable and therefore failed to take basic steps to prevent it. Any time an organization feels it can never be held accountable, that’s when mistakes happen, corners are cut and things are done that are negligent or worse.”
188	Critics call it inhumane. Even its supporters talk of its colossal delays and waste. Now, universal credit has been given another blow as Labour announced the system would be scrapped under a Jeremy Corbyn government. Labour has not yet disclosed what this would fully entail – rather than a total scrap, it appears the basic structure would remain. But a £3bn package of emergency reforms seems enough to make the new model unrecognisable: from removing the tax-credit “rape clause” (whereby women have to show their third or subsequent child was conceived as a result of rape to be exempt from the two-child limit on receiving the credit), to introducing interim payments to cushion people from the debt-creating five-week wait. That the party has committed to scrap the system is a hugely significant step. The underfunding of Britain’s safety net has now gone beyond critical levels. Over the past decade, multibillion-pound cuts, combined with a toxic anti-welfare narrative, has upended the meaning of social security. Humiliation has replaced help, punishment put in place of compassion. Universal credit has in many ways come to define the cruel incompetence of the austerity era, in which social security – rather than providing a safety net for people in time of need – actively pushes them into crisis. Just this month, research by Unite showed claimants were routinely going hungry – more than four in 10 have been forced to use a food bank – and are left unable to pay bills. Some were even suicidal. The government’s pledge that this was all worth it, as the system would “make work pay”, has looked ever more hollow as workers graft full time only to find themselves at risk of homelessness, and poverty and inequality spreads. And yet despite the vast problems that plague universal credit, campaigners and experts have been torn over how best to respond now it has already partly rolled out, costing billions of pounds of public money. Last year, the National Audit Office claimed “there is no practical alternative” to continuing with it, while the Joseph Rowntree Foundation cautioned against causing further upheaval for those who depend on benefits to get by. But policymaking can be about the heart, as well as the head. I’ve spoken to people on universal credit for years, many of them battling ill health while scraping together their last pound for a hot meal. Amid it all, they often tell me one hope: that Corbyn would commit to ending the system. For the families pushed into debt, it’s acknowledgement from politicians that their pain matters. Universal credit is often talked of in terms of design flaws but this is inaccurate. “Flaws” suggest an error, a shortcoming, that was made by mistake. In fact, leaving people without money for longer than a month was deliberately engineered to model a pay packet (despite the fact that in a modern economy, many people are not paid this way and claimants often have no savings to fall back on). Similarly, it was a political choice to launch what at any time would be a deeply complex system while cutting billions from the welfare budget. That a terminally ill man had to take the government to court after being pushed into hardship by being transferred to universal credit gives an insight into how low its architects sunk. For even more significance, though, look beyond the headlines and to the detail. As well as scrapping universal credit, Labour have also pledged to end the two-child limit – which Labour says could lift 300,000 children from poverty – the punitive benefit sanctions scheme and the benefit cap, while entirely replacing the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) with the newly named Department for Social Security. The policies that have come out of the DWP in recent years have been rotten, but it is the culture that has created the stench: one that has demonised those who need help from the state, and done all it can to shirk its duties to them. Whether it is universal credit or the benefit cap, Labour’s platform marks a chance to depart from the George Osborne era of blaming “scroungers” – to say policies that push people into destitution based on little more than class prejudice have no place in social security, and to shift the narrative that so-called “welfare waste” actually saves the NHS, child social care, and housing bills. There has rarely been a more crucial time to rebuild a social security system that the public can have faith in – one that provides a comprehensive safety net that lifts people out of poverty and, in turn, creates a healthier society. Social security should not mean suffering. It is a reflection of how benefit claimants have been treated in recent years that such a message could ever be contentious. • This article was amended on 2 October 2019 to more accurately describe one of Labour’s pledges – to end the punitive benefit sanctions scheme. • Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist
189	﻿The quest for a fabled treasure trove containing jewels, gold and original Incan artefacts – and believed to have been buried on a South Pacific island by 18th century Spanish pirates – could be about to reach its dramatic conclusion. But the decision to allow a Dutch American textiles magnate to use heavy machinery to dig on Chile’s sparsely populated Juan Fernández Islands has sparked an outraged response from archaeologists and environmentalists. “The motive is profit, not archaeological interest,” said Alejandra Vidal, the representative of the Chilean College of Archaeologists on the National Monuments Council. “Given the equipment that will be used, there’s a very real risk of artefacts being lost or damaged in the process.” Bernard Keiser, who has been searching for the hoard for more than two decades, has been granted permission to excavate a 400 sq metre plot near Puerto Inglés on Robinson Crusoe Island, one of the three main volcanic islets that make up the Juan Fernández Archipelago 600 miles off the Chilean coast. Chile’s National Forestry Corporation’s (Conaf) decision came even though the islands are protected by both national and international law, said Valentina Durán, the director of the Environmental Law Centre at the University of Chile’s law faculty. “The area given over for the dig is doubly safeguarded, as it lies within the Juan Fernández national park and was also designated a Unesco biosphere reserve in 1977,” she said. “Regulations are particularly stringent for foreigners to dig on sovereign Chilean soil in sites considered archaeological monuments ... What is clear from this case is that we need better protection, institutions and clearer laws for protected areas,” said Durán. Adding to the controversy, Pablo Mira, the regional director of Conaf for Valparaíso – under whose jurisdiction the islands fall – was abruptly dismissed from his post in September. Mira had been a vocal opponent of the treasure hunt, but Chilean authorities have insisted that his dismissal was unrelated to the excavation permit. Keiser, who could not be reached for comment, used scanning equipment to pinpoint a possible location after an exhaustive and expensive search that has thus far been conducted manually due to the area’s conservation status. He now reportedly believes that the treasure is hidden in a synthetic tunnel beneath a thick slab of rock. José Manuel Rebolledo, the executive director of Conaf, has said that the necessary evaluations were made in order to guarantee that the dig will not affect the national park in any way. If successful, Keiser’s search could put to rest the 300-year-old mystery surrounding the exact nature of the riches accrued by the Spanish sailor Juan Esteban Ubilla. According to historical record, Ubilla accumulated the hoard – said to be worth $10bn – on his travels along South America’s Pacific coast in the early 18th century. He buried it in the remote Juan Fernández Islands when his ship was intercepted by the British navy admiral Lord Anson in 1714. The haul is rumoured to contain original gold statues from Peru – including a necklace belonging to the wife of the last Inca emperor, Atahualpa – as well as 800 barrels of gold and silver coins. A crew sent to recover the treasure in 1761 under the command of the British navigator Cornelius Webb found the hoard and loaded it aboard their ship. However, a mast split in bad weather as they were leaving the island and Webb was forced to turn back and rebury the hoard. Webb then drew two treasure maps and wrote out coded instructions, one of which he sent back to England. Keiser acquired the second copy in 1998 from the family of the Chilean politician Luis Cousiño. In 1704, the Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk was marooned in the archipelago for four years, inspiring Daniel Defoe’s novel Robinson Crusoe – after which one of the islands was renamed in 1966 in a bid to increase tourism.
190	An effort in recent months by Donald Trump to rewrite the history of the 2016 US presidential election and set up a 2020 re-election victory was more geographically sprawling and reliant on the day-to-day participation of top cabinet members than previously reported, it emerged on Monday. William Barr, the attorney general, and Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, collectively participated in contacts between Trump and leaders of at least four foreign countries, according to multiple reports. Those contacts were variously aimed at producing stories that could damage Joe Biden, Trump’s potential 2020 opponent, or at producing stories that could undermine the US intelligence community’s assessment from 2017 of Russian election tampering in the last election, the reports said. An impeachment inquiry launched last week in the House of Representatives was sparked by known Trump administration contacts with one country: Ukraine. But the picture of Trump’s outreach to additional potential foreign partners, and the scope of involvement of top government officials in the effort, was quickly changing. Barr and Pompeo – whose vast portfolios nominally run from administering criminal justice in the United States to securing international alliances and combating threats abroad – have separately tried to distance themselves from the avalanching revelation that Trump’s conduct of the matters of state has apparently, in significant proportion, been devoted to the pursuit of the president’s personal bugbears and ambitions. Barr was previously reported to be “surprised and angry” to find his name mentioned in a summary of a call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, while Pompeo, when asked what he knew about that phone call, replied that he had not seen a copy of the whistleblower document that flagged it: “I haven’t seen the complaint,” he told ABC News. In fact, Pompeo reportedly took part in the call, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing a senior state department official. For his part, Barr flew to Italy and to London to ask for help in “investigating” the roots of the Russia investigation, the Washington Post reported. Trump also asked the Australian prime minister Scott Morrison for help, and Morrison agreed to assist, something confirmed by the Australian government. “It should trouble all of us that the attorney general is flying overseas and spending his time focused on discrediting the origins of the Mueller probe instead of combating crime here in the US,” tweeted the former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti. “His personal involvement reinforces the view that he does Trump’s bidding.” “Pretty clear that Barr is working feverishly [with] Trump to produce some kind of anti-Mueller report,” tweeted the MSNBC host Chris Hayes. The justice department defied that characterization, issuing a statement on Monday that described Barr’s work as business-as-usual to support the US attorney John Durham’s investigation of the FBI’s former inquiry into Russian election tampering. The DoJ opened the counter-investigation following Trump’s repeated claims that his campaign, which had serial secret contacts with Russian operatives, had been unfairly targeted for scrutiny. “At attorney general Barr’s request, the president has contacted other countries to ask them to introduce the attorney general and Mr Durham to appropriate officials,” the spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said. Foreign officials could have information useful to Durham because the investigation of Trump’s campaign began with a tip to the FBI from an Australian diplomat that a Trump aide had drunkenly told him about a Russian offer of “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. But it was very unusual for the attorney general, much less the president, to be personally involved at such lengths in an internal investigation, even where foreign contacts are required, former federal prosecutors said. “In a real investigation, all that is needed is a request from a line prosecutor to the foreign country, made through the [justice department] Office of International Affairs, and pursuant to the terms of a mutual legal assistance treaty,” tweeted Harry Sandick, a former prosecutor in the southern district of New York. “No calls from the president are involved.” Trump’s exertions to rewrite the history of the 2016 election and win re-election next year are the focus on an impeachment inquiry, which he appears to want to beat by exploiting the powers of his office to tar his political opponents as corrupt. After the inquiry was announced last week, the Trump administration intensified an investigation of communications between career public servants and Clinton, who found scandal by setting up a private server to host her correspondence as secretary of state. Pompeo oversees the internal state department investigation. But he has refused questions about it. “I tried to ask [Pompeo] today why he is targeting veteran diplomats for routine emails when they had nothing to do with that private server,” the NBC News anchor Andrea Mitchell tweeted Monday. “He turned his back and walked away.” When a summary appeared last week of the July phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, the scope of involvement by the Trump administration appeared at first to be limited. Trump had mostly used his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to pursue his project, it seemed. But that picture has quickly changed. The release of a whistleblower report Thursday suggested an active role by Barr, and said that a dozen US officials had listened to the Trump-Ukraine phone call, and that summaries of the call had been distributed more widely – raising the question of what proportion of Trump administration energies in recent months have been devoted to Trump’s pet projects. “The America First crowd is jeopardizing our national security,” tweeted Barack Obama’s former speechwriter Jon Favreau, “by pressuring foreign governments to help them discredit our intelligence officials and rig our elections.”
191	Imagine having children waiting at home for a meal you can’t provide, or feeling the sharp pangs of hunger because you didn’t get to eat today. This is the reality for more than 4 million Australians every year. In 2018, an alarming 18% of the population experienced a time when they ran out of food and could not afford to buy more. Food insecurity is a global issue. In 2017, an estimated 821 million people worldwide were undernourished, and poor nutrition causes nearly half of deaths in children under five every year. In Australia, one in five children do not know where their next meal is coming from. Globally, we produce enough to feed every single person on the planet and eradicate hunger. But according to food relief charity Foodbank, about half of charities report the number of people seeking food relief is increasing. While so many people are going without, the Australian government estimates that more than 3 million tonnes of our food ends up in landfill every year. The cost is high, and it’s not only financial. Almost 60% of Australians living with food insecurity spend more than 20% of their household income on food - more than twice as much proportionally as the average household. More than half are forced to skip a meal weekly, while one in four go an entire day without eating at least once a week. The long-term effects are profound: hungry children are affected day to day, but they are also more likely to develop serious health concerns in the 10-15 years following. Adults feel tired, find it harder to concentrate and say their mental health suffers. In Australia, one in five children do not know where their next meal is coming from. Foodbank’s CEO, Brianna Casey, says people are surprised to learn how many Australians are affected. “At the moment, we’re assisting 710,000 people every month,” she says. “Fifty per cent of the people we’re supporting are employed in some way. A lot of Australians would be shocked to know people living in their own street, in their own community, have had a point in the past 12 months when they simply didn’t know where their next meal was going to come from.” Foodbank is Australia’s largest food relief organisation, having provided food for more than 67 million meals across the country in 2018. One of its initiatives is the national milk program, which supplies fresh milk to frontline charity partners and school breakfast programs. It brings together dairy farmers, logistics companies and even packaging makers in every state and territory, every week of the year. Together, program partners Fonterra, Parmalat, Lion Dairy &amp; Drinks and Saputo donate a million litres of milk every year. That’s 4 million serves (or glasses of milk), which goes a significant way to helping people meet the recommended daily dairy intake. When food security is at risk, it’s even more important to make every meal count. Milk is nutrient-rich: it is a source of calcium, contains protein for muscle strength, and, as part of a healthy diet, has even been found to help prevent heart disease. And it is versatile enough to be a drink on its own, the ticket to a delicious breakfast or the enriching base of a hearty dinner. Fonterra’s managing director, René Dedoncker, says milk is an essential staple and an important source of vitamins and minerals. “We know that 8 out of 10 Australians don’t consume the recommended amount of dairy, but many families faced with food insecurity go without it,” he says. “Our partnership with Foodbank represents a small donation from us, but it means Foodbank have a predictable supply of fresh milk for families in need.” Foodbank uses this milk, along with hundreds of other food and grocery products, to support 2,600 frontline charities, including women’s domestic violence shelters, schools and asylum-seeker refuge centres in cities and regional and rural areas. They’re not just fighting hunger; the impacts reach much further. Foodbank sources and rescues more than 40 million kilograms of food annually. Casey says: “We’re increasingly seeing a direct correlation between food insecurity and mental health and wellbeing. We know that people who experience it feel stressed, they feel anxious, they feel stigmatised and ashamed.” Already marginalised groups are more likely to experience food insecurity, compounding existing issues of unemployment, age-related illness and homelessness. On the other hand, children who eat breakfast find it easier to concentrate and have better academic outcomes. Eliminating food waste means less dependence on land, water, energy and fuel that contributes to greenhouse gases. A healthy, balanced diet can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and even some cancers. Plus, the social return on this investment - benefits beyond simple financials - is substantial. Casey says every kilogram of food and groceries that Foodbank distributes delivers a $23 social return on investment for adults. For children in their school breakfast programs, it’s $110. Milk donations alone represent more than $85 million in social, economic and environmental benefits annually. “All of those social benefits we can really put a value on,” Casey says. “That’s the impact of the dairy industry working together with Foodbank.” What matters to you, matters to us too.

192	Amber Murrey, an American academic, was “ecstatic” about being appointed associate professor in geography at Oxford University last year. But the dream turned sour two weeks ago when the Home Office refused to grant visas for her two daughters, aged four and nine, to live with her in the UK. Dr Murrey used an immigration lawyer to make sure the visa applications for her daughters, who have US passports, went smoothly, and was not anticipating a problem. Her husband has business commitments overseeing property renovations in Cameroon, where he is from, and the couple had included joint written consent for their daughters to live with her in Oxford. “When I read those three unemotional sentences saying they were denying my children entry to the UK I felt complete disbelief,” she says. “I had already packed the girls’ bags and bought their school uniforms. It is insane that you can have a legal document with both parents’ consent to have the children with their mother and they simply say no, that can’t happen.” Her case will add to a tide of anger among academics, who say the Home Office’s hostile immigration environment is making it difficult for talented people from abroad to forge an academic career in the UK. This is the second time in a month that the Home Office has refused a visa to an American academic based at Oxford University. Last month Education Guardian reported that Dr Elizabeth Ford, a music historian about to start a fellowship at Oxford, was given two weeks to leave after eight years in the UK, because the Home Office said it had granted her last visa erroneously. Young overseas academics say that universities are now so frightened of the tough new visa regime that, in some cases, they are automatically rejecting international candidates for jobs they should be eligible for. Dr Murrey, an expert on social change in Africa, who has published widely and previously held positions at universities in Cairo, Massachusetts and Ethiopia, took up her post in Oxford last year. Without proof of residency she couldn’t set up schooling or somewhere to live in advance, so the couple decided she should establish a base in Oxford before moving the family. While she has been returning to Cameroon to see her daughters and husband in the university holidays, she says this has been an emotional strain. “It has been really hard, because I need to spend more time with my daughters but I am wary of being out of the UK for too long in case it jeopardises the terms of my tier 2 visa,” she says. The news has hit the family hard. Murrey says: “My nine-year-old had been so excited about her new school, and our apartment near a meadow. After I told her their visas had been denied she told me: ‘I know why they rejected me, it’s because I’ve been misbehaving this week, Mama’. We both cried very hard.” The Home Office rejection letters say that under immigration rules a child may only be given a visa if both parents are living together in the UK. This would be waived if the parent living here had sole responsibility for the children, or the other partner had died. “This policy seems to operate under the guise of keeping families together, but it is splitting mine apart,” Murrey says. Ultimately the couple want the whole family to live together in Oxford, but Murrey says that right now they are just trying to “do what is best for our daughters”. She doesn’t know whether she has been singled out as a risk because her husband is from Cameroon. “We have family members and friends there who have been rejected for British visas in the past,” she says. The Wellcome Trust, a health research charity, has evidence of around 100 cases in which academics, especially from African countries, have been refused visas to come to the UK for conferences, often for spurious reasons. The African Studies Association UK found that at least 17 delegates were refused entry for its biennial academic conference at Birmingham University last year. Insa Nolte, a lecturer in African culture at Birmingham, is frustrated that academics can’t appeal against these decisions. “There is no process to identify immigration officers who consistently misjudge cases or who make racist assumptions,” she says. “If we are going to find solutions to global concerns like food security and climate change, we need to collaborate with academics across the world.” Meanwhile, young international academics who have gained their PhDs in Britain say some universities, fearful of the tougher visa rules, are automatically rejecting non-UK nationals for jobs for which they should be eligible. Dr Lisa Kalayji, an American who did her PhD in sociology at Edinburgh University, says: “In one case it was a job at another university I knew I could get a visa for. There was a pop-up as soon as I clicked the box saying I would need a visa. It said: ‘It is extremely unlikely that we would be able to sponsor you and we recommend that you abandon the application now’.” She applied anyway, but at 1am the next day received a rejection email. “It was clear that was an automated response, presumably because I was not a UK national.” Kalayji has given up applying to British universities. “Living with the hostile environment in the UK has worn me down so much that I don’t want to be an immigrant any more. The emotional tax is too great. I’m going home.” A young Canadian academic, who wished to remain anonymous, recently encountered a similar pop-up window when applying for a full-time lectureship that should have qualified her for a tier 2 visa at a London university. “It said: ‘It is highly unlikely that you would obtain permission to work in the UK on the basis of an offer for this … job. It is therefore recommended that you do not continue with your application’.” She says this felt like a sign saying: “foreigners go home”. She blames the government rather than universities, but says that after a year of applying for jobs she is beginning to feel desperate. Gareth Edwards, a senior geography lecturer at the University of East Anglia and co-founder of International and Broke, which campaigns against high visa costs for academics, says international academics are getting this sort of pop-up warning when applying for permanent lectureships. “Those jobs are most certainly eligible for sponsorship,” he says. Melany Cruz, a Chilean PhD student at Birmingham University, applied for an academic position elsewhere and also got an apparently automated rejection at 1am the next working day. “I’m sure not many HR people are working at 1am. I don’t think my application ever made it to the panel,” she says. “It is starting to feel impossible to find a job as an international PhD student, which is such a shame as I love what I do.” Paul Boustead, chair of the HR practitioners’ group Universities Human Resources, says universities want to recruit the most talented staff but some roles are simply “unlikely to obtain a work permit”. The Home Office says:“We welcome international academics from across the globe and recognise their contribution to the UK’s world-leading education sector. All UK visa applications are considered on their individual merits, on the basis of the evidence available, and in line with the immigration rules.” This story was amended on 1 October 2019 to correct the spelling of Lisa Kalayji’s name.
193	“You don’t look Aboriginal – you’ve got blue eyes.” The lack of awareness and level of audacity in this statement can be measured in equal parts. A lack of awareness of the diversity of our people; a lack of awareness that this statement embodies the most common form of racism we face. Statements such as this are based on perpetuated stereotypes that seek to confine our diverse peoples to a single layer of identity. When we do not fit the mould conceptualised by the dominant culture, a certain level of discomfort and uncertainty arises. When we challenge these statements there is an uncomfortable and brisk shift in the discourse. When we stand strong in our identity and its complexity we are quickly labelled with the derogatory stereotypes of a people who, previous to our challenge, we could not possibly be. Then comes the counter-challenge that seeks to invalidate our right to identify, to assume that the disparities and injustices that are forced upon our people could not possibly apply to us. The audacity of such statements astounds me. How does an individual come to a place where they feel they have the unreserved right to question the identity of another? When was an individual’s identity attributed solely to the colour of their eyes or the shape of their nose? To even begin to understand the complexities of identity, connection and belonging when it comes to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, there needs to be a process of critical self-reflection and unlearning. There needs to be historical truth telling and acknowledgment. How do we build resilience among our people in the face of persistent, systemic and individual racism? As a midwife having worked in the state health system, this type of behaviour is common and accepted. As a resilient people, I don’t understand how we continue to accept a society, a government, a health system and a health workforce that is not responsive to our needs as First Nations peoples. Our need to be culturally safe, our need to be acknowledged, understood and respected, our need to have equitable access to services and equitable outcomes in health, education, employment – in life! I am concerned the conversations we have about racism, about dominant cultural paradigms and their impact on the health and wellbeing of our people and communities, do not seem to be changing. It is heartbreaking to hear our current Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nursing and midwifery students sharing stories of culturally unsafe systems, of racism and a lack of support and understanding. It is time that we as a nation recognise that the gap that we see, the gap that we so easily talk about but fail to address, is systemic. The systems and the frameworks that form the foundations of our society have been developed by and for the dominant culture. It is time we collectively challenge these systems; it is time we demand Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledges be included in all systems. It is this level of structural, systemic reform that is required if we are to disrupt the revolving discourse around achieving equity in this country. I’d like to acknowledge the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander elders, our ancestors, our warriors, nurses, midwives, academics, educators, advocates, activists, policy writers and community members who have been challenging these systems since before I was born. I acknowledge the tireless work that has been done, that continues, and that is yet to begin. To the self-professed “leaders” of this country, those who continue to develop and enforce systems to benefit the majority and marginalise the minorities, I ask: how dare you? Neville Bonner asked this same question of Australia and our government at the 1998 constitutional convention. Every time I glimpse the mangroves that hug the shore of Ukerebagh Island, his birthplace, whether it be from Fingal or the other side of the river in Tweed, I think about this question. How dare you continue to pretend you don’t see us, that you don’t see the inequity, the injustice and the solution. It is time to acknowledge that you cannot and should not speak for us. It is time to relinquish the control and cease the continuing attempts of colonisation upon our peoples and communities. Our people hold the stories of a millennia, inter-generational and intrinsic knowledges that enable us to survive and thrive in an environment and society that seeks to disempower, silence and destroy. It is time that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are acknowledged as the solution. True consultation, cultural safety, recognition and embedding of our unique knowledges and frameworks throughout all systems is the only way we will move forward, together. • Marni Tuala is a Moorung Moobar woman of the Bundjalung nation, midwife and president of the Congress of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Nurses and Midwives
194	Driving into the low hills outside Moreton-in-Marsh, the archetypal Cotswold village, I was slightly concerned about finding John Pawson’s farmhouse from the sparse address I’d been given. I need not have worried. Pawson, probably the most influential British architectural designer of his generation, has for 40 years been a minimalist scourge of chocolate box and chintz. I pass half a dozen farm dwellings in various states of confected picturesque before I reach one that instantly gives itself away with the discreet rigour of its window lines and the angle of its cut stone and the crispest junction of lawn and gravel. I don’t know what the opposite of ramshackle is exactly, but Pawson does. He and his wife Catherine bought the farm buildings here six years ago. They had been owned by the neighbouring dairy farming family of nine siblings, two of whom, both bachelors in their 80s, had lived in them all their adult lives. The brothers inhabited a bedroom each and a makeshift kitchen in one of the add-ons to the original 17th-century house. The rest of the jumble of rooms and barns were filled with old farm tools and junk, and decorated with wallpapers of uncertain vintage. They are not any longer. After a brief introduction to the European elm and raw stainless steel of his perfectly hollowed-out kitchen, Pawson, who is a boyish 70 years old, walks me first around the medieval carp pond beside which the buildings are set. He removed 500 lorry loads of silt from the pond, once the preserve of the local monastery, and added a mahogany Cambridge-built punt. “Catherine had always hankered after a place in the country but I was happy in London,” Pawson says of the decision to buy this place. His wife had asked an estate agent to send her details of rose-covered cottages, but among them was this, with its 24 acres of ancient and listed “ridge and furrow” fields. Pawson took a look and thought: this is more like it. “The old brothers had made the bread oven their telephone booth. They had a cider press,” he says. When he first went up to one attic Pawson discovered a room that no one had set foot in for half a century and which was filled corner to corner by cobwebs illuminated by a shaft of sunlight. His great regret was that he blundered into that spidery domain without his usually ever-present camera. Over the six years since, he has stripped out and given sympathetic order to the Grade II listed buildings, using lath and plaster for the walls, five eras of clay tiles for the roofs, and employing his trusted palette of local stone – in terrazzo floors – sharp-planed woodwork, Italian marble and as little else as possible. The building now takes its place in a new monograph of a decade of work that includes Pawson’s Design Museum in London, a Cistercian Abbey in Hungary, the Jaffa Hotel in Tel Aviv, and his Life House retreat in rural Powys. (Pawson likes to say he works on “everything from a spoon to a monastery”.) He sees the Cotswold house as a manifesto as well as a home. Pawson has always been stimulated by the domestic. His breakthrough project, creating stark geometries in the apartment of his first wife Hester van Royen, established his aesthetic. The west London home he created behind a Victorian facade in Notting Hill was the defining interior of the 1990s, ushering in double-height ceilings and ascetic-looking kitchens that met gardens seamlessly through high glass walls. Home Farm is a greener, rural iteration of that less-is-more dogma. He prefaces a brief note about the building in his pared-back journal – one paragraph and three images for each month – with a quote from Henry Thoreau: “Do what you love. Know your own bone; gnaw at it, bury it, unearth it and gnaw it still.” As he walks me around the newly gnawed volumes of his house – with its triple-glazed calm, and delight in perspective (there is a point that allows you to look the entire light-and-shade length of the newly connected 50m interior) – he dwells on its exposed character: the raw 10mm-thick stainless steel of worktops and window frames, which show the watermarks of the foundry process. The subtle shades of the lime plaster walls. “We are obsessional about detail, obviously,” he says. “And because it is my own place, perhaps even more so. Though it is obviously the last job anyone in the office wants to work on – the boss’s house.” Before you meet Pawson, you fear he might be as austere as his seamless kitchen cupboards, but he wears any control freakery lightly, giving the sense that his work is serious so he does not have to be (his rooms share that sense, making dining tables a single focus, like stage sets for shared pleasure). He grew up in a big house near Halifax, on the edge of the moors. His family had a publicly listed textile business that dated to before the industrial revolution. The plan was for him eventually to take a hand in running it, but that lasted until he was 24 and went travelling to Japan. “The yearning was always getting to London,” he says. “but there wasn’t an obvious route, so I escaped and went around the world instead. I started in Japan and never left.” He was 30 by the time he made it to London, by which time the family business was being run by his sister (it was eventually, like all those Halifax textile factories, sold off and closed). The idea of Japan had come from watching a film made by Tony Richardson, about a Zen Buddhist master. “It was so exquisitely filmed, the monks practising kendo at dawn and all that, I thought, ‘Fuck, this is it, I’ll go there and become enlightened.’” It was 1973. Pawson lasted half a day at a Zen monastery, where they put him to work cleaning. He saw enough in Japan to make him reluctant to return to Halifax, however, and eventually discovered his real vocation when he spent a year – “mostly trying not to get in the way” – in the studio of the great Japanese designer Shiro Kuramata. He brought Kuramata’s disciplined attention to the beauty of material and form back to London. That attention, in which every sparse gesture and junction is made to matter, still serves him well. But inevitably, to achieve such idealised simplicity of form requires 30 kinds of human sweat and chaos. At one point in our tour of the house he points out a section of concrete work that provides a link between the buildings. Part of the concrete is smooth, some is more disturbed. “We had this brilliant guy from Belgium do it,” he says. “But each part had to set before the next could be done and getting him back each time was more difficult. He was a passionate guy and going through some issues at the time, and you see that in the finish.” Pawson’s weakness is always to be “too reasonable” in such circumstances, he admits; he has learned to leave on-site negotiation to others. “I get drawn into the human issues, you know: ‘Don’t worry about the wall, just get yourself well.’ On paper and in my head I am entirely obsessional – but not if there is a human cost.” That contradiction plays out in his manner; he appears too easygoing for someone so committed to precision. In a room that will become a larder once a cooling system has been installed the shelves have become a minor dumping area for kids’ toys and other boxes of stuff – Pawson’s three grown-up children are all regular visitors here; his daughter, the eldest, has a one-year-old son. “Clutter…” I note. “Fucking hell!” he says, in mock alarm. And then, as if it is a well-worn internal mantra: “Life’s a compromise when you live with people. When Catherine goes away, I get everything absolutely in order and she goes slightly mad because I tidy up her papers. And within seconds she has messed up my work, but I am so happy to have her back I don’t mind.” Where does it come from, that impulse to empty space of objects? “I don’t know. I just remember at a very early age, going back to school [he was at Eton] and really loving travelling light. Having very little just made me feel free.” Does that mania for clean lines not require constant vigilance though? “I do enjoy tidying up. These are Catherine’s things,” he says, gesturing to books on a desk. “My instinct would be to put them in a cupboard.” He recalls how he did just that before one journalist came to his house, and there was the question: what are your cupboards like? He opened the one he had crammed stuff into and it all fell out on top of him. They have had a full year at the finished house now, and are here most weekends and for a month in the summer. Pawson’s original plan was to work here, but he finds that once he arrives his mind seems to empty of deadline pressure. One of the problems of framing all the rolling views with such care is that there is always too much to look at. He still works best, he says, in his windowless basement office at the practice in King’s Cross, where the only visual stimulation is a white wall. He runs a small office of 25; they do designs and work with other practices on engineering and construction. Over the next five years they will probably have 30 projects that might vary from a hotel to an exhibition, he suggests. “Every one will have some part of it which is me, otherwise there is no point.” Does he hire people in his own image? “Definitely not if I can help it.” How is he as a boss? “Well,” he says, “People tend to stay. I do have a temper but it is over quickly. I always start the year saying to everyone, ‘OK this year I am not going to lose it’. Usually I make it to 4 January. For my birthday they did a whole load of slogans of things I have yelled at one time or another. My favourite was: “Find me that letter that says I’m a genius!” In his book, he notes how “the client is the critic”. He says that the sentence he most dreads hearing is: “I have put together some ideas for you to download before we meet.” Some commissions seem like gifts, however. He still cannot believe his fortune in being asked to design the Abbey complex in Hungary. “To begin with I thought it was a joke,” he says. “We used to have lots of wind-ups in the office; people would go out to a phone box and pretend to be a sheikh with an emirate to design or whatever.” Were the monks exacting clients? “Well, they gave me a file of every room’s optimum temperature,” he says. “And all 80 of them had been allowed to come up with their own spec. It was all ‘I would like my chest of drawers to be this high’ or whatever.” He obviously disregarded all that and made them all the same. He stayed at the monastery for a week when it was finished, living in the dorm, getting up with the monks, eating with them, praying seven times a day. It was a silent Trappist order. How did he manage? “I didn’t get the calling, unfortunately,” he says. “But I could see the attractions of not drinking too much and getting good sleep and not talking. I should really go back every year. Catherine is Catholic and very keen for me to convert.” It is tempting to see a spiritual impulse in his work – certainly others appear to see it; as well as the Hungarian project he has lately designed a church in St Moritz and a log chapel in a forest in Germany. His books of photographs tend toward the sublime. Does he recognise that in himself? If it exists he traces it back to childhood. “My mother would have liked me to become a missionary,” he says. “She was the daughter of quite strict Methodists, saintly in a Yorkshire way. The doctor burst into floods of tears when she died.” He suggests that his mother found her considerable inherited wealth difficult. “She dressed very modestly and didn’t like material things. My father – and I – in contrast, always quite liked the best of things, nice cars, a big old Irish wolfhound for a dog, the best racing bike.” Would it be fair to say he has found a way of marrying those two forces? “Perhaps.” Certainly from the moment that Calvin Klein called to ask Pawson to design his flagship New York store in 1993, versions of his minimalism have attracted that bonus-rich, money-market generation that justifies its outrageous fortune with painful hours in the gym and eye-wateringly expensive interiors that apparently eschew worldly goods. Pawson is currently working on a dozen private houses, as well as two hotels for his longtime collaborator Ian Schrager. He insists that he still finds his brand of opulent minimalism as bracing as ever. He can’t imagine retirement. Is it terribly strange to be 70, I wonder? “I think it was a mistake to celebrate it with a party,” he says, with mock glumness. “Catherine insisted on it. But it now means I can’t pretend it hasn’t happened. Up until then I think I have always vaguely assumed I was about the same age as the person I was talking to, from the mid-30s upwards, at least.” He went to a school reunion of his Eton year not long ago (Sir Nicholas Soames was in his class). “I got there and was directed to a room full of red-faced, white-haired old men. I took one look and thought I had the wrong place.” As he went to leave a voice boomed out: “Pawson!” “I thought ‘Christ, this is me.’” Catherine calls us to lunch in the kitchen at the long elm table fronting a glass wall that rises like a sash on a vast counterweight. Pawson and his wife are currently writing a cookbook based around the farm kitchen. “At the moment there are a hundred recipes, just everyday stuff,” he says, while admitting that he does “more of the eating and the advising” than the cooking. We share a warm salad of charred peppers and tomatoes on sourdough and then ice cream with a peach compote. Pawson has, of course, designed the plates and the bowls and the cutlery and the water glasses. Their collective effect seems to demand to make each mouthful a mindful haiku. I try not to crunch too hard on the toast. Is there anything that he hasn’t designed? He looks around. “I have done the taps. And the light switches, the escutcheons and the door knobs are mine. And these salt and pepper pots.” He picks up a weighty minimalist oval. “I suppose I like to see if I can do better than what there is.” When he says better, what does he mean? “Well, simpler,” he says, simply.

195	The Paris surrealists gave the name “exquisite corpse” to the game of consequences, where one person draws part of a body, folds the paper, and passes it on, so that when unfolded, it reveals one stitched-together creature. Meena Kandasamy’s slim, inventive book plays on this technique. Each page is divided into two columns. On the right, a story unfolds about a London couple: Maya, who is English, and Tunisian film-maker Karim. On the left, Kandasamy comments on her creative process, her own life, and – increasingly – documents political horrors occurring in her native India. Maya and Karim watch films, fight and discuss their awful fathers. Their portion is a tight close-up of a relationship, exposing every flaw. Kandasamy is also a poet, and it shows in some brilliantly distilled writing. But as they have only half the 100 pages, they remain elusive. Their narrative acquires weight from the annotations, which document Kandasamy’s struggle watching political events from afar, seeing friends killed and arrested. She grew up in Tamil Nadu and became a leftwing activist, but now lives in London. Kandasamy worries about absenting herself from the fight and the inadequacy of fiction: “My concerns and my solidarity align with the oppressed and the exploited. And yet, creating art under capitalism, I sit here, playing with form, with format, with fonts.” She craves the “refuge” fiction can provide, but recognises the need to bear witness to reality. Exquisite Cadavers does both: its domestic story is an escape, while its rage-filled notes are a work of consciousness-raising. Kandasamy details rapes of young girls; she lists the many forms of opposition that get people murdered in India. At the end of the novel, the two parts silently unite. Karim returns to Tunis to help his brother, wrongfully detained, and Maya feels an impulse to join him, to look beyond the narrow confines of relationship and home. This portion is unadorned: Kandasamy’s notes stop, as if she’s decided even her fictional creations must confront political injustice. Kandasamy explains in a preface where the dual structure came from. Her last novel, When I Hit You, drew on her experience in an abusive marriage – but she was angered by reviewers calling it “memoir”. So she tried writing “a story as removed from my own as possible” but where every influence “would be referenced and documented”. The fictional narrative doesn’t seem that removed, really. Maya and Karim are still a young artsy educated London couple. Karim may be a film-maker but Kandasamy stingingly shows he’s expected to tell certain stories – just like the immigrant novelist. Kandasamy even acknowledges the urge to feed herself into Maya, when she – a young mother – makes her character pregnant: “I cannot make her me. Then again, I cannot relate to her if I do not share anything with her.” This does not mean Exquisite Cadavers is a failed experiment – it’s a fascinating one, and we get to witness the author working it out on the page. The cleverness of Kandasamy’s bricolage is that it allows her to explicitly separate fiction and memoir, while ensuring they’re intimately intertwined.

196	On a journey from London King’s Cross to Edinburgh Waverley with LNER, I had a ticket for the 14.00 train. I am a student and was moving back to Scotland from London for the new college year, carrying three large suitcases. I was unable to get on the 14.00 train as it was full. Seeing me struggling to board, a member of LNER staff told me to get on the next train at 15.00. She assured me my ticket would be valid, so I took her advice and waited for the next train. I checked with customer services and was satisfied my ticket would be valid. To my surprise, therefore, the ticket manager on board told me it definitely wasn’t. I explained the whole situation, however she insisted that customer services would have issued a new ticket for the 15.00 train if my story was true. I was upset by her aggressive manner, insisting my story wasn’t true. She got a colleague to join in the conversation and demanded I pay an additional £88.30 to stay on this train. Seeing no other way out and very intimidated, I agreed. I immediately demanded the money back but haven’t received a reply. EB, Edinburgh LNER says it has reviewed your complaint and is making contact to resolve it, adding: “We appreciate the ticketing system can be confusing. To ensure customers are travelling on the appropriate train a series of announcements are made on board before departure. This allows those with invalid tickets the chance to depart the train.” It says it is taking the allegations about the crew’s conduct very seriously but points out that “the on-board train manager did use discretion and offered the option to upgrade EB’s ticket to an Anytime Single, rather than issuing a significantly more expensive new ticket”. As a goodwill gesture, it is offering a voucher to use on your next journey. And finally… Reader MH has a cheery tale: “I had a pair of Randolph sunglasses for more than a decade. Last week a weld failed and a lens fell out and smashed. I emailed Randolph, and by return it asked for the model number. Within a week they sent a new pair, free, from the US. No questions asked.

197	Hold on to your warp-speeds; don’t exit the airlock just yet. The authors of a 2017 study which found that reading science fiction “makes you stupid” have conducted a follow-up that found that it’s only bad sci-fi that has this effect: a well-written slice of sci-fi will be read just as thoroughly as a literary story. Two years ago, Washington and Lee University professors Chris Gavaler and Dan Johnson published a paper in which they revealed that when readers were given a sci-fi story peopled by aliens and androids and set on a space ship, as opposed to a similar one set in reality, “the science fiction setting triggered poorer overall reading” and appeared to “predispose readers to a less effortful and comprehending mode of reading – or what we might term non-literary reading”. But after critics suggested that merely changing elements of a mainstream story into sci-fi tropes did not make for a quality story, Gavaler and Johnson decided to revisit the research. This time, 204 participants were given one of two stories to read: both were called “Ada” and were identical apart from one word, to provide the strictest possible control. The “literary” version begins: “My daughter is standing behind the bar, polishing a wine glass against a white cloth.” The science-fiction variant begins: “My robot is standing behind the bar, polishing a wine glass against a white cloth.” In what Gavaler and Johnson call “a significant departure” from their previous study, readers of both texts scored the same in comprehension, “both accumulatively and when divided into the comprehension subcategories of mind, world, and plot”. The presence of the word “robot” did not reduce merit evaluation, effort reporting, or objective comprehension scores, they write; in their previous study, these had been reduced by the sci-fi setting. “This difference between studies is presumably a result of differences between our two science-fiction texts,” they say. Gavaler said he was “pretty startled” by the result. “It turns out our first study didn’t reveal much about sci-fi generally but about what we would now have to call ‘non-literary sci-fi’. The text we used for our new study is instead ‘literary sci-fi’, and it didn’t trigger poor reading at all. Not even when it was introduced with a paragraph describing the story as non-literary. Readers basically ignored that intro and engaged actively with the text itself anyway,” he said. “I assume there were plenty of readers in the sample groups who don’t like sci-fi, but it didn’t matter because they still responded to the literary qualities of the story. Their comprehension didn’t drop this time.” The paper, titled The Literary Genre Effect, is due to be published later this year in the journal Scientific Study of Literature. “I’m hopeful that it will once-and-for-all give definitive evidence that literary fiction and genre fiction, specifically science fiction, are not separate categories,” said Gavaler.
198	The iPhone 11 is Apple’s latest lower cost smartphone for 2019 that’s clearly aimed at a broader market, offering most of what its top phones do but for £320 less. Costing from £729, the iPhone 11 is also £20 cheaper than last year’s iPhone XR was on launch – the phone it has now replaced. In fact the iPhone 11 is identical on the outside to the iPhone XR in almost all the ways that matter. It’s the same size and weight. It’s got the same glass and aluminium design, same 6.1in LCD screen with rounded corners, the same large notch at the top and same thick bezels around the sides. Flip it over and it’s got the same glass rear, except that “iPhone” is no longer written on the back and the Apple logo is positioned lower. The biggest difference is the new large, square camera lump in the top left corner, which on the iPhone 11 houses a new dual camera system. The phone is well built, feeling extremely solid and it has the best LCD screen you’re likely to see on a phone although it isn’t as good-looking, colour rich, bright or high contrast as the OLED screens fitted to the iPhone 11 Pro or Apple’s many rivals costing £500 and up. The iPhone 11 also suffers from the same disadvantages as the iPhone XR before it, namely it’s fairly heavy and wide with rounded edges that provide little in the way of grip. Compared to Samsung’s Galaxy S10, which has the same size 6.1in screen, the iPhone 11 is 5.3mm wider and 37g heavier and significantly harder to use one-handed. Specifications Screen: 6.1in liquid retina HD (LCD) (326ppi) Processor: Apple A13 Bionic RAM: 4GB Storage: 64, 128 or 256GB Operating system: iOS 13 Camera: dual 12MP rear cameras with OIS, 12MP front-facing camera Connectivity: LTE, wifi 6, NFC, Bluetooth 5, lightning, ultra wideband and GPS Dimensions: 150.9mm x 75.7mm x 8.3mm Weight: 194g A13 Bionic chip The iPhone 11 shares the same core as the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max: Apple’s latest A13 Bionic chip, 4GB of RAM and at least 64GB of storage. It’s the fastest and most efficient of Apple’s chips yet, but the reality is that it’s very difficult to tell. The iPhone 11 doesn’t feel any faster than last year’s iPhone XR/XS, or in fact the iPhone X in day-to-day usage. That’s not surprising as Apple focuses its chips on doing the things you’d normally do more efficiently, with power to do something unusual if you need it. That means the iPhone 11 should still be a top-performer in two, three, maybe four years from now. So really the only thing you need to know is that the iPhone 11 will handle everything you are likely to do, and then some. Apple also says that it’s managed to make the iPhone 11 last an hour longer than the iPhone XR, which lasted 32 hours between charges in my testing. I’m happy to report that’s a bit of an underestimate. The iPhone 11 lasts closer to 35 hours between charges, which makes it the longest-lasting iPhone to have crossed my test bench, getting me from 7am though until 6pm the following day. That was after the iOS 13.1.1 update, while using it as my primary device without a smartwatch attached, sending and receiving 150 emails and messages, 80 push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day. Charging the iPhone 11 with the included 5W charger is glacially slow, taking well over four hours to hit 100% from zero. Why Apple still ships a £729 phone with such a pathetic charger, I don’t know. With the £29 18W USB-C charger and £19 USB-C to Lightning cable that ships in the box with the iPhone 11 Pro, the iPhone 11 fully charged in just over 100 minutes, reaching 80% in well under and hour, which is more like it. Any USB-C power delivery chargers of 18W or higher will achieve the same results and can be had for one-third less. It’s also worth noting that iOS 13 includes a battery optimising feature, which is designed to learn your habits and only charge the battery past 80% when it thinks you need it to extend its longevity. Apple is also clearly slowing charging down to a trickle above 95% regardless of charger, meaning that it’s probably not worth trying to charge it much beyond 90% if you don’t need to. iOS 13.1.1 The iPhone 11 came out of the box with iOS 13 but was quickly updated to iOS 13.1 and then iOS 13.1.1, which was a good thing, as prior to the updates it was filled with bugs giving me all kinds of issues on three different iPhone 11 series phones. First off, the camera confirmation for restoring it from another iPhone didn’t work. Then I was immediately stuck in a password-demand loop for an email account, which ended up with me having to hit the cancel button and then quickly enter one character of my 35-character password before the password demand popped back up blocking me from entering more. Hit cancel, rinse and repeat. Absolutely infuriating. I had issues with location permissions getting stuck on “ask every time” for some apps. I also had several hard lockups of the phone prompting the three-button combo force restart procedure (up, down, hold power for ages), text in widgets and other areas was compressed and overlapping each other, and sometimes the camera failed to activate when launched. Most of the problems have been solved since the update to iOS 13.1.1, and it even added an extra hour to my battery tests. The big new features for iOS 13 are dark mode, which turns the interface from a predominately black text on white background to white text on a dark background, either manually or on a schedule. You can now also long-press on control centre buttons such as Bluetooth or wifi, first to open a up more detail, then a second time to open up a quick connect menu as well as a button to take you straight to the appropriate place in the settings app for more extensive changes. It is a user-friendly feature that Android has had for years, so it’s good to finally see Apple catch up. A few new privacy options are welcome, including the ability to silence unknown and spam callers and finer-grain location permissions. Menstrual cycle tracking is now integrated into the Health app alongside headphone audio level, and there’s a new summary view, which makes the app more friendly and useful at a glance. It’s worth pointing out that Apple still provides the industry’s longest software support lifecycle of about five years from release where the best rivals cap out at about three years. It means you can safely use the phone for longer as you will continue to get important security updates as well as new features via iOS version updates. Camera The iPhone 11 has a new dual 12-megapixel camera on the back. Oddly you get an ultra-wide camera alongside a standard camera, not the more typical 2x optical zoom camera. That means you’ve effectively got 0.5x and 1x optical zoom then up to 5x digital zoom, which is good, but doesn’t hold a flame to real optical zoom. Apple has significantly upped its game in the camera department this year, particularly in poor lighting conditions. Photos in good lighting conditions are some of the best on a smartphone, producing detail-rich and colour-accurate photos. The main camera is good, but the ultrawide is arguably the best in its class and is a lot of fun to shoot with. Other than your typical ultra-wide vistas, you can also use the new camera to photograph more of a building or object you can’t get far enough away from to use the main camera. Portrait mode is good too, and unlike on the XR can be used on more than just people. Apple’s smart HDR mode is also improved, producing images that are closer to class-leading Google Pixel cameras. But the biggest boost is Apple’s new night mode, which finally brings the iPhone’s very low-light performance up to scratch with the very best. It’s not as fast as Huawei’s P30 Pro, which doesn’t need a special night mode to shoot similar photos, nor quite as dramatic as Google’s Pixel 3, but produces images that are often lighter and better controlled. The automatic mode takes multiple frames between one and three seconds when handheld, depending on available light and how much you are shaking the phone. Stick it on a tripod and you can set it to 30 seconds, which is best illustrated with starry sky shots – something I couldn’t test in dank, rainy Britain. The iPhone still struggles a little with indoor lighting where it’s not quite dark enough to benefit from night mode so produces images that are a little dark and lacking in detail. The selfie camera in particular produces somewhat grainy images here, but shoots great photos in better lighting conditions. Video capture from the rear camera is fantastic, and easy to use, arguably better than rivals. The front-facing camera can also offers slow-motion selfies, which kids will love. Overall the camera on the iPhone 11 is a big step up, equalling or exceeding rivals from the first half of 2019 in the most important features, although the lack of an optical zoom is disappointing. Observations The iPhone 11 is water resistant to IP68 standards of up to 2 metres for 30 seconds, which is 1 metre deeper than last year’s iPhone XR Bluetooth performance is much improved, with stronger connections to even the weakest of headphones The volume slider shows you a bespoke icon of the headphones you are wearing – if they are made by Apple You can swipe to type on Apple’s default keyboard in iOS 13 Face ID is still best-in-class, now slightly faster and works at slightly wider angles The new U1 chip enables enhanced location abilities, but so far it’s only used for directional AirDrop file sharing, which will be most useful for narrowing down which iPhone you want to send a file to in a cluster of iPhones – not something I do very often Price The iPhone 11 costs £729 for 64GB of storage, £779 for 128GB or £879 for 256GB, and is available in white, black, green, yellow, purple or red. For comparison, the iPhone XR costs £629, the OnePlus 7 costs £499, the Samsung S10e costs £669, the Honor 20 Pro costs £550, the iPhone 11 Pro costs £1,049 and the iPhone 11 Pro Max costs £1,149. Verdict The iPhone 11 is an excellent but boring smartphone. It’s got a three-year-old design, which Apple broke the mould with in 2017 when it launched the iPhone X but now looks dated against the competition, particularly with the thicker bezels on the LCD screen. Things have moved on in the era of the all-screen smartphone. It’s fairly large, heavy and difficult to grip and use with one hand, but is also extremely well made and feels solid. These are all attributes shared by its predecessor the iPhone XR, as the iPhone 11 is essentially new guts in last year’s design. At £729 the iPhone 11 isn’t exactly cheap, costing the same as the top-of-the-line phones from competitors. But what you get for your £729 is Apple’s latest top-of-the-range processor with performance to match. Battery life that will easily see you into a second day, maybe a third if you’re careful. Camera performance that is up there with the very best, but lacking an optical zoom, replaced instead by a fun ultra-wide angle camera. You also get five years of software updates, which can’t be sniffed at. With a battery swap at some point there’s no reason an iPhone 11 won’t last you five years if you’re careful with it. In some tests the glass appears fairly tough to break, but less so in others, so whether it will survive real-world drops remains to be seen. So the iPhone 11 is the iPhone for people who don’t really care about smartphones and just want a new iPhone. Except that it’s not that simple. Apple still sells the iPhone XR, which is essentially the same phone minus a second camera and one year less of software support, which is still at least four years, for £100 less at £629. And then there’s the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max, which have a third camera, a significantly better screen and the cachet of being “the best iPhone”. If your primary driver is to buy the best, cheapest iPhone you can get, that’s the iPhone XR in 2019. If you want the best iPhone you can get, that’s one of the new iPhone 11 Pro line. So where does that leave the iPhone 11? Pros: great camera, night mode water resistant, wireless charging, Face ID, good battery life, good performance, good screen, long software support Cons: no headphone socket, no fingerprint scanner, dated design, expensive, no fast charger or USB-C cable in the box, no headphones adapter in the box Other reviews Best smartphone 2019: iPhone, OnePlus, Samsung and Huawei compared and ranked Samsung Galaxy S10 review: the sweet spot Samsung Galaxy S10e review: the cheaper one OnePlus 7 review: competition-beating performance for less OnePlus 7 Pro review: an absolute beast in every way
199	The Labour party has said it would abolish Ofsted and its one-word judgments. Local authorities would carry out regular “health checks” instead, while inspectors would be called in for more in-depth visits. What do teachers and parents think? Should Ofsted be abolished? Henry Emoni maths teacher, the Beacon school, Banstead, Surrey Yes. Ofsted creates an environment of fear, anxiety and worry for teachers. To prepare for an Ofsted visit, you may have to do a lot of tick-box exercises, regimented things that don’t add value but help a school to look good. It inevitably adds to a teacher’s workload. Plus the current system is so punitive. There’s no supportive element to it. An external body comes in and passes judgment on a school. A bad judgment can feel like a prison sentence, involving years of seriously irrelevant work and pressure from headteachers. That has a negative effect on classroom teachers and, inevitably, students. Schools should be held accountable but they should be supported as well as evaluated, ideally by other school leaders with local expertise, as part of a continuous improvement process. Context matters and, unlike Ofsted inspectors, local teachers will understand the school’s demographic and its history over the years. Schools should be told: these are your strengths, these are your weaknesses and these are some brilliant schools in your geographical area, we’re going to support you to work together collaboratively. I would not shy away from someone coming in regularly to tell me how I can improve. I’m a professional, I want to do my job better. But I want someone who’s going to put an arm around me and walk on that journey with me, someone who will support me, not just tell me all the things I’m not doing right. James Pope consultant and former headteacher, who resigned on TV in the BBC documentary School No, because accountability is important – and we could spend a lot of unnecessary time restructuring the accountability system in line with what Labour is saying. However, there is too much human interpretation in the inspection framework and I don’t think it should continue in its current format. What needs to change is Ofsted’s job, so inspectors are no longer trying to root out under-performance, inadequacy and failure. Ofsted needs to be a lot more realistic about what it can accurately, effectively and specifically hold schools accountable for. I don’t think it’s feasible or possible to inspect everything a school does accurately, and then reduce it down to a one-word judgment. So I agree with Labour: we should either remove the judgment categories or stop trying to summarise the work that schools do with one word that is then used as a stick to beat schools with. We’d be better off if Ofsted judged schools annually on outcomes it is accurately able to quantify. The focus of the inspections, however, should be detached from the dataset and identify where practice is good and needs to improve. The inspection would then take on a completely different flavour, and use a broad body of research, evidence and training to support schools and help them improve. Madeleine Holt parent, north London Yes. I chose to send my child to a school that had just been told by Ofsted it “requires improvement”. Although I thought the judgment was absolutely right, I saw at close-hand the effect it had. The school lost a lot of pupils, it lost money and had to get rid of experienced staff, which meant it was harder for it to improve. In other countries you don’t have this totally punitive system. Teachers don’t need to be whipped into doing their jobs better. I think teachers genuinely want to provide the best quality education. It’s crucial to have inspections, but one- or two-day inspections are too short – you can’t get under the skin of the school. Nor can you accurately sum up a school with a one-word judgment. We need a way of assessing schools that results in a much more positive relationship and takes into account the wellbeing of students and staff and how inclusive the school is. At the moment, some schools discourage admission of children with additional needs because it affects their results. Support for school improvement has to be at a local level and come from experts who know the particular challenges of the schools in their area. I agree it would be good to have the option of more formal and less formal inspections by inspectors who are independent of the local authority – but those inspectors should have a constructive mindset. I’d like to see a network of successful former headteachers visiting schools regularly and providing ideas and connections. We need, as Angela Rayner says, a much more collaborative model of education, rather than pitting schools against each other. Keziah Featherstone headteacher, Q3 academy, Tipton, West Midlands Yes, but only if something better can replace it. I’m not sure whether Ofsted can be successfully overhauled, and every educational institution has to be accountable for its standards. I also think the safeguarding of children should be checked every year. What Ofsted does at the moment isn’t necessarily bad practice but it’s not contextualised. I’d like to see local audits every year by a former teacher or teaching specialist who understands the local area. They should take into account whether the school is surrounded by grammar schools or in an area of huge social deprivation, and consider whether the local authority is effective and if the level of funding is appropriate for that school. I’d love to get rid of judgments, as Labour proposes. At the moment, the process doesn’t feel very human. A one-word judgment is too simplistic, because even schools in special measures have fantastic stuff going on. But I’d worry about Labour’s proposal to give more control to local authorities. If you’ve got a really strong local authority, that’s fine. But in some areas, schools can be left to rot. I’d like to see schools have more of a say in who comes to see them. There are some absolutely cracking inspectors out there and I wouldn’t want to stop them doing their job. When they turn up and support you, and provide really useful feedback, it’s magic.
200	My boyfriend and I started having sex about three weeks ago, but have known each other a long time. He was a virgin before we started being intimate. When we do have sex, he doesn’t seem to be able to climax, which isn’t something I have encountered before. I can make him ejaculate when I use my hand, but intercourse and oral sex don’t seem to do much for him. He stays aroused and says he enjoys the intimacy, but he just doesn’t seem to get pleasure from intercourse. I don’t know why, and it’s making me very insecure. Try not to take this personally. A man who has experienced pleasure and orgasm only through masturbation needs time to adjust to being sexual with someone else. You can help him by encouraging him to be very frank about what feels good and what doesn’t. Perhaps he would even share his masturbation technique with you. If it tends to be very rough, then it would make sense that vaginal sex may not allow him to climax at this point. But no matter how he masturbates, the “bridging” of the different sensations – solo and vaginal/oral – is typically challenging to begin with. Be understanding about the fact that he is only just beginning to learn about lovemaking, and that it will take some time for his body and mind to adapt and his confidence to build. Sexual education is a continuing process throughout your life as changes occur in your body, desires, partner and life situation. Good communication is eternally essential for any couple. • Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders. • If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don’t send attachments).
