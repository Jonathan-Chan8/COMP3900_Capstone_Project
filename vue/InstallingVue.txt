To install Vue.js

1.  Download and install NPM from https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm then go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/ and download the 64 bit package file

2.  Run the following commands in the project directory:

    brew install yarn

    sudo npm uninstall vue-cli -g
    
    sudo npm install @vue/cli -g
        # OR
    yarn global add @vue/cli

    (i use npm, but we need yarn for upgrading vue later)

    vue --version (should be @vue/cli 4.5.7)

3. Now we need to upgrade all the packages and dependencies inside Vue with the following command:

    npm update -g @vue/cli

    If this produces an error saying that you need yarn, you'll need to install that via its website (if you dont have homebrew)

    This should not produce a list of all plugins being upgraded. You may get a message saying that this may produce breaking changes, just continue. The build works perfectly on the upgraded software, and in any case we should be building on the updated versions anyway.

3. Once that is done, run 'npm uninstall' and then 'npm install'. This may take some time, and may show a lot of warnings (this is normal). Hopefully, by the end, you should be receiving no vulnerabilites as all the dependent packages are not running on updated versions.
